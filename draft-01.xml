<li n=?>By a gentleman, we mean not to draw a line that would be invidious between high and low, rank and subordina-

<li n=?>law but his word to make him fulfil an engagement ;— such a man is a f;entleman ;— and such a man may De found

<p>
<li n=?>Of Shalispeare'' s Comedy of Love's Lahor's Lost before Qmai Elizabeth. 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>The subject of the accompanying plate is a fancy sketch by a celebrated English artist, named 
<li n=?>Buss, representing the performance of Shakspeare's comedy of Love's Labor's Lost, before queen 
<li n=?>Elizabeth and her Court. We believe, from the London papers, that the painter intended to repre- 
<li n=?>sent Shakspeare upon the stage before his august patron, in the performance of Don Adriano de Ar- 
<li n=?>mado, a fantastical Spaniard, a character in the above comedy. But we have no authority that the 
<li n=?>dramatist ever performed in the play in question, although we do not possess the power of contra- 
<li n=?>dicting the assertion. The nation and nature of the character, and the quaint allusion contained in 
<li n=?>its name, were undoubtedly designed as a grateful compliment to her virgin majesty. Shakspeare 
<li n=?>was indubitably a courtier, and spared no means of gratifying the weaknesses of Elizabeth and the 
<li n=?>prejudices of the day. The vilifying twisting of the character of Richard IIL, the mortal enemy of 
<li n=?>the giandfather of the queen, is a convincing evidence in support of our assertion. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The play of Love's Labor's Lost (so named in the folio of 1623,) is generally supposed to be the 
<li n=?>earliest of Shakspeare's productions. Malone assigns 1591 as the date of the original drama, but 
<li n=?>changed it afterwards, with sufficient reason, to 1594. Chalmers supposes 1592 as the year wherein 
<li n=?>this comedy was written, but gives no satisfactory cause for his preference. The original edition of 
<li n=?>this play is doubtless lost, for the oldest copy extant, dated 1598, is said, in the title page, to be 
<li n=?>" newly corrected and augmented." In 1597, it was represented at Wliitehall palace, before queen 
<li n=?>Elizabeth, by her express desire — we are then to suppose that we possess the copy of the piece as it 
<li n=?>■was " newly corrected and augmented" for the purpose of exhibition before her majesty. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>We have said that there is no autho.ity extant for the assu nption that Shakspeare personated 
<li n=?>Armado, even at the command of her majesty the quean. At the same time, if he played in ^

<li n=?>piece, he was likely to select tlie character of the thrasonical Spaniard, inasmuch as the broad hu- 
<li n=?>mors of the other masquers rendered them unavailable to an actor of our poet's calibre, and the parts 
<li n=?>of the dashing and witty courtiers were above his pitch. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In Ben Jonson's Every Man in his Humor, his name appears attached to Old Knowell; Adam, 
<li n=?>in his own As You Like It, was another of his assumptions. In Seganus, his name appears 
<li n=?>amongst the comedians — although we know that his ghost in Hamlet was one of his best perform- 
<li n=?>ances, and that he occasionally figured in vaiious of his kingly characters, such as the Fourth, Sixth, 
<li n=?>and Eighth Henrys in his own historical plays. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The last mention of Shakspeare's name as an actor appears in the list of characters attached to 
<li n=?>Ben Jonson's play of Seganus, published in 1603. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Queen Elizabeth frequently indulged in witnessing dramatic performances, produced at her own 
<li n=?>expense, within her own palace walls. The Cotton MSS. contain various charges made in the ac- 
<li n=?>counts of the Master of the Revels for velvets, silks, cloths of gold, etc., for setting forth the stage 
<li n=?>In the very first year of her reign, there is a notice of the players being stopped in their perform- 
<li n=?>ances in consequence of the objectionable matter which they represented. " The same day at nyghS 
<li n=?>(Christmas) at the quens court, ther was a play afor her grace, the whych the plaers plad shuche 
<li n=?>matter that they wher commandyd to leyff off, and continently the maske cam in dansyng." Ne- 
<li n=?>vertheless, we find on the same authority, that on the twelfth night following, " a skaffold" for the 
<li n=?>play was set up in the hall, and " after play was done ther was a goodly maske, and after, a giett 
<li n=?>bankett that last tyll midnyght," 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The " skaflTold in the hall" sounds rudely to a modern ear, as the chief appliance and means of 
<li n=?>dramatic display in the palatial abode of the queen of England. But the public stage was in its in- 
<li n=?>fancy at the time of Shakspeare's birth, and the conveniences and elegant fittings wherewith the 
<li n=?>drama of the present day is graced, were unknown to the most ardent well-wisher of the stage in 
<li n=?>the early days of Elizabeth's reign. Chalmers observes " that what Augustus said of Rome may be 
<li n=?>remarked of Elizabeth and the stage ; he found it brick and he left it marble." At her accession in 
<li n=?>1558, no regular theatre had been established, and the players of that period, even in the capital, 
<li n=?>were compelled to have recourse to the yards of great inns, as the most commodious places which 
<li n=?>they could obtain for the representation of their pieces. These being surrounded by open stages and 
<li n=?>galleries, and possessing hkewise numerous private apartments and recesses, from which the gen- 
<li n=?>teeler part of the audience might become spectators at their ease, while the central space held a tem 
<li n=?>porary stage, uncovered m fine weather, and protected by an awning in bad, were not ill calculated 
<li n=?>for the purposes of scenic exhibition, and most undoubtedly gave rise to the form and construction 
<li n=?>adopted in the erection of the licensed theatres. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In consequence of Elizabeth's patronage, the drama rapidly assumed an important stand. A re- 
<li n=?>gular play-house was built in the Blackfriars in 1570, and in 1574, Burbage's regular company of 
<li n=?>players was established by royal license. Before the sixteenth century expired, fouiteen distinct 
<li n=?>companies of players exhilirated the golden days of good queen Bess, Shakspeare's name appearing 
<li n=?>on the list enrolled by lord Warwick and the lord Chamberlain. Theatres, of course, proportionately 
<li n=?>increased ; and during the time that Shakspeare immortalized the stage, not less than seven of these 
<li n=?>structures, of established popularity, were in existence, with various others of ephemeral notoriety.

<h1>INTRODUCTION. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>The frigate Constitution has a deathless fame. There is a charm in her simple name that arrests 
<li n=?>the eye, and rivets the attention of the cursory readei. Old Ironsides! Why the hare mention of 
<li n=?>this sobriquet carries us back to the days of Nicholson and Talbot, to the actions with the Guerriere, 
<li n=?>the Java, and the Cyane and the Levant; and we fancy that we hear the roar of her cannon, the 
<li n=?>blast of her bugle, her cry of enthusiasm as she went into battle, and her loud huzza as she came 
<li n=?>out victoriously ; — before us, a Hull, a Bainbridge, and a Stewart appear, together with a host of 
<li n=?>other choice spirits, both officers and men, who trod her blood-stained decks, and shared her impe- 
<li n=?>rishable glory. Her picture is in almost every dwelling ; she marks the covers of toy books and 
<li n=?>paper reams, and hangs over the door of the seaman's rendezvous. The backwoodsman, in his log 
<li n=?>cabin amid the western forest, has counted her guns, and puzzled over her ropes. Every nation un- 
<li n=?>der heaven has seen her; and her deeds have been the talk of the civilized world. Tiuly, she is 
<li n=?>the lucky ship of our navy ! the pride of every patriot, and the boast of every American citizen ; 
<li n=?>and, sooner than surrender her to an enemy, every son of this vast republic should feel willing to 
<li n=?>go down with her to the blue depths of ocean with her drums beating and colors flying, and hear 
<li n=?>with pleasure the thunder of the scowling wave as it closes over her " pennon, spar, and sail." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It is usual when men of mighty genius, of gallant bearing, of holy zeal, and of noble ancestry, ap- 
<li n=?>pear on this mundane sphere, for some contemporary to give a minute account of their lives and ac- 
<li n=?>tions ; and so far is the custom carried at the present day, that the curtain of domestic life is clewed up, 
<li n=?>and we are shown the mysteries behind the scenes. Will it be considered strange, then, if one shall 
<li n=?>■write a series of sketches of the deeds of the gallant Constitution 1 Surely, if each Httle great man 
<li n=?>has his Boswell, Old Ironsides shall have her trumpeter ! 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In the following pages, fact will be blended with fancy in such a manner as not to murder truth, 
<li n=?>and the author will endeavor to twine for himself a wreath from the inexhaustible laurel that now 
<li n=?>blooms from the stump of her keel, and hangs around her frame. Startling incidents from each 
<li n=?>cruize will be taken from authentic sources, and what has been omitted by the pen of history, will 
<li n=?>be added hy that of memory. In many instances, the details of others will be copied, taking care 
<li n=?>never to do so, without making proper acknowledgment in the notes at the bottom of the page. 
<li n=?>Having trod the deck of this noble frigate, and heard the piping of the gale through her rigging, and 
<li n=?>the thunder of her cannon above the shifting valleys of ocean, the author feels confident that he shali 
<li n=?>he able to serve up the dear old ship like a skilful cook, in a hundred different ways, and unfold 
<li n=?>many a deed of high and noble daring. 
</p>

<li n=?>
<h1>EARLY HISTORY. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>Tlie frigate Constitution was laid down at Boston, Mass., under an act of Congress, approved 
<li n=?>March 27lh, 1794. She was modelled by Joshua Humphreys, Esq., of Philndelphia, — the father of 
<li n=?>the present talented Chief Naval Constructor, — who likewise modelled the frigates President, Uni- 
<li n=?>ted States, Chesapeake, Constellation, and Congress. She was rated a forty-four gun ship, but like 
<li n=?>all other rated ships, both English and American, she carried more guns than were named. She 
<li n=?>had thirty port-holes on the gun deck, and twenty-four on the spar deck, and her number of service* 
<li n=?>able cannon was fifty-four. She carries that number now.

<li n=?>14 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>On the 30th of September, 1797, she ghded into her natural element amid the shouts of thousands 
<li n=?>of spectators, who had collected to witness the novel sight, and had she not stuck on the ways at an 
<li n=?>earlier period, she would have been the first vessel launched under the new organization of the navy. 
<li n=?>As it was, she was baptized with blood — a ship carpenter, by the name of Champney, having been 
<li n=?>killed by the falling of one of her shoars. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>On the 20th July, 1798, she got underway for the first time, under the command of Captain Sa- 
<li n=?>muel Nicholson, a gallant officer ; and in August cruized with four revenue cutters along the coast 
<li n=?>of the United States, to the southward of Cape Heniy. At the close of the year '98, while under 
<li n=?>the command of Captain Nicholson, she was attached to the West India squadron, commanded by 
<li n=?>Commodore Barry. In 1799, she became the flag ship of Commodore Talbot, on the St, Domingo 
<li n=?>station, and here she commenced her gallant career. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Having thus brought the old ship down to the commencement of the present century, we leave 
<li n=?>the reader to learn her farther history from the following sketches and anecdotes. 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>CUTTING OUT A LETTER OF MARQUE. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>Of all services of danger which a naval officer has to perform during a time of war, and there are 
<li n=?>^uany, the task of cutting out an armed vessel from under the guns of an enemy's foit, and bringing 
<li n=?>-her out of the harbor in safety, is considered the most desperate. Coolness and courage must travel 
<li n=?>hand in hand there; and the successful commander of such an expedition, under the most favorable 
<li n=?>circumstances, must consider himself well off if he earns his laurels at the cost of blood. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The sun was slowly descending behind the blue peaks of San Domingo, when an American -fri- 
<li n=?>gate came in sight of the village of Port Platte, situated at the head of a small liaibor on tire south 
<li n=?>■side of the island, and, furling her courses, hove to, for tlie pui-pose of reconnoitering. After scan- 
<li n=?>iiing narrowly the little anchorage, the frigate put about, and, setting her courses, was soon lost amid 
<li n=?>the shades of night. The inhabitants of the village had felt great alarm at the near approach of the 
<li n=?>armed ship, and had reinforced their fort, beside sending a number of soldiers on board of the letter 
<li n=?>of marque, Sandwich, formerly a British packet, but now in the service of the French, which lay 
<li n=?>close under the guns of the fort, wheie she was receiving a cargo of coffee, previous to her making 
<li n=?>a run for France. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was in the year 1800, just after the action between the Constellation and La Vengeance, and 
<li n=?>Uic name of the conqueror, Truxton, passed from lip to lip with instinctive consternation. Night 
<li n=?>came on; the moon had not appeared, and scudding clouds obscured the stars. The reveilM had 
<li n=?>been beaten at the garrison, and the inhabitants of Port Platte had retired to dream of the daring 
<li n=?>cruizers of the American squadron. The frigate, when she had lost sight of the island, came about, 
<li n=?>and under easy sail stood in for the shore. She was the Constitution, Commodore Talbot, and from 
<li n=?>the silence that reigned throughout the ship, and the total absence of light from the battle lanterns, 
<li n=?>the most careless observer would have supposed that she was about to do sometliing for the glory of 
<li n=?>the old thirteen. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>As she drew nigh the port, two officers might have been seen at the gangway, watching narrowly 
<li n=?>the lights that twinkled ahead. At this moment, the heavy roar of a cannon came echoing along 
<li n=?>the waters, and then one after another, the lights disappeared, until none were seen but those which 
<li n=?>seemed to be designed to burn throughout the night. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Now is your time," said the elder of the persons to the younger ; "have the second cutter man- 
<li n=?>ned, sir, and come to me for farther orders." Thus saying, the commodore, for it was he, looked at the 
<li n=?>compass and entered the cabin. In a few minutes, a knock at the cabin door, announced the arrival 
<li n=?>of some officer to make a report. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Enter," said the bluff old commodore, and immediately lieutenant Hull, the first of the Consti- 
<li n=?>tution, stood before him. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Are you ready 1'' said the commodore. 
<li n=?>" All ready, sir," replied the lieutenant. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Then, sir," said the commodore, " you will enter the harbor of Port Platte without being dia- 
<li n=?>covered, ascertain whether the ciaft that lies under the guns of the fort is the Sandwich, and when 
<li n=?>you shall have done so, return and make a report to me." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" How shall I ascertain that fact without boarding her 1" said the lieutenant. 
<li n=?>" You will know her to be the Sandwich," replied the commodore, " by the black stripes around 
<li n=?>her white masts, and by the shortness of her bowsprit. Make haste, sir, for I long to give you a 
<li n=?>job." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The lieutenant smiled as he bade the commodore good night, and, immediately ascending, gave 
<li n=?>such orders to the officer of the deck as he deemed necessary under the citcumstances of the case. 
<li n=?>The night was pretty well advanced as Mr. Hull wrapped himself in his boat cloak, and seated him- 
<li n=?>self in the stern sheets of the second cutter. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Shove off— let fall — pull cheerily, my boys," were the orders he gave, in a low voice, in quick 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>

<p>
<li n=?>SQCCession ; then passing swiftly around the frigate's stern, he pulled for the harbor, and was soon 
<li n=?>lost sight of. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>For two hours, nothing was heard of the adventurous ofircer or his boat, and the old commodore 
<li n=?>began to grow quite anxious about them. Already a pale streak stretched itself along the eastern 
<li n=?>waters, and the clouds giew thinner and fewer, while here and there a star peeped out, and was re- 
<li n=?>flected back by the waves below. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Boat ahoy '." challenged the sentinel at the gangway of the Constitution, as the dash of oars at 
<li n=?>this moment fell upon his ear. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"Aye! aye !" replied the officer of the boat, and soon lieutenant Hull crossed the gangway of the 
<li n=?>^ip. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" It is the Sandwich, sir," said the lieutenant, after reporting his return, and paying the custom- 
<li n=?>ary salute. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Are you certain!" said commodore Talbot. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I am, sir," replied the officer, " for I lay directly under hex stern, and heard through the cabin 
<li n=?>•windows, which were open, her officers congratulating themselves upon the departure of the Con- 
<li n=?>stellation, for such they deem this ship to be. Beside, I noticed her masts and bowsprit, as I swept 
<li n=?>along under the guns of the fort — they are as you described them to be." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I'll have her, by ," said commodore Talbot, as he looked again at the harbor, which began 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>to show itself amid the haze of dawn. " About ship, sir — set all the studding sails," and, bidding 
<li n=?>the heutenant good night, the commander in chief bounced into his cabin. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The frigate swiftly came about, and took her departure from the land. Soon the studding sails 
<li n=?>on both sides were spread out to the wind, and, like a mountain of snow, she danced along upon 
<li n=?>the bosom of the deep until her morning watch looked out in vain for the blue outline of the island 
<li n=?>of San Domingo. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Sail O !" cried the look-out. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Where away " said the officer of the deck. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" On the lee bow, sir," replied the seaman. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Can you make her out 1" hailed the officer. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>«' She is a sloop, sir, and shows American colors." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Hoist our ensign," said the lieutenant. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Aye, there comes the Sally in the nick of time." said the commodore, who had left the cabin at 
<li n=?>the first hail. " Mr. Hull, make a signal for hei to run down and speak us ; we will soon proceed 
<li n=?>to business." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In a short time, the sail, which proved to be the American sloop Sally, came alongside of the Con- 
<li n=?>stitution. After a conference with her captain, he and his crew came on board the frigate, while 
<li n=?>lieutenant Hull, with a party of seamen and marines, the latter led by the brave captain Carmick 
<li n=?>immediately repaired on board of the sloop. Having received orders from the commodore, the sloop 
<li n=?>now put her helm up, and ran for the island. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" In the course of the night, while running down for her port under easy sail, a shot suddenly 
<li n=?>flew over the Sally, and soon after an English frigate ranged up alongside. Mr. Hull hove to and 
<li n=?>when the boarding lieutenant gained the sloop's deck, where he found so large a party of men and 
<li n=?>officers in naval unifoims, he was much surprised. He was told the object of the expedition how- 
<li n=?>ever, and expressed his disappointment, as his own ship was only waiting to let the Sandwich com- 
<li n=?>plete her cargo, in order to cut her out also."* 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was about^noon of the following day when the sloop stood in to the harbor of Port Platte. Be- 
<li n=?>fore her lay the Sandwich, with her broadside bearing on the approach ; and in the rear of her at 
<li n=?>no great distance, a battery shov/ed its long row of black teeth for her protection. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Lieutenant Hull had sent nearly all the men below, before he entered the harbor, and now, having 
<li n=?>a stern anchor ready, he bore down, like a short-handed lubberly sloop, for the bows of the Sand- 
<li n=?>wich. As he drew nigh the ship, he said, in a low voice, " Stand by to board," and soon a large 
<li n=?>number of men crouched under the bulwarks, ready for action. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" You will be afoul of me," said the lieutenant of the Sandwich, who was leaning carelessly over 
<li n=?>the bulwark as the sloop came down. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I think I shall," was the laconic reply. In a moment, the sloop struck the bows of the enemy. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Let go the kedge '." thundered the lieutenant — it was done like magic. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Boarders, away !" cried he ; and, seizing his cutlass, he crossed the gangway of the Sandwich 
<li n=?>at the head of his men, and carried her without a struggle. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Captain Carmick, in the ship's boats, now landed, carried the battery, spiked the guns, and retired 
<li n=?>without the loss of a man. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A great commotion was nov/ perceptible on shore ; but the commander and his crew went swiftly 
<li n=?>to work to secure their prize, and, though she was dismantled above her deck, and her guns stowed 
<li n=?>in the hold, before sunset she had her royal yards crossed, her guns scaled, and her crew quartered.

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The United States ship Talbot, I. Hull, commander," replied the victorious officer, as he drew 
<li n=?>near enough to be distinguished by the othcers of the frigate. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" It is Hull, by heavens !" said the commodore. In a few minutes lieutenant Hull came on board 
<li n=?>and made his official report. After a short time, the Sally's captain and crew were returned to their 
<li n=?>vessel, with many thanks, and lieutenant Hull, having received orders to that effect, repaired on 
<li n=?>board the prize as her commander, and, crowding on all sail, followed the commodore to Jamaica.

<h1>APEEPATMOKOCCO. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>In 1803, we find our favorite ship, bearing the broad pendant of commodore Preble, entering the 
<li n=?>Mediterranean, to battle with the powers of Barbary. Octol)er 6th, 1803, the frigate Philadelphia, 
<li n=?>captain Bainbridge, captured off Cape de Gatta a cruizer belonging to the emperor of Morocco, call- 
<li n=?>ed the Meshboha, of twenty-two guns, Ibrahim Lubarez, commander, with a crew of one hundred 
<li n=?>aaid twenty men. This vessel having piratically seized the brig Celia, of Boston, commodore Pre- 
<li n=?>Me, in the Constitution, accompanied by the Nautilus, and the return squadron of commodore Kod- 
<li n=?>gers, sailed for Tangier Bay, for the purpose of convincing the brother of the sun and moon that a 
<li n=?>war with the United States would inevitably result in the destruction of his piratical navy, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Tangier is situated on the northern coast of Africa, but a short distance from Cape Spartel. It 
<li n=?>S a walled city of Morocco, and is rarely if ever visited excepting by market boats and vessels of 
<li n=?>war, on account of the long quarantine which is imposed by ports higher up the Mediterranean, 
<li n=?>upon all vessels who may have touched there. It lies thirty miles west of Gibraltar, is strongly foi- 
<li n=?>tified, has fourteen thousand inhabitants, and is the principal sea-port of the Moors. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Its appearance from the sea is beautiful. Castles and forts of white stone, with the blood red flag 
<li n=?>•floating over each baslioh ; numerous white buildings, with the flags of every commercial nation 
<li n=?>waving in the breeze above them. Groves of orange and cypress trees towering above the walls, 
<li n=?>Hiark the foreground ; while far in the blue distance, the mountains of Mauritania towering in gran- 
<li n=?>deur, and to the left, and nigh at hand, the wild and broken summits of Mount Abyla — or in com- 
<li n=?>3cnon parlance, Apes Hill — rising high above the straits, complete a picture which, for variety and 
<li n=?>beauty, is rarely equalled in the Mediteiranean. If you turn to the opposite shore, you behold, peep- 
<li n=?>ing out from its beautiful olive groves, the little town of Tarifa, in Andalusia, celebrated as the spot 
<li n=?>where the Moors first landed, undei Taric el Tuerto, and commenced the conquest of Spain ; and far- 
<li n=?>ther out from the main land, you see its light-house, pointing the wandering mariner to the passage be- 
<li n=?>tween the pillars of Hercules; and, farther up the straits, behold "Dark Calpe's frowning steep," 
<li n=?>rising like a watchful lion to guard the sunny sea. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In an inexhaustible' stone quaiTy near the city, which has been worked from time immemorial, to 
<li n=?>supply the Moors with mill stones, there stood a pillar, with an inscription upon its base, which in- 
<li n=?>formed the reader that it was raised by the wandering Canaanites, who had been driven out of their 
<li n=?>land, " flowing with milk and honey," by Joshua, the son of Nun ; and from the solid blocks of 
<li n=?>stone that lie about the entrance, and the great extent of the excavation — which reaches out to the 
<li n=?>sea — it requires but a little stretch of the human mind to believe that the children of Anak once 
<li n=?>labored there.

<p>
<li n=?>It was sunrise at the straits of Gibraltar, when an American squadron stood by Tarifa point, and 
<li n=?>liove to in the bay of Tangier. The shores were sleeping in misty splendor, as the commodore furl- 
<li n=?>ed his topsails and made a signal for the squadron to anchor. Having secured the ships, a salute of 
<li n=?>twenty-one guns was fired, with the flag of Morocco floating at the fore, which was speedily answer- 
<li n=?>ed by the battery on shore. Freedom and slavery now lay side by side ; the stars and the stripes, 
<li n=?>and the bloody ensigns of the corsairs, waved together in the breeze, while the rattling of the Con- 
<li n=?>sxitution's drums mingled with the clashing of the Mussulman's cymbals. It was a stirring hour — 
<li n=?>the emperor's household had heard the roar of artillery, and wonder sate upon every countenance. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was yet early in the morning when the most sublime and mighty prince of Mauritania, aroused 
<li n=?>from his quiet sleep in his drowsy harem by the report of the Constitution's cannon, repaired to the 
<li n=?>divan, and held high court. There was a scowl upon his brow as he twisted his magnificent mus- 
<li n=?>tachios, and his thin lip curled in scorn, while his dark eye flashed with unusual brilliancy. Be- 
<li n=?>fore him, were the abject subjects of his will, and myriads of heads bent down in homage as he 
<li n=?>seated himself, while his body guards, in jewelled robes and spotted turbans, with pomp and pride, 
<li n=?>took their stations behind his ottoman. At length, beckoning to the bey, he said — " What dogs are 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>OLD IRONSIDES. IT </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>these which disturb our ro3aI sleep before the hour of morning prayer 1 Hasten, Hassan, and bring 
<li n=?>us information." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The bey informed him that a large squadron of American vessels of war had anchored in the 
<li n=?>harbor. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Mishalla !" said the emperor, with a look of apprehension, " let them be attended to." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A white flag now streamed from the nearest bastion, which was answered by a similar display 
<li n=?>from every ship in the squadron ; and then a boat shot from the side of the Constitution, with a 
<li n=?>noble-looking oflicer in her stern-sheets, whose uniform showed him to be a captain in the navy of 
<li n=?>the United States. He was commodore Preble. In a short half hour, the emperor gave the gallant 
<li n=?>commodore an audience, and Mr. Simpson, the American consul, was placed upon a footing with, 
<li n=?>the consuls of the most favored nations. The emperor, through his interpreter, expressed his regret 
<li n=?>that any difference had arisen between the two nations, disavowed having given any hostile orders, 
<li n=?>and declared that he would punish any of his governors who had. He then gave an order, under 
<li n=?>his seal, for the release of the American brig Hannah, her cargo and crew, detained at Mogadore ; 
<li n=?>and the commodore gave up the Meshboha, the vessel taken by captain Bainbridge, and the Mis- 
<li n=?>houda, the vessel taken by commodore Rodgers, at an earlier period of the war. Having smoked a 
<li n=?>pipe and drunk the coffee of the most illustrious Moor, the commander of the squadron was about 
<li n=?>to retire from the presence chamber, when the emperor suddenly clapped his hands. Hassan Bey 
<li n=?>stepped forwaid. " Bring me the pen of my father, and the treaty made between him and the new 
<li n=?>world," said he, " that I may sign my name, and afHx my seal to it." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The pen and the parchment scroll were then brought in, and Hassan Bey, having unrolled the 
<li n=?>latter on his bended knees, the emperor, in the presence of his divan, made his mark and affixed his 
<li n=?>seal below the ratification of his father ; and it is just to state, that ever afterwards he observed its 
<li n=?>stipulations with the strictness of an honest Mussulman. Three years ago, this treaty, which was 
<li n=?>to continue fifty years from its date, expired, and a new one was entered into, which is now in force. 
<li n=?>It is not a httle singular that the frigate Constitution, at the request of the consul of Tangier, made 
<li n=?>her second appearance off that port in 1836, to hasten a treaty with the emperor of Morocco. Will 
<li n=?>she, fifty years hence, be ready to do the same thing  God grant it. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>After the usual ceremonies of leave-taking, the divan broke up ; the commodore then repaired on 
<li n=?>board his ship, and fired a salute ; the consul hoisted his flag again over his consulate, and the squad- 
<li n=?>ron getting under way, the Constitution stood up the straits followed by the Nautilus, while com- 
<li n=?>modore Rodgers and the return squadron proceeded to the United Slates. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>There is nothing like loaded cannon for expediting the consummation of a 'treaty with the Moors, 
<li n=?>and the only tribute that will satisfy them for ever, must consist of thirty-two pourvJ shot. There 
<li n=?>is no mistaking the meaning of such presents, and when offered by a Preble, from the deck of the 
<li n=?>Constitution, they — as we shall see hereafter — protected the flag, and increased the glory of his na- 
<li n=?>tive land. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>At midnight, as the Constitution, under easy sail, was beating up for Gibraltar, " she suddenly 
<li n=?>found herself alongside a large ship. Some hailing passed, without either party giving an answer ; 
<li n=?>commodore Preble, who had taken the trumpet himself, now told the name and country of his ship,, 
<li n=?>and his own rank. He then demanded the name of the stranger, adding that he would fire a shot 
<li n=?>unless answered. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" ' If you fire a shot, I'll return a broadside,' was the reply. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Preble sprang into his mizen rigging, applied the trumpet, and said — ' This is the United States 
<li n=?>ship Constitution, a forty-four, commodore Edward Preble; I am about to hail you for the last time ; 
<li n=?>if not answered, I shall fire into you. What ship is that V 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" ' This is his Britannic Majesty's ship Donnegal, a razee of sixty guns.' 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Preble told the stranger he doubted his statement, and should lie by him until morning, in order 
<li n=?>to ascertain his real character. He was as good as his word, and in a short time, a boat came from 
<li n=?>the other vessel to explain. It was an English /rig-a^e, and the Constitution had got so suddenly 
<li n=?>and unexpectedly alongside of her, that the hesitation about answering, and the fictitious name, had 
<li n=?>proceeded from a desire to gain time, in order to clear the ship and to get to quarters. The spirit of 
<li n=?>commodore Preble on this occasion produced a very favorable impression in his own ship ; the young: 
<li n=?>men pithily remarking, that if he was wrong in his temper, he was right in his heart."* 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The next morning, the Constitution came to anchor off Gibraltar, and thus ended the war with-. 
<li n=?>Morocco.

<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>Evert village which has seen its third generation, and every public building -which has survived 
<li n=?>the peltings of a half century's storms, claim as a part of their natural possessions, a larger or smaller 
<li n=?>portion of legendary lore. It is the powerful principle of association which imparts its interest to the 
<li n=?>antique dwelling or dismantled tower ; and as we gaze upon them, the imagination pierces the mist 
<li n=?>of the past and enlivens the scene with beings of its own creation. We go back to years long since 
<li n=?>commingled with the ocean of eternity, and see the busy actors of life's drama, as they performed 
<li n=?>their parts in the particular acts assigned them; and although they have flitted off the stage, the the 
<li n=?>atre of their performance is still before us. It affords us pleasure even when we are thrown solely 
<li n=?>tipon our imagination for persons and incidents to complete the scene : but the effort is less when we 
<li n=?>are supported with the principal events by history or tradition. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>No public building, perhaps, of the same age, affords as much food to the lover of incident, as a 
<li n=?>college. Changing its occupants every year ; its inhabitants collected promiscuously from all ranks 
<li n=?>of society, and possessing every possible shade of character and temperament, — its history must ne- 
<li n=?>cessarily be diversified. If the walls of our older institutions had tongues, how many thrilling tales 
<li n=?>of high anticipations, youthful enthusiasm, powerful effort and blasted hopes, might they disclose ! 
<li n=?>I have often listened to the breeze as it sighed through the long halls of our building, and imagined 
<li n=?>that it bore to my ear the merry peals of laughter which have rung through its chambers, mingled 
<li n=?>with the low sighs of many a hardened heart which has told its sorrow to that heedless breeze. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>There is one tale of grief connected with our alma mater, which has floated among us as a con- 
<li n=?>stituent part of hei earlier history. About thirty years ago, among the many who were here engaged 
<li n=?>in the enthusiastic strife for literary acquirement, there were two young hearts whose warm currents 
<li n=?>have long since been frozen in death. The rising sun of their hopes was early shrouded in a dark 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>cloud which cast a melancholy shadow over the history of their lives. T of Kentucky, was a 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>young man of respectable parts, but bold, passionate, and supercilious. Although his talents might 
<li n=?>have gained him respect, his disposition created an aversion to him among his companions and fellow 
<li n=?>students. He had that haughtiness in his carriage which is always sure to render a member of a 
<li n=?>society, as united as that of a college, disagreeable and unpopular. In the assignment of chambers 
<li n=?>he obtained as his room-mate a young gentleman who differed as much from him in disposition as 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>the zenith does from the nadir. C was a quiet gentle soul. He possessed those qualities which 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>secured him the warmest aflections of all around him. Although in delicate health, and generally 
<li n=?>pensive and retiring, the natural kindness and warmth of his feelings which gushed up like a full 
<li n=?>spring, endeared him to every one who formed an intimacy with him. As they differed so much iu 
<li n=?>their disposition, it is not to be expected that their mutual company would be agreeable. For some 
<li n=?>time, however, the restraint which a slight acquaintance imposed, prevented an exhibition of impro- 
<li n=?>priety on the part of the former, or uneasiness in the latter, but as they became more familiar, the 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>spirit of T showed itself in unkind treatment to his room-mate. The sensitive heart of C 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>could not brook the continued injury and unjustifiable abuse which was heaped upon him day after 
<li n=?>day. The presence of his insulter rendered his room the most disagreeable place on earth to him, 
<li n=?>and when absent his mind brooded over the incurable wounds which had been inflicted upon him. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>We gave T warning that a continuance of his conduct would be visited with retribution; but 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>still he persisted in the same treatment which he before observed. In an evil hour C sent him a 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>note, demanding gentlemanly satisfaction. The challenge was accepted, and the necessary preli- 
<li n=?>minaries arranged.

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Day was just dawning, and the pencil of light which streamed across the eastern horizon, pro- 
<li n=?>claimed the rising morning. The stars had not yet ceased to be visible. The citizens of our quiet 
<li n=?>tovsm were yet wrapt in the arms of sleep. To a verdawt lane within sight of the college, two small 
<li n=?>groups of persons were seen to move. ' There was a solemnity in their deportment which indicated

<p>
<li n=?>that the occasion which called them out was not one of a lively nature. They moved with a firm,r. 
<li n=?>decisive step, as though neiving themselves to receive some sudden shock, or witness a painful catas- 
<li n=?>trophe. They stopped when they reached the lane, and a few minutes Vv^ere spent in conversation, — 
<li n=?>quick and hurried, — as though they feared that some superior force would suspend their operations. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was a duel scene. The ground wasmeasured ; the frail form of C and the tall person of T 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>took their assigned station as the principal actors in the tragedy about to be enacted. Their weapons 
<li n=?>■were handed them, and each intent upon the horrid purpose of taking his brother's life, prepared to 
<li n=?>send his stained soul into the presence of a pure God. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was a moment of dread suspense. Hearts were beating then which might soon cease to pulsate 
<li n=?>forever. The shrine of many a holy affection and feeling, which if properly cultivated would have 
<li n=?>led them to honor and happiness, might soon be irreparably destroyed. The sun which should soon 
<li n=?>salute the earth with his blessed light, would look upon the happy homes of their childhood, where 
<li n=?>they had been caressed by the fondness of parents and friends, and where they were still remembered 
<li n=?>"with the kindest solicitude. Perhaps his first rays would greet an afleclionate mother in her chamber, 
<li n=?>mingling the most fervent petitions for her son's happiness with her morning orisons; and that son 
<li n=?>might be lost to her for ever. With quick succession, such thoughts passed through their fevered 
<li n=?>brain. A moment — a report — and the deed was done. C was wounded and fell. The re- 
<li n=?>mainder of the party, influenced by a dastardly cowardice wliich deserves to be branded, fled with 
<li n=?>precipitation. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>There lay the dying one, alone. The stream of his heart's blood was gurgling through the wound, 
<li n=?>and as he fell with his head down a declivity, it rushed through his throat, choking him with it&amp; 
<li n=?>warm current. It was vain to struggle with death. He had challenged the monster to the combat, 
<li n=?>and now felt his inabihty to meet him. And then to die in such a situation - — with no kind friend 
<li n=?>to support the drooping head, and wipe the death-damp from the brow. Doubtless as he entered the 
<li n=?>dark avenue to the other world, fond memory presented the bright images of past joys, of kind sisters, 
<li n=?>of affectionate friends. In vain the earth put on her vernal robe, — he had looked upon her beauties. 
<li n=?>for the last time. It is painful to be ushered into the eternal world under any circumstances; but 
<li n=?>how terrible it is when we rashly tear aside the curtain which veils that future state of existence 
<li n=?>iirom us, and read upon the broad orb of eternity, our own condemnation. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A melancholy fate is recorded of T . Warned by the spirit of his murdered companion, he 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>left his native country, and sought to banish his painful feelings by visiting foreign lands. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Ccelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt. The image was still before him : it abode 
<li n=?>Twith him in private, followed him in public, and glared fearfully upon him in his midnight dreams. 
<li n=?>It preyed upon his mind until settled dejection took place, which finally terminated in decided in-» 
<li n=?>sanity. A wild maniac, he roamed over Italy. The balmy breath of her zephyrs brought no calm 
<li n=?>to his soul ; he regarded not the famous softness of her sky. He, who had been nursed upon the 
<li n=?>lap of luxury, depended on the cold charity of those to whom he was bound by no tie but that of 
<li n=?>common humanity; his haughty spirit was broken, and the pround superstructure of his mind was a 
<li n=?>desolate ruin. He laid him in that stranger land, where no kind friend could pen his epitaph.

<li n=?>If you have hitherto escaped the grasp of the sheriff's officers, if the cuffs of your sleeves have not

<li n=?>is one of those unspeakable sensations which you will not again experience, save in Tartarus; thatis^ 
<li n=?>if old Minos shall think fit to condemn you. A few days ago, I was still free in that anomalous liberty, 
<li n=?>which knoweth not the clear light of heaven, and defendeth itself from the sun. Ferreted out by the 
<li n=?>commercial blood-hound, I was forced early in the morning from my ensconcement in a garret, where 
<li n=?>I was sleeping, neither well nor ill, until such time as it would be day with me, and still night witli 
<li n=?>the rest of mankind. Last Friday, as the town clock was striking eight —

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>With these words, I put on a light surtout, and directed my uncertain steps toward the Palais Eoy-

<li n=?>Capital ! My instinct as a debtor irresistibly hurried me to such a representation. I entered pre- 
<li n=?>cisely as the curtain rose, and took the first seat that offeied. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Aigentieres was just like myself, a night-bird; invited to a soiree, it there chances that he forgets 
<li n=?>himself, amid punch and the card-tables. At the rising of the sun he dares not venture into the 
<li n=?>streets, for he has perceived from the window a visage of bad omen : 't is that of a sheriff-officer, 
<li n=?>planted at the door of the hotel like a gibbet, and awaiting his victim with fatal vigilance. It was 
<li n=?>necessary, then, that Argentieres should devise a thousand pretexts for remaining at his post till even-

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"How shall I manage"!" exclaimed Perlet. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>His embarrassing position drew from me an exclamation and sympathetic applause. My right 
<li n=?>hand neighbor, a very troublesome fellow, applied his glass and eyed my countenance with an im- 
<li n=?>pertinence truly provoking. I silently contented myself with turning my back to him, and offering^ 
<li n=?>a more befitting view; but the fellow, whose gaze partook somewhat of the satanical, ceased notfrcirj 
<li n=?>his scrutiny of my person ; above all, at that moment when the v/inding-up of the piece extracted a 
<li n=?>new burst of sympathy. My patience was exhausted, and I gave him an intentional push, hy acci- 
<li n=?>dent. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" My dear sir! your address," said he to me, while re-adjusting his glass, which had been deraugedl 
<li n=?>by my abrupt motion.

<p>
<li n=?>" Ah! very well," added he, reading the name and number of my street; "you shall see me, sir,

<li n=?>And song burst from every bill ;

<li n=?>And the dews on our hearts and our homes 
<li n=?>Lay sweet as our balm in bee-combs ; — 
<li n=?>In the sultry succeeding of noon,

<li n=?>Came amidst us ; and seeming devotion

<li n=?>a blasted pine in a grove of beauty; groves of orange trees, filled with the "golden apple" scattered 
<li n=?>in every direction by the tasteful and profuse hand of nature, give a rich beauty and softness to the 
<li n=?>scene, while in bold relief are seen the massy Gavia and the well known sugar-loaf, nature's hand-

<p>
<li n=?>The shores of Botafogo Bay are lined with villas of surpassing beauty and neatness of architecture ; 
<li n=?>among which stands pre-eminent that of the late beautiful Countess of Santos, a monument at once 
<li n=?>of the fiailty of its fair occupant and the munificence of her imperial lover, Pedro the First. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>I have been thus particular in the description, or rather in this poor attempt at description, of this 
<li n=?>lovely spot, from its being the scene of the events I am about to narrate ; and as the facts upon which 
<li n=?>this " ower true tale" are founded, did actually occur. I might in compliance with the long observed 
<li n=?>rule of scribbling, premise, " that the actors in the drama, or some of them, being still alive, delicacy 
<li n=?>forbids me to disclose their names, etc." Such, I believe, is admitted to be a privilege of long stand- 
<li n=?>ing, and I might be disposed to avail myself of it, but for the simple reason, that I do not know the 
<li n=?>real names of any one mentioned in my story, although I once heard them ; nor do I know whether 
<li n=?>they are ahve or dead, but I think I hear my fair reader exclaim, (while more than half inclined to 
<li n=?>throw away this nonsense,) the story, sir, the story ; thus, then it is : 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In the year 18 — ; but before I proceed any farther, I ought to tell you how I became acquainted 
<li n=?>with the facts I relate, and begging the pardon of any one, whose patience has accompanied me thus 
<li n=?>far, for drawing a little more upon their stock thereof, I will, in as brief a way as possible, state the 
<li n=?>the how, when, and where. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was on an evening of surpassing loveliness, such as is no where seen but in the tropics, that 
<li n=?>after having spent a day of solitude in my hammock, trying by inactivity and passiveness to escape 
<li n=?>the heat, as the thermometer had been playfully ranging from 90 to 100 in the shade, with no 
<li n=?>society but my Byron, my own thoughts, (poor company, I think I see you preparing to remark, so

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>that I will save you the trouble by confessing it myself,) and though last, by no means least, a choice 
<li n=?>"Havana," the which I can confidently recommend to every one, as the greatest of luxuries in a 
<li n=?>warm climate, where was I, oh ! I had just got out of my hammock, (another luxury,) and deter- 
<li n=?>lermined to enjoy to the utmost the coolness of the evening. I entered my canoe, and with my only 
<li n=?>attendant, (cook, valet, and chambermaid, " trio juncta in uno'' as Sheridan said,) paddled down the 
<li n=?>harbor from my cottage on the Island of Cobras, until we arrived at the mouth of Botafogo Bay, 
<li n=?>which we entered ; whilst paddhng round the bay and resigning myself to the control of spirit en- 
<li n=?>gendered by the fairy like appearance of the scene, I observed a white cross painted upon the rocks, 
<li n=?>which near the entrance of the bay, reach to the water's edge. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Having never before noticed it, I was considerably astonished at the sight, as these crosses are 
<li n=?>usually the "memento mori's" of some murder that has been committed on the spot where they are 
<li n=?>erected, and I could not believe that the hand of the assassin would have invaded a sanctuary like 
<li n=?>this. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>On inquiry, I gained from my companion, a venerable Brazilian, the following particulars, which 
<li n=?>I give you rendered into English, and stripped of numerous digressions on his part, during the nar- 
<li n=?>ration, which would most certainly not interest you, any more than I fear mine have. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In the year 18 — , the Martini palace which was located a short distance from Botafogo bay, in the 
<li n=?>direction of the city of Rio de Janeiro, was not more celebrated for its grandeur and magnificence, 
<li n=?>than for its owner, the Marquis Juan de Martini ; — cold, haughty, and reserved in his manners, he 
<li n=?>was liked by no one ; secluded almost altogether from the world, he appeared to feel no interest in 
<li n=?>any one around him, and but for one circumstance, the fact of his existence even would have been 
<li n=?>forgotten, so rarely did he appear in public. Like Jeptha, he had one fair daughter, and her he did 
<li n=?>indeed love passing well. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Isabel de Martini had long been celebrated as the fairest of the fair, in the imperial city of St. 
<li n=?>Sebastian; her dark eye beaming with intelhgence, was surmounted by a brow of perfect symmetry, 
<li n=?>and her raven locks playing loosely about her sculptured neck, gave her an almost elf-like appearance. 
<li n=?>Beauty cannot be described, and any description would fall short of what Isabel really was; let every 
<li n=?>one draw from his imagination for her image, for she was lovely as imagination can conceive ; would 
<li n=?>that I could do so, but although a worshipper of the fair daughters of Eve, almost to idolatry, I never 
<li n=?>yet could transfer their charms to paper : sirffice it then to say, that among all the dark eyed beauties 
<li n=?>of this sunny land, who stand unrivalled both for form, and face, Isabel de Martini shone pie- 
<li n=?>eminent. Many were the admirers, and among them many of the proudest nobles of Brazil, who 
<li n=?>had sued for the honor of her hand, and all in vain ; to all she turned an inattentive ear, and if the 
<li n=?>truth must be told, the fair Isabel was just the least in the world of a coquette, and however much 
<li n=?>her vanity might be flattered by seeing her train of admirers swelling with the noble and the rich, 
<li n=?>she passed along unmoved by any, " fancy free." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Pass over a year in the life of our heroine, and go with me to the shores of the bay I have de- 
<li n=?>scribed to you ; the moon was shining with its silvery light upon the still waters of the bay, which 
<li n=?>clearly as a mirror, reflected all around it, yet no object Was reflected half so fair as the forms of Isabel 
<li n=?>and a young man, who, with his arm around her, was gazing on his companion with an expression 
<li n=?>of the deepest afl'ection. Long they walked, and if we do not give you the subject of their conver- 
<li n=?>sation, it is for the two-fold reason, that being lovers, it was necessarily of a character uninteresting 
<li n=?>to a third person, and moreover, I did not hear a word of it; time flew, but still they strolled along 
<li n=?>the tranquil margin of ihe bay, and it was the lady who first observed the lateness of the hour, and 
<li n=?>spoke of returning. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Do not detain me longer," she said, " indeed, indeed, Fernando, I must leave you ; my absence 
<li n=?>will be remarked, and though for myself I care not, still your safety as much as my own, demands 
<li n=?>that we should be prudent ; indeed we must separate, but 'tis only till to-morrow." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Dearest Isabel," replied her lover, " how can I ever sufliciently repay you 1 you, the admired of 
<li n=?>all, the loveliest of your sex, thus to brave all for me — and must we part would that the time were 
<li n=?>come, when we will fly together far from this hated place, and secure from all pursuit, live only for 
<li n=?>each other." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Once more, then," said Isabel, "good night; for my sake, be careful of yourself, and remember 
<li n=?>that my existence is dependant upon yours. God bless you, good night." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The youth folded her in his arms, and hastily impressed a kiss upon her brow, which was of a 
<li n=?>marble paleness, and .then releasing her, the maiden disappeared among the rocks; he gazed after 
<li n=?>her for a few morirents, then casting off" the fastening of a canoe, which lay concealed in a small cove 
<li n=?>beneath, he sprang into it, and rapidly plying his paddle, in a very brief space he reached the op- 
<li n=?>posite shore, and disappeared. As the scene just described may appear a little strange to those whose 
<li n=?>patience has carried them thus far, it v;iil be proper to state the particulars of the acquaintance 
<li n=?>which had arisen between our heroine, and the evident object of her choice. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>At a public ball given by the Emperor, to which not only the nobility, but all the respectable in- 
<li n=?>habitants of Rio were admitted, the fair Isabel was as usual the cyrrosure of all admirirrg glances ; 
<li n=?>and while to all their flattering speeches she turned an inattentive ear, she was much struck with 
<li n=?>the appearance of a young stranger, who although not belonging to her own rank in life, was evident- 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>THEWHITECROSS. 25 </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>ly one of " nature's noblemen," and she secretly acknowledged to herself that had any of her previous 
<li n=?>admirers but resembled him, her heart had not been so difficult to subdue; — never had she ex- 
<li n=?>perienced such sensations as those which now possessed her, and she was pleased, although unable 
<li n=?>to define the cause, to observe that he was evidently gazing upon her with an eye of sincere admira- 
<li n=?>tion. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>He was the son of a captain in the Imperial Army, who had fallen in the service of his country, 
<li n=?>and had left his son wholly dependant upon his own exertions for support. Long had he gazed 
<li n=?>with admiration amounting to idolatry, upon the lovely Isabel, whom he had often seen in pubhc ; 
<li n=?>never before, however, had he been thrown so directly into the society of one, whom, he felt, to see 
<li n=?>was to love ; and now that he could at leisure gaze upon those charms, he resigned himself to the 
<li n=?>control of his passion, and with a thrill of transport, observed that his admiration was noticed, and 
<li n=?>was evidently not disagreeable to its object. The last person noticed by Isabel, on leaving the ball, 
<li n=?>was the stranger, whose eyes were still intently fixed upon her, and if a responsive glance fiom her 
<li n=?>met his eye, who shall blame her 1 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In this country, where intrigue is the chief business of life, but little difficulty occurred in his con- 
<li n=?>veying to his " lady love" the intelligence that he lived but for her; and it would be tedious to nar- 
<li n=?>rate the manner in which he obtained his first interview with her. The greatest difficulty which 
<li n=?>arose was lespecting the place of meeting, until chance disclosed to them a path leading through the 
<li n=?>mountains from the Martini palace to the bay ; there in the face of heaven, alone, the lovers met in 
<li n=?>the still hour of midnight, and with the resplendent moon, and all the heavenly •' isles of light" alone 
<li n=?>for witnesses, told their love, and spoke of future happiness. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Much difficulty attended their meetings, as it was necessary for Isabel to await the retiring of all 
<li n=?>the family, before she could leave her chamber, which she was enabled to do by means of a private 
<li n=?>door, communicating with the garden. Anxiously would she remain in the solitude of her apart- 
<li n=?>ment, until the entire cessation of noise within the house, bade her fly to her appointment ; then in 
<li n=?>her lover's arms, with no thought for aught on earth save him, in whom were centred all the resist- 
<li n=?>less feelings of her heart, would she be for a time completely happy ; as few will deny, that the en- 
<li n=?>joyments (and especially those of this description,) of which we partake by stealth, are more intense 
<li n=?>than those which we possess sanctioned by all around us. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Thus had they met in secret, for several months, and now only awaited the sailing of a vessel, 
<li n=?>whose captain (convinced of the propriety thereof, by the argument of a well filled purse) had con- 
<li n=?>sented to receive them on board, and carry them to some far distant land, where secure from oppo- 
<li n=?>sition, and revenge, they might be happy in each other. But I am delaying the catastrophe too long, 
<li n=?>and will forthwith proceed to the denouement. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>To enable Isabel to carry into efifect her plans for meeting her lover, it had been necessary for 
<li n=?>her to make a confidante of a servant, whom she believed to be devotedly attached to her ; avarice, 
<li n=?>however, reigned triumphant in her soul, and she betrayed the secret to her mistress' father, for a 
<li n=?>sum of money. His rage at learning the disgrace thus brought upon his house, for as such he con- 
<li n=?>sidered it, cannot be described. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>I felt, but cannot paint his rage, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>If. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>He determined at once upon a terrible revenge ; that he might be certain of the fact, he had fol- 
<li n=?>lowed Isabel on this, their last night of meeting, and unseen, had been a witness of the lover's in- 
<li n=?>terview; he could scarcely restrain himself from at once rushing upon, and destroying the devoted 
<li n=?>lover, but he did so, and returned to his palace with the fixed resolve, that this meeting should be 
<li n=?>their last. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>On the following night, he took measures to detain his daughter in conversation for an hour be- 
<li n=?>yond the appointed time, and several of his servants were stationed at the place of meeting with 
<li n=?>orders to assassinate the unfortunate object of his wrath, on his arrival. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>At the appointed hour, Fernando hastened on the wings of love, to meet his mistress ; another 
<li n=?>night of beauty seemed to hallow his intent : nature was at rest, and the bright moon shone . coldly 
<li n=?>down, only to light him to his death ; with a light heart he entered his canoe, crossed the bay, and 
<li n=?>arrived on the opposite shore ; before he had time to notice and wonder at the absence of his mistress, 
<li n=?>the assassins' daggers were in his heart ; he died with her name upon his lips, and leaving him where 
<li n=?>he fell, the murderers fled. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The moment that Isabel could disengage herself from her father, she humed to her room, and re- 
<li n=?>gardless of her former caution, flew to her appointment; her father watched, and at a distance fol- 
<li n=?>lowed her ; she soon reached the spot, and oh ! what a sight of horror met her eye ! hei lover, whom 
<li n=?>she last saw in all the radiant pride of beauty and of youth, now lay dead before her, pierced with 
<li n=?>many wounds, and covered with his blood ; she threw herself frantically beside him, hoping that 
<li n=?>some spaik of life might still be unextinguished. Such hopes, however, were in vain ; and as the 
<li n=?>thought flashed upon her that she had been betrayed, she gave herself up entirely to the horror and 
<li n=?>anguish of the moment ; it was but for an instant, however, for rising rapidly, she rushed with a 
<li n=?>frantic scream to the water's edge, and throwing herself into the depths beneath, which possessed no 
<li n=?>terrors for her, she sank to rise no more.

<li n=?>was too late, he arrived but in time to see her sink beneath the wave. 
</p>

<li n=?>The waters wild, went o'er his child

<p>
<li n=?>There lies in the north of England a considerable tract of land, now known by the name of the 
<li n=?>Waste Lands, which once formed the richest property of two wealthy families by whom untoward 
<li n=?>circumstances had caused it to be deserted. For some time, it was looked after by stewards, too much 
<li n=?>bent upon profiting themselves to regard the interests of their employers. The tenantry, who, drain- 
<li n=?>ed of their hard earnings, were obliged to vex the land till it became a bed of stones, dropped off one 
<li n=?>by one. The hedge-rows, being unremittingly assisted in the progress of decay by the paupers of 
<li n=?>the neighborhood, were soon reduced to nothing but dock-weeds and brambles ; which gradually 
<li n=?>uniting from the opposite ends of the fields, the property became a huge thicket, too encumbered 
<li n=?>ever to be worth clearing, and only valuable to poachers and gypsies, to whom it still affords abundant 
<li n=?>booty and a secure hiding place. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The two mansions have kept pace in ruin with the lands around them. The persons left in charge 
<li n=?>of them, being subject to no supervision, put themselves but little out of their way to preserve that 
<li n=?>which was so lightly regarded by the owners. Too careless to repair the dilapidations of time and 
<li n=?>the weather, they were driven, by broken windows and rickety doors, from office to office, and from 
<li n=?>parlor to parlor, till ruin fairly pursued them into the grand saloon ; where the Turkey carpets were 
<li n=?>tattered by hob-nails, and the dogs of the chase licked their paws upon sofas of silk and satin. In due 
<li n=?>time, the rain forced its way through the roofs, and the occupiers having no orders to stop it with a 
<li n=?>tile, the breach became wider and wider. Soon the fine papering began to show discolored patches, 
<li n=?>and display the lath and plaster which bulged through it ; then the nails which supported the family 
<li n=?>portraits gave way with their burthens; and finally, the rafters began to yield, and the inhabitants 
<li n=?>wisely vacated the premises in time to avoid the last crash, rightly conjecturing that it was useless 
<li n=?>to leave the moveables behind to share in the common destruction, when there was so little likelihood 
<li n=?>of their ever being inquired after. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Thus ended the pride both of HeronclifT and Hazledell, which may still be seen, from each other, 
<li n=?>about a mile apart, shooting up a few parti-colored walls from their untrimmed wildernesses, and 
<li n=?>seeming, like two desperate combatants, to stand to the last extremity; neither of them cheered by a 
<li n=?>sign of Ufe, excepting the jackdaws which sit perched upon the dead tips of the old ash trees, and 
<li n=?>the starlings that sweep around at sunset in circles, within which the country folks have rarely been 
<li n=?>hardy enough to intrude. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The last possessor who resided at Hazledell was an eccentric old bachelor, with a disposition so 
<li n=?>composed of kindness and petulance, that every body liked, and scarcely any one could live with him. 
<li n=?>His relations had been driven away from him, one after the other ; — one because he presumed to 
<li n=?>plead the poverty of a tenant whom the old man had previously resolved upon forgiving his rent ; 
<li n=?>another, because he reserved the choice bin of the cellar when wine was prescribed for the sickness 
<li n=?>of the poor; and a third, because he suffered himself to be convinced in politics, and destroyed a fair 
<li n=?>subject for arguments which were intended to afford time to his company for discussing their good 
<li n=?>cheer. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>There was but one person who understood him, and this was his nephew; who continued to the 
<li n=?>last his only companion, and kept him alive solely by knowing how to manage him. He had the 
<li n=?>good taste never to remind him of his years by approaching him with that awe which is commonly 
<li n=?>demonstrated by young people towards the old ; and the tact to observe exactly where his foibles 
<li n=?>would bear raillery, and where they required sympathy. He could lead him from one mood to another,

<p>
<li n=?>so thai the longest day in his company never seemed monotonous ; oi if he rambled away amongst 
<li n=?>the neighborhood, he could return at night with a tale of adventures which sent him to bed without 
<li n=?>repining at the prospect of to-mwrow. Unluckily the old man considered him too necessary to his 
<li n=?>comforts to part with him ; and though merely the son of a younger brother, without fortune or ex- 
<li n=?>pectations, he was not permitted to turn his mind to a profession, or to any thing beyond the present. 
<li n=?>The youth, however, was scarcely twenty -three ; and at such an age, a well-supplied purse for the 
<li n=?>time being leaves but little anxiety for the future. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>With a good education, picked up as he could by snatches, a sprightly disposition, and a talent 
<li n=?>equal to any thing, young Vibert of Hazledell was as welcome abroad as he was at home; and it 
<li n=?>■was argued that his handsome figure and countenance would stand him in the stead of the best pro- 
<li n=?>fession going. The young ladies would turn from any beau at the country-ball to greet his arrival, 
<li n=?>and never think of engaging themselves to dance till they were quite sure that he was disposed of. 
<li n=?>One remarked upon the blackness of his hair, another upon the whiteness of his forehead; and the 
<li n=?>squires who weie not jealous of him would entertain them with his feats of horsemanship and adroit- 
<li n=?>ness at bringing down, right and left. Still Vibert was not spoiled ; and the young ladies pulled up 
<li n=?>their kid gloves till they split, v^'ithout making any visible impression upon him. His obstinacy was 
<li n=?>quite incomprehensible. Each ridiculed the disappointment of her friend, in the hope of concealing 
<li n=?>her own ; and all turned for consolation to the young master of Heroncliff. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marcus of Heroncliif, was nearly of an age with Vibert, and was perhaps still more popular with 
<li n=?>the heads of families, if not with the younger branches ; for he had the advantage of an ample fortune. 
<li n=?>His person, also, was well formed, and his features were, for the most part, handsome ; but the first 
<li n=?>had none of the grace of Vibert, and the last had a far different expression. His front, instead of 
<li n=?>being cast in that fine expansive mould, was contracted and low, and denoted more cunning than 
<li n=?>talent. His eye was too deeply sunk to indicate openness or generosity ; and the tout ensemble gave 
<li n=?>an idea of sulkiness and double-dealing. It was held by many that his outward appearance was not 
<li n=?>a fair index of his disposition, which was said to be liberal and good-natured. The only fault which 
<li n=?>they found with him was, that his conversation seemed over-much guarded for one of his age. He 
<li n=?>appeared unwilling to show himself as he really was, and the greatest confidence which could be re- 
<li n=?>posed in him produced no corresponding return. He walked in society like one who came to look 
<li n=?>on rather than mix in it ; and although his dependants lived in profusion, his table was rarely en- 
<li n=?>livened save by the dogs which had been the companions of his sport. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Vibert, whose character it was to judge always favorably, believed that his manner and mode of 
<li n=?>life proceeded from the consciousness of a faulty education, and a mistrust of his capacity to redeem 
<li n=?>lost time. He felt a friendliness for him, bordering upon compassion ; and their near neighborhood 
<li n=?>affording him frequent opportunities of throwing himself in his way, a considerable degree of intimacy 
<li n=?>was, in course of time, established between them. Vibert was right, as far as he went, in his esti- 
<li n=?>mate of his friend's mind ; but he never detected its grand feature. Marcus was sensible that he was 
<li n=?>below par amongst those of his rank, and a proud heart made him bitterly jealous of all who had the 
<li n=?>advantage of him. It was this that gave verity to the expression which we have before noticed in 
<li n=?>his features; made him a torment to himself; and rendered him incapable of sympathising with 
<li n=?>others. If a word were addressed to him, he believed that it was designed to afford an opportunity 
<li n=?>of ridiculing his reply; if he chanced to be contradicted, his visage blackened as though he felt that 
<li n=?>he had been insulted. Vibert, so open to examination, was the only person whom he did not suspect 
<li n=?>and dread. They hunted, shot, -and went into society together ; and it was observed that Marcus lost 
<li n=?>nothing by the contact. His confidence increased, his reserve in some degree disappeared, and 
<li n=?>Vibert secretly congratulated himself on having fashioned a battery to receive the flattering attentions 
<li n=?>from which he was anxious to escape. His ambition, indeed, was otherwise directed. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>At a few miles' distance from Hazledell was a pretty estate, called Silvermere, from a small lake, 
<li n=?>■which reflected the front of the dwelling and the high grounds and rich timber behind it. It was 
<li n=?>inhabited by persons of consideration in the county, who were too happy at home to mix much with 
<li n=?>their neighbors. In fact, of a numerous family, there was but one daughter old enough to be in- 
<li n=?>troduced; and she was of a beauty so rare, that theie was little danger in keeping her upon hand 
<li n=?>until her sister was of an age to accompany hei into society. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In this family, Vibert had been for some time a favorite, and had been fascinated on his first in- 
<li n=?>troduction to it. The beauty of whom we have made mention, and her sister, a year or two younger, 
<li n=?>■were placed on either side of him ; and it was hard to know whether most to admire the wild tongue 
<li n=?>and laughing loveliness of the younger — the fair-haired Edith ; or the retiring, but attractive dignity 
<li n=?>of the black eyes and pale fine features of the elder — the graceful Marion. They were, perhaps, both 
<li n=?>pleased to see the hero of the county conversations , but the younger one was the foremost to display 
<li n=?>it ; without being a flirt, she was frank, and had the rare, natural gift of saying and doing what she 
<li n=?>pleased without danger of misconstruction. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The daring but femmine gaiety of this young creature speedily dispelled from the mind of Vibert 
<li n=?>all idea of his recent acquaintance. On his showing any recollection of it, she assured him that, on 
<li n=?>her part, the acquaintance was by no means recent, for she had heard him discussed as often as any 
<li n=?>Knight of the Round Table.

<li n=?>and you can judge v.'hcthcr, at any future time, when your horse happens to knock up in our 
<li n=?>neighborhood, and your dinner to be five miles off, you will condescend to take advantage of us. 
<li n=?>Papa and mamma, who you see have been a handsome couple, and would think themselves so still 
<li n=?>if they had not such a well grown family, are by no means rigid, exacting, fault-finding, and dis- 
<li n=?>agreeable, like papas and ■mammas in general. They have had the good taste to discover our precose 
<li n=?>talents, and profit by being our companions instead of our rulers, from the time we learned the art 
<li n=?>of spelling words of one syllable, and doing as we were not bidden. Instead of scolding us for our 
<li n=?>misdeeds, they used to reason with us as to their propriety, and generally got the worst of the argu- 
<li n=?>ment ; so, saving that in virtue of our old companionship we make them the confidants of most of 
<li n=?>our dilemmas, they have brought us up charmingly undutiful and self-willed. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"As for Marion, she is a young lady erroneously supposed to be the pride of the family, who pre- 
<li n=?>sumes to regard me with a patronising complacency, and to encourage me in the idea that, one of 
<li n=?>these days, I shall really learn to talk. She is a sedate personage, who tries to reflect upon things ; 
<li n=?>but, as the same deep study has shaded her brow as long as I can recollect, I imagine that she does 
<li n=?>not often come to a conclusion. Yet the falsely-styled pride of Silvermere does not blanch her cheeks 
<li n=?>in the unwholesome atmosphere of learned tomes ; nor by spinning the globes, nor by hunting the 
<li n=?>stars. Her character is a little touched with romance, and her study is how to mend a bad world, 
<li n=?>which continues aihng in spite of her. She gives all her consolation, and half of her pin-money, to 
<li n=?>a tribe of old dames and young damsels, who, under such patronage, only pull our hedges in greater 
<li n=?>security, or add fiesh colors to the costume which is to flaunt triumphant on the fair day. The 
<li n=?>urchins whom she teaches ' to guess their lessons,' and buys off from aiding in the toils of their 
<li n=?>parents, are the most mischievous in the neighborhood ; and, in short, things go on worse and worse, 
<li n=?>and poor Marion does not know what to make of it. From the humbler world, so different from the 
<li n=?>Arcadian affair of her imagination, she turns with despair to the sphere in which she is herself to 
<li n=?>move, and shudders at the prospect of disappointment there also. Where, amongst such a community 
<li n=?>of young ladies battling for precedence, and young gentlemen vowing eternal constancy to a dozen 
<li n=?>at a time, can she look for the friend of her soul, or the more favored being who is to console her for 
<li n=?>the want of one 1 Alas, the pride of Silvermere ! with feelings so delicate that a gossamer might 
<li n=?>wound them, how can she accommodate herself to any world but that of the fairy tales which de- 
<li n=?>lighted our nursery, or expect tranquility in any place but a cloister" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Vibert's calls were repeated often, each one affording a pretext for another, and each visit growing 
<li n=?>longer than the last. The father of his two attractions was required frequently by his affairs in 
<li n=?>London, where he spent weeks at a time, and their mother was generally confined by delicate health 
<li n=?>to her chamber. Thus Vibert's intimacy with them had but little ceremony to restrain its rapid 
<li n=?>advancement ; and he soon felt, what has perhaps been felt by many, that the simple smile of the 
<li n=?>dignified and retiring is more perilous than the brightest glance of wit and vivacity. Indeed, Edith 
<li n=?>was too gay to be suspected of any thought beyond that of amusement ; but the actions of Marion 
<li n=?>were more measured, and her approbation was the more flattering. Vibert laughed when he en- 
<li n=?>countered the first; but his pulse beat quicker at the sight of the last. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>There seems in the affairs of the heart to be an unaccountable intelligence, by which, without the 
<li n=?>use of external signs, the tremors of the one generally find their reverberation in the other. Often 
<li n=?>as Vibert entered to share in the morning amusements of the sisters, to give an account of the horse 
<li n=?>that he was breaking in for Marion, or the dog that he was teaching antics for Edith, it was im- 
<li n=?>possible for him to be insensible to an increasing flush of satisfaction at his appearance, and by de- 
<li n=?>grees he gave up all other society, and had no pastime to which Marion was not a party. Both 
<li n=?>young, both interested in the other's happiness, it was not likely that they should reflect how the 
<li n=?>brightest flowers may be the seat of poison, and the sweetest moments the parents of miser'. Their 
<li n=?>intimacy became more confidential ; and Edith left them more and more to themselves to seek 
<li n=?>amusement elsewhere. Still theie was no question of love. Vibert knew that, without fortune or 
<li n=?>expectations, he could have no jKetension to Marion : and that the number of her young brothers and 
<li n=?>sisters must render it impossible for her father to remedy the deficiency. It was then that he felt the 
<li n=?>extent of the sacrifice he had made in devoting himself so entirely to his uncle. Had he adopted any 
<li n=?>profession, he might have obtained a home of his own, to say the least ; and, however humble that 
<li n=?>home might have been, would Marion have shrunk from it 1 Would Marion have failed to make it 
<li n=?>the richest spot upon earth 1 He was yet only of an age when many commence their career ; his 
<li n=?>mind was too active and too brilliant to suffer his habits to become ao fixed but that he could turn 
<li n=?>them to any thing. He determined upon breaking the matter to his uncle; and, as Edith was now 
<li n=?>eighteen, and the sisters were just about to appear in public, there was no time to be lost. If Marion 
<li n=?>were not to go forth with a hand already engaged, what had he not to apprehend! Fortune and 
<li n=?>honors would be at her feet — friends would reason — parents might command — and what had she to 
<li n=?>reply 1 She loved an idler who lived upon another's bounty, and whose future means were some- 
<li n=?>thing worse than precarious ! He seized upon what he thought a good opportunity, the same 
<li n=?>evening. His uncle was enjoying his arm-chair and slippers beside an ample fire, to which the pat- 
<li n=?>tering of a November storm gave additional comfort.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<li n=?>she were to be the mistress of an establishment of her own." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>« We can remedy that, too, Vibert. Divide the house with me at the middle of the cellar, and 
<li n=?>brick up the communications. Divide the stables and the horses ; have new wheels and new arms 
<li n=?>to the old family rumble-tumble, and make any farther arrangements you please. You have been a 
<li n=?>good boy, to bear with a crazy old man so long, and I should not like you to be a loser by it." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" My dear uncle, there was no need of this additional generosity to secure my gratitude, and my 
<li n=?>endeavors to prove it. I did not speak for the purpose of placing any farther tax upon you, but merely 
<li n=?>to consult you whether it were not better that I thought of some profession, by which I might attain 
<li n=?>a position in Ufe not liable to reverse." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"A profession! — what, one that would call you away from HazledelH" 
</p>
<p>

<li n=?>away the only crutch that props me up from the grave — bequeath me to the mercy of hired servants, 
<li n=?>with not a soul to exchange a word of comfort with me ! What fortune could you obtain which 
<li n=?>would compensate for reflections like these 1 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Stay, nephew, and see me into my grave — the reverse which you apprehend — I never thought 
<li n=?>that you could so coldly contemplate my extinction ; but it is right and natural that you should do 
<li n=?>so. Only stay — and I promise you that I will not keep you long — I will curtail my expenses, banish 
<li n=?>my few old friends, dismiss my servants, and live upon bread and water, to save what I can for you 
<li n=?>from the estate. I cannot cause it to descend to you ; but, at all events, I can save you as much as 
<li n=?>you would be likely to make by leaving me. Yet, if it be your wish to go, even go ; I had rather 
<li n=?>you would leave me miserable, than stay to wish me dead." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The old man had worked himself into a fit of childish agitation, and Vibert saw that argument 
<li n=?>Avas useless. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Uncle," he replied, with a look and voice of despair, " make yourself easy, Marion will find 
<li n=?>another husband, who will perhaps render her happier than I could, and I will remain with you as 
<li n=?>I have done hitherto." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>From this time, Vibert spared no effort to overcome his ill-starred passion, as well for Marion's 
<li n=?>sake as for his own ; seeking every possible pretext to render his visits less frequent, and to pay them 
<li n=?>in company. Marion perceived the change at the moment it took place, and, although she could 
<li n=?>not dispute its propriety, her sensibility was v/ounded to the quick. She commenced her first round 
<li n=?>of provincial gaiety with a fever at her heart, and an ominous presage of sorrow. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The appearance of the Silvermere party formed an epoch in the annals of the county — and, as 
<li n=?>Vibert had forseen, there was not a squire of the smallest pretensions who did not address himself 
<li n=?>sedulously to make th** agreeable to them. They had little encouragement, however, in their at- 
<li n=?>tempts, excepting from Edith. Her heart was free, and her tongue was full of joy ; but Marion was 
<li n=?>looking for the return of Vibert; and the reserved glance of her eye kept flattery at a distance, and 
<li n=?>hope in fetters. Still he returned not — she never met him in society, but she constantly heard of 
<li n=?>his having been at balls and merry-maldngs where she was not. It was in the vain pursuit of his 
<li n=?>peace of mind ; and she was too generous to attribute it to any thing else. On his occasional visits 
<li n=?>of ceremony she received him as if nothing material had happened ; but the flush was gone from her 
<li n=?>cheek, and the smile that remained was cold and sickly. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Meantime, rumor was liberal in assigning to each of the sisters her share of intended husbands, 
<li n=?>Vibert listened to the catalogue with all the trepidation of a lover who had really entertained hopes, 
<li n=?>Alas ! if that selfish principle of denying to another what we cannot enjoy ourselves be excusable in 
<li n=?>any case it is so in love. The loved object which belongs to no other still appears to be in some de- 
<li n=?>gree our own ; and fancy conjures up, in spite of us, an indefinable trust in the future, of which the 
<li n=?>total destruction falls like the blow of an assassin. It was thus with Vibert, when, after writhing 
<li n=?>long in secret anguish at the mention of any name connected with that of Marion, report from all 
<li n=?>quarters concurred in the same uncontradicted tale. Marion was receiving the addresses of Marcus 
<li n=?>of Heroncliff : of him, for whom he had himself, from motives of the purest kindness, secured the 
<li n=?>good thoughts of her family — him whom he had made the confidant of his love — him who had pro- 
<li n=?>fessed himself to be only waiting for encouragement to throw himself at the feet of her sister ! That 
<li n=?>he should have met him daily, and never hinted at the change in his intentions ! Yet might it not 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>THE WASTE LANDS. 31 </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>have been that he feared to inflict piin 1 Tiiat he should have deserted Edith when his conduct 
<li n=?>had imphed all that was devoted ! Yet, was it not for Marion 1 But then, that Marion should have 
<li n=?>become the rival of her sister ! Yet, oh ! how soon she had overcome the remembrance of him, and 
<li n=?>how natural was it for the cold in love to become the faithless in friendship. Thus Vihert went on 
<li n=?>arguing for and against all the parties, and winding up with a forced ejaculation of — " It is nothing' 
<li n=?>to me — it is no atTair of mine." It was meant to confirm his pride, but only proved his wretched 
<li n=?>ness. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Upon this principle, and from a sense of his want of self-possession, the name of Marion nevet 
<li n=?>passed his lips in the presence of Marcus, who, on his part, was equally silent. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The report upon which this conduct was adopted was not so destitute of reason as those which 
<li n=?>had preceded it. Marcus, with the failing already noticed, was incapable of being a true friend ; 
<li n=?>and, though at his first introduction at iSilvermere, the marked intelligence between Marion and 
<li n=?>Vibert reduced him to the necessity of devoting his attentions to Edith, yet the circumstance of her 
<li n=?>sister's preference for another was sufhcient to kindle in his heart the most burning anxiety to obtain 
<li n=?>her for himself. "Without considering Vibert's earlier acquaintance, he felt himself eclipsed, and his 
<li n=?>honor wounded. The moment, therefore, that his friend's visits were discontinued, his own were 
<li n=?>redoubled. They were naturally, from his previous behavior, laid by the family to the account of 
<li n=?>Edith; and, upon this conviction, Marion often used him as a protection against the advances of her 
<li n=?>unwelcome host of admirers. If she was asked to dance, she was engaged to Marcus ; and his arm 
<li n=?>was always ready to conduct her to her carriage. It was observed that she received much more of 
<li n=?>his attention than was bestowed upon her sister; and insensibly their manner in public became the 
<li n=?>practice in private, where there was no need for it. His hopes rose high, and he scrupled not to 
<li n=?>advance them by endeavoring to extirpate the last kind feeling which he thought might yet linger 
<li n=?>for poor Vibert. One while he affected chagrin, and invented excesses on the part of his friend as 
<li n=?>the cause of it : at another time he was incensed at injurious words, which he alleged to have been 
<li n=?>employed by Vibert towards heiself. At last, when he thought himself quite secure, he disclosed his 
<li n=?>passion, and was rejected with astonishment. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The sting, for one like him, had a thousand barbs : he loved the beautiful Marion with all the 
<li n=?>energy of a soul which had never before loved a human being. Common report, and his confidence 
<li n=?>in her resentment against Vibert, had made him consider her as already his own. His triumph over 
<li n=?>all the competitors that he had feared, envied, and detested, was, as he deemed, on the eve of com- 
<li n=?>pletion ; and now he was to be the object of derision and mock pity ! The means which he had 
<li n=?>used to ingratiate himself would probably be divulged. The inmost core of his heart would be ex- 
<li n=?>posed and scorned ; and Vibert, whom he felt to be the latent cause of his rejection, was, perhaps, 
<li n=?>finally to be reinstated, and to flaunt his triumph daily before his eyes ! The very evils which bad 
<li n=?>minds have attempted to inflict upon others, become a provocation to themselves: they have been de- 
<li n=?>feated, and therefore they have been injured ; and the rejected suitor returned home pallid and quiver- 
<li n=?>ing with an ague fit of mortal hate. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The attentions of Marcus had never been discussed between the sisters until the occurrence of this 
<li n=?>'catastrophe. He left them in a shaded alley of the pleasure-grounds, which were beginning to be 
<li n=?>strewed with the yellow leaves of autumn ; and a clouded sunset cast a few long streaks across the 
<li n=?>sward, and made the deep recesses look still more sombre. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>There are few who do not feel a melancholy peculiar to this period of the year. Marion had a 
<li n=?>double reason; for it Avas about the same time in the preceding autumn, and in the summer-house 
<li n=?>but a few steps before her that she had passed the last happy hour with Vibert ! 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Marion," said Edith, as they walked on, with their arms fondly resting upon each other's neck, 
<li n=?>" you are not well. It is long since you were well ; but I had hoped that the attachment of Marcus 
<li n=?>would have dispelled a deep grief, of which you forbade me ever to speak. I trusted that your heart 
<li n=?>had been arrested in its progress of sorrow, and I was silent, lest you should think me jealous of my 
<li n=?>sweet rival." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Heavens ! that my apathy should have been so great as to mistake his intentions. I only bore 
<li n=?>with him because I thought him yours." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Marion, I never should have wished him loved by yoii, had I not felt that your life depended on 
<li n=?>the diversion of your thoughts. I have been mistaken ; you have been dying daily, and, unless you 
<li n=?>would have me die with you, let me write to Vibert. Sweet Marion, let me write, as from myself, 
<li n=?>in my own wild way, merely to bid him come and dance on my birthday." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"No, Edith, no. He would suspect the reason; it is too humihating. I have still pride enough 
<li n=?>left to save me from contempt, if not to support me from Edith, let us talk of other things." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>She leaned her head upon her sister's bosom, and both were weeping, when they were startled by 
<li n=?>the gallop of a horse, and a ring at the garden gate. Edith saw that it was the servant of Vibert, 
<li n=?>and she sprang hke a fawn to inquire his commission. He brought a letter for Marion, and thus it 
<li n=?>ran: 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The relations who stood between me and the succession to the estates of Hazledell are deaa. I 
<li n=?>am now my uncle's heir; but I fear too late. The sorrow of withdrawing myself to my proper dis 
<li n=?>tance when I was poor is probably to be followed up by the anguish of being forbidden to return now

<li n=?>with Marcus — till you bid me look forward to a termination of the misery which a feeling of honor 
<li n=?>&lt;2'bliged me to inflict upon myself." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marion sank for support against the ivy-twined pillar of the summer house. Edith kissed her pale 
<li n=?>«heek, and fondly whispered, " I told you so : what answer will you sendl" After the first moments 
<li n=?>of tremulous agitation — after an interval of silence, to lull the tumults of her heart, Marion merely 
<li n=?>ejaculated, " Poor Vibert ! I thought he had forgotten me !" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"Bather say, poor Edith," replied her sister, with a burst of that natural gaiety which had of late 
<li n=?>almost forsaken her ; " poor Edith has now the willow-wreath all to herself. Alas ! for some 
<li n=?>doughty champion to twine it round the neck of the false lord of HeronclifT! 
<li n=?>" Here — here is a pencil — the servant waits for a reply." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marion tore the back from her letter, and wrote — " The reports are unfounded — the future is in 
<li n=?>3':our power." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Edith !" she said, when the messenger was dismissed, " give me your arm back to the house, for 
<li n=?>I feel faint. In the midst of all this happiness, there is a sickness at my heart — a strange boding, 
<li n=?>that I am only tantalized by chimeras, and meant for misfortune. Perhaps I deceive myself. Per- 
<li n=?>haps it is only the strange bewilderment occasioned by this revolution in all that interests me. I can- 
<li n=?>not help it." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was a gusty and querulous night. The old trees by their window groaned as though they were 
<li n=?>ia trouble, and the scud swept along the sky like a host of spectres, Marion's distressing fancies 
<li n=?>were not to be calmed, and grew even more excited by the restless and apparently preternatural 
<li n=?>spirits of her sister, who discussed their prospects in her wildest vein. She arranged that when 
<li n=?>Marien became the lady of Hazledell, she also was to call it her home, make herself the sole object 
<li n=?>of attraction and tournament to all the squires round about, and display her true dignity by remain- 
<li n=?>ing a scornful lady and a respectable maiden aunt. By degrees, her fancy ceased castle-building — 
<li n=?>■a few unconnected sparks of vanity grew fainter and fainter, and she dropped asleep. Marion had 
<li n=?>no wish or power to repose; her nervous sense of apprehension continued to increase; she tried 
<li n=?>every effort to direct her thoughts toother subjects, but they invariably became entangled, and again 
<li n=?>pressed with a dead weight upon her heart. In this mood she v/as startled by Edith laughing in her 
<li n=?>sleep, with a sound which terrified her. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Edith !" she cried, shaking her till she partially awoke ; " Edith — you frighten me — why do you 
<li n=?>laugh in your sleep V 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I laughed," replied Edith, drowsily, and scarce knowing what she said, "I laughed at some one 
<li n=?>who preached to me of the vanity of human expectations." She again muttered a laugh, and a second 
<li n=?>iime diopped asleep. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Notwithstanding the note of Marion, the night at Hazledell had seemed to bring with it a sense 
<li n=?>■of sadness, no less than it had done at Silvermere. Vibert's uncle had retired to rest with an ominous 
<li n=?>feeling of distress at the news of his deceased relations. After a while he had come back to shake 
<li n=?>hands with him again. The young ones, he said, were dropping about him, and leaving him desolate 
<li n=?>to lament the luckless humors which had impeded him from adding to their comforts as he might 
<li n=?>have done. Every joint of him trembled lest he should live too long. " God bless you, Vibert !" 
<li n=?>he added, " you have always been a good boy, and have borne kindly with my infirmities — God bless 
<li n=?>you ! God bless you ! Vibert, you will go to-morrow to Silvermere  I have long prevented you 
<li n=?>from being happy, and you owe me no thanks that you arc so at last. Go to bed — you have grown 
<li n=?>thin from want of sleep ; and it is all my fault." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>He quitted him again with affectionate and almost childish reluctance ; and Vibert paced his room, 
<li n=?>in a fever of anticipation, till the rising of the sun, which had seemed as if it never meant to rise 
<li n=?>again. It was still too early to set out for Silvermere, but he knew that Marcus rose with the dawn 
<li n=?>for his field-sports, and his generous mind was unwilling to lose an instant in acknowledging and 
<li n=?>asking pardon for the suspicions which he had entertained of his friendship. He walked rapidly to 
<li n=?>Heroncliff, and found Marcus, as he had anticipated, up and dressed; in fact, he had passed the night 
<li n=?>■in the same manner as he himself had done, and his face looked haggard and wild. 
<li n=?>-" Marcus," said Vibert, " I come to tell you a piece of strange news " 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>■■"J know it already," replied Marcus, with an attempt to look glad. " I met your servant going to 
<li n=?>'^SilvfiTOiere with it. Your uncles in India are dead." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I scarcely recollect them, and it would therefore be ridiculous to affect much grief for their loss; 
<li n=?>but the circumstance has been the means of showing me an injustice committed against yourself, at 
<li n=?>which I am sincerely grieved. I believed that you entertained an intention of supplanting me in the 
<li n=?>love of Marion; and although my reason had nothing to object to it, my heart felt that it was not 
<li n=?>the part which I would have acted towards you. I have accused you bitterly; but see, Marion has 
<li n=?>herself exculpated you ; and you must even forgive me as one who has been too unhappily bewilder- 
<li n=?>ed to be master of himself." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marcus took his offered hand and laughed, but with a fearful expression, which he strove to hide 
<li n=?>casting his eyes on the ground. 
<li n=?>-&lt;' Then Marion," he observed, " looks forward to being the lad' of Hazledell 1"

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marcus drew in his breath with a harrowing sound. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Vibert," he said, " we had best remain unmarried ; we are more independent to pursue our 
<li n=?>pastimes : we are not obliged to receive the society which is odious to us ; and, whilst we are free, 
<li n=?>we are the more welcomed abroad. Promise me you will think no more of it." 
<li n=?>■ " You would not ask it, if you felt, like me, that you were beloved by Marion. What do I care 
<li n=?>for independence and my reception abroad, when I have such a thraldom and such a paradise at 
<li n=?>home !" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" You are determined, then ■" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Can you doubt it 1 I am even now on my way to Silvermere. I should arrive too soon on 
<li n=?>horseback, and am therefore obliged to walk, for I cannot be easy till I find myself on my way 
<li n=?>thither. Come, take your gun, and accompany me." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I will accompany, in the hope of dissuading you, and bringing you back before you arrive there." 
<li n=?>" And I will drag you into fetters whether you will or not. Come ; it is time (o start, if we would 
<li n=?>be there by breakfast-time. What ails you 1 You look pale and shivering, this morning ; and see, 
<li n=?>for the first lime in your life, you have forgotten your gun." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>With that he kindly took it from where it stood, and presented it to him. 
<li n=?>" I will not take it," said Marcus, vaguely ; " I am nervous, and cannot shoot." 
<li n=?>" Tut, man ; take your gmi, I say ; a good shot will put you in spirits. There is an outlying deer 
<li n=?>from Hazledell in the Black Valley, and you must kill him for our wedding feast." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marcus bit his white lips, and did as he was bidden ; and the companions set out upon their walk. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The weather was still gusty and uncertain. The faint gleam of the sun was rapidly traversed by 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>the clouds, which seemed to overrun each other, in wild and fearful confusion. Several large trees 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>■were blown across the pathways, and the crows skimmed aloft in unsettled course, as though they 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>were afraid to perch. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" How I love this bracing air !" said Vibert. " I feel as if I could fly." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" You feel elastic from your errand. I have no such cause, and I would fain that the morning had 
<li n=?>been calmer. I think that long usage to blustering weather would have a strong effect upon men's 
<li n=?>passions, and render them too daring and reckless." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>As they descended the brow of fern and scattered plantations, from his bleak residence, his per- 
<li n=?>suasions that Vibert would return became more and more urgent. He used, in a wild, disjointed 
<li n=?>manner, all the vain arguments to which the selfish and the dissipated generally resort to dissuade 
<li n=?>their friends from what they call a sacrifice of liberty. They were easily overruled, and his agitation 
<li n=?>grew the more violent. In this manner they arrived at the entrance of the Black Valley, a gorge of 
<li n=?>rock, and varied earth, choked up by trees and bushes, chance-sown, by the birds and the winds. 
<li n=?>This valley was between two and three miles in length, its gloom was unbroken by a single habita- 
<li n=?>tion, and it had been the witness of many atrocities. It was a place usually avoided; but it was the 
<li n=?>shortest road to Silvermere, and Vibert never visited it by any other. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I do not like this valley !" said Marcus ; " we will take the upper road." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" It is too far about — come on — you are not yourself this morning, and the sooner Edith laughs at 
<li n=?>you the better." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>They were making a short cut through the tangled thicket, from one path to another, and had 
<li n=?>reached a more gloomy and savage spot than they had hitherto encountered. Marcus sat down upon 
<li n=?>a piece of splintered timber, and motioned Vibert, with a gasping earnestness which was not to be 
<li n=?>disputed, to seat himself beside him. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Marcus," said the latter, as he complied, " your conduct is inexplicable. Why are you so 
<li n=?>anxious that I should not go to Silvermere, nor renew my acquaintance with Marion 1 You must 
<li n=?>have some reason for all this; and, if so, why conceal it from me 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"If nothing short of such an extremity will induce you to follow my counsel, I must even come 
<li n=?>to it. Maiion is not what you have supposed her. You imagine that her love for you has kept her 
<li n=?>single. Ask of whom you will, if such be the general opinion. Till yesterday, she gave herself to 
<li n=?>another, who cannot aspire to a thousandth part of your merit, but who happened to be more favored 
<li n=?>by fortune. Last night, you became the richest, and she changed ; but would Vibert be contented 
<li n=?>with a partner who preferred another V 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Marcus ! — this other ! It is of yourself you speak 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Ask all the world, if she did not make herself notorious with me. She made me distrust all 
<li n=?>womankind. Vibert, let us both leave her to the reflections of one who has deserved to be forsaken." 
<li n=?>" May it not be that you, and not I, have mistaken her 1 She might have preferred your company 
<li n=?>because you were my friend, and you might have fancied that she loved you because you loved her. 
<li n=?>It is needless to contradict me — men do not tremble and turn pale because their friends are going to 
<li n=?>marry jilts. I do not blame you; for not to love Marion is beyond the power even of fiiendship. 
<li n=?>Let us only be fair rivals, and not attempt to discourage each other by doing her injustice. Let us 
<li n=?>go hand in hand, and each prefer his suit. For my part, I promise you, that if you succeed, I will 
<li n=?>yield without enmity." 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>34 burton's gentleman's i 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Marcus staggered as he rose. Vibert's countenance was grave but not unfrienJIy. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Go on then," said the former, in a deep broken voice, and with every feature convulsed ; at the 
<li n=?>same time, he turned himself homeward ; and Vibeit, seeing that it was advisable to part company, 
<li n=?>pursued his course towards Silvermere. Marcus made but a few strides and paused. He clenched 
<li n=?>his teeth, and cast a wild glance at his rifle — made one or two hesitating steps, and then bounded after. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Long and intense was the watch which the sisters kept that morning in the direction of the Black 
<li n=?>Valley, but no one was seen to come forth from it. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" In other times," said Marion, " Vibert could arrive to breaifast, and it is now long past noon." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Edith was not mistress of the gay consolation which had so often turned a tear to a smile, and 
<li n=?>framed an excuse out of the wild and stormy weather, which it was evident her own heart could 
<li n=?>not admit. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"He did not use to mind stormy weather," returned Marion. " Besides, we heard a shot fired, 
<li n=?>and we know that no one has the range of the Black Valley but Vibert and his friend Marcus." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" It was, perhaps, only the cracking of some time-worn stem, giving way to the hurricane ; and, 
<li n=?>if it was a shot, we must take into consideration the peculiar nature of our cavaliers of the world, 
<li n=?>and make allowance for what they cannot help. How can we suppose that Vibert could pass the 
<li n=?>Badger's Bank without paying his compliments to the wild cat, or enjoying the shriek of the bird 
<li n=?>of prey that comes thither to tear his victim 1 He will be here to dinner, and make amends for his 
<li n=?>slowness by a strange tale of the wonders which caused it." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Edith, you are drawing the character of Marcus — this is not like Vibert." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Well, well, then — do not speak with such a tremor, and he shall be a bright exception ; and the 
<li n=?>only punishment he shall have is to be dismissed from your mind, just whilst I tell you why I have 
<li n=?>been thinking of the faithless Marcus. Do you listen 1 Yes. Why, then, dear Marion, I must 
<li n=?>have you guess the reason for my sage determination to obtain reverence as a maiden-aunt." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Edith !" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Yes, yes — I see you have guessed aright. 'Tis a false-hearted but, Marion, he was my first ; 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>and to be deserted for you is not a crime which makes him an absolute monster. Come away from 
<li n=?>this window, and let us rest our eyes, for they have followed the battling of the kites and crows till 
<li n=?>Tve grow giddy, and dreamy, and fanciful. Come, come, my bride of Hazledell, and listen to the lost 
<li n=?>Tits of the soon undisputed pride of Silvermere." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It was late in the day when they joined the rest of the family, and still no tidings had been heard 
<li n=?>of Vibert. There was a silence in the circle which proved that their uneasiness was not confined 
<li n=?>to themselves, and presently the consternation was completed by the mysterious countenance of a 
<li n=?>servant who called out his master. Marion and Edith clasped each other's neck in the sure presen- 
<li n=?>timent of something fatal. The truth was less cruel than their suspense, for though communicated 
<li n=?>with all the care and tenderness which its nature required, it left them insensible to the horrors of 
<li n=?>which they had been the victims. The sisters and the two friends were doomed never to meet again. 
<li n=?>The fate of Vibert had been discovered by the game-keepers as they were taking their evening round, 
<li n=?>by the spot where he had been left bleeding and breathless by the dastard hand of his rival. That 
<li n=?>of Marcus was best known to the fiends which pursued him. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>We will not swell our history with an account of all the gradations by which a thrilling horror 
<li n=?>may settle down to a calm and lasting woe. The first news which followed the foregoing events re- 
<li n=?>lated to Vibert's uncle. His infirm frame had sunk beneath his afiliction, and he lay in the family- 
<li n=?>vault beside his unfortunate nephew. Of Marcus, nothing had ever been heard. A stranger had 
<li n=?>been found, apparently self-destroyed, in a distant part of the country, but nobody had come forward 
<li n=?>to recognize him. There was, of course, a surmise that this might have been the fugitive, Marcus, 
<li n=?>and, whether true or false, he never gave grounds for any other. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Years passed away, but the characters of Marion and Edith resumed no more their natural tone. 
<li n=?>The last was never seen to resume her smiles, nor the first drop a tear. Their feelings had been 
<li n=?>trampled down too rudely to spring again. What were their fates eventually is an inquiry of small 
<li n=?>importance — the history of their hearts is concluded.

<h1>THE ETERNAL FIRE </h1>
<h1>ON THE BANKS OF THE CASPIAN SEA </h1>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>BT JOHN EICIIFELD, </h1>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>This fire is in the peninsula of Apsclieron, twenty versts from Baku, and is justly called one of 
<li n=?>the wonders of southern Russia. I have visited this spot. It is a burning desert, from the surface 
<li n=?>of which subterraneous (lames here and there issue, which are occasioned by the exhalations of the 
<li n=?>naptha. Though this fire ma- not be eternal, yet it is extremely old, for there are traditions of the 
<li n=?>origin of simiUar phenomena* in other parts; for instance, in the Ural, on the river Mangischlak, 
<li n=?>in the village of Sulp-Aul (v. Pallas) and that which I have seen in Wallachia, on the little river 
<li n=?>Slanika, near the village of Lapatar, on Mount Klaschna. But the origin of the fire in the neigh- 
<li n=?>borhood of Baku is buried in the obscurity of the remotest antiquity. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The first appearance of this fire, in an age when the phenomena of nature were so little known 
<li n=?>and explored, might appear supernatural. It is well known that Media was the seat of Zoroaster's 
<li n=?>doctrine, and the introduction of those mysterious receptacles of the eternal fire, which the Maho- 
<li n=?>metans every where destroyed. Only the miraculous flame of Baku arrested the blind fury of the 
<li n=?>Mahometans. The temple consecrated to fire is still preserved by the remnant of the ancient Parsees, 
<li n=?>or fire-worshippers, who, though scattered over the immense tracts of Persia and India, come hither 
<li n=?>to perform the prayers imposed on them by their vows. This temple, however, is no beautiful 
<li n=?>specimen of architecture, but a simple stone square, in the centre of which stands the altar, from 
<li n=?>which issues the eternal fire. The flat roof is supported on four columns, from which a constant 
<li n=?>fire, conducted by tubes, likewise ascends. On thg roof, above the altar, is a fittle belfry. 
</p>

<li n=?>On dark nights this temple is descried even at a great distance, and is the more interesting and 
<li n=?>majestic in the eyes of the traveller, as the brilliant flame does not resemble Vulcan's destructive fire, 
<li n=?>but is like some mystei:ious phenomenon awakening sublime recollections of antiquity. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Within the wall which surrounds the temple, there are some stone houses, and a small garden, 
<li n=?>the residences of eight Parsee monks."- During the time of worship, they strike the bell once, 
<li n=?>generally on their entrance into the temple, and then prostrate themselves before the altar. After 
<li n=?>remaining for a pretty considerable time in this position, they arise, strike the bell once more, and 
<li n=?>then finish their prayers. They give the fire the firstlings of every sort of food. They eat no meat, 
<li n=?>and live entirely on vegetables. Their particular affection to animals is probably the cause of it ; the 
<li n=?>guardians of the Holy Fire keep a great number of dogs, which they treat as friends and companions. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It is evident that they prefer their religion to all others, and consider themselves as purer than 
<li n=?>other men, because they are favored with the purest notions of the divinity. In conversing with 
<li n=?>persons of a different religion, they protect themselves by certain prayers, which they repeat in an 
<li n=?>under voice. They seemed much displeased when my companions weie going to dress their dinner 
<li n=?>at the same fire as theirs. To satisfy them, I had the kettle removed to another part. When they 
<li n=?>carried water near us, they always cried out, Brama, Brama, Brama, doubtless to counteract our 
<li n=?>influence upon it. Perhaps they have a particular respect for water; at least, in remote antiquity, it 
<li n=?>was considered, by many of the followers of Zoroaster, as a divinity. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The atmosphere in the temple, and in the surrounding court-yard, is very warm, on which ac. 
<li n=?>count the monks wear a very light clothing. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>It is reported that the monks, in former times, frequently made singular vows; for instance, to re- 
<li n=?>main for several years in a constrained attitude, with their arms raised, oi holding up one foot, etc. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>* They originated, at no very distant period, by the lightning having rent the upper hard layer of 
<li n=?>the mountain, which made an issue for the inflammable vapors, and, at the same time, caused the 
<li n=?>flames to arise. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>- The Europeans call them, as well as all other fire-worshippers, Guebers ; which seems to be a 
<li n=?>corruption of the Persian word Giaur, by which they designate all those who profess a different re- 
<li n=?>ligion. They call the Russians, Sare-Giaur, or Sare-Guebr, i. e. light brown idolaters ; probably be- 
<li n=?>cause they observe fewer persons with black hair among them, than among the people of Asia.

<li n=?>This, indeed, has ceased ; but they still endeavor, as they used to do, to prevent the women from ap- 
<li n=?>proaching the sacred fire ; probably, tliat their presence may not divert their attention. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In every thing that surrounds them, these monks are very neat and cleanly. They have no su- 
<li n=?>perfluity, but poverty is unknown among them. Their cells are likewise lighted by the subterraneous 
<li n=?>fire; which is easily extinguished by covering the vent through which the gas issues. The verdure 
<li n=?>of the garden on the other side of the court-yard of the temple, and the delightful shade of the trees, 
<li n=?>afford these hermits a refreshing coolness. If superstition finds, in the evanescent flame, an object 
<li n=?>of adoration, no inconsiderable advantage is derived from the naplha, which is so common here, and 
<li n=?>in the neighborhood, and yields to the ciown an annual revenue of 200,000 rubles.

<h1>THE COUSINS </h1>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>It was a soft evening in May, 1812, when Catharine Harman, a laJy of noble bearing, and iffl 
<li n=?>perial beauty, was stioUing in a grove of oaks that ornamented the grounds of a mansion on' the 
<li n=?>banks of the Chesapeake. Far beyond the share of the most favored was the lovehness of the lady, 
<li n=?>and the fairest of her sex in her charming presence, might have wondered at nature's partiahty. 
<li n=?>Apparently the showers of but eighteen springs had freshened the bloom of her beauty, yet the next 
<li n=?>evening her twentieth birth-day was to be commemorated at the noble mansion of her family. 
<li n=?>Fairer than all the lover dreams of paradise was the exquisite symmetry of her person. The outline- 
<li n=?>was swelling round, and softly undulating as if finished by angels from heaven's rarest models. At 
<li n=?>rest, the matchless proportions were health and beauty deified ; but in motion, best was their won- 
<li n=?>derful loveliness developed. And her walk had the imposing dignity of the high dama nurtured in 
<li n=?>the olden courts of lady-love and troubadour, combined with the elegant, the tripping simplicity of a 
<li n=?>Hebe. She stepped — oh ! she floated, joyous and inspired, as if to the voluptuous melody of an Ita- 
<li n=?>lian opera ; and as her elegant figure, traced so faint, yet so roundly full, in a rich close robe of the 
<li n=?>times, swept the long grass, noiseless as the sailing albatross, and wound among the whispering trees 
<li n=?>as a virgin cloud from the court of the moon, a painter might have sketched the portrait of a celes- 
<li n=?>tial huntress alighting in her groves. Her ankle and foot — for ah ! there is a dangerous coquetry 
<li n=?>in a pretty foot — small, and charmingly shaped — the indispensable of womanly beauty — were 
<li n=?>barely seen ere they vanished in their mysterious ambush, as if one glance were enough to enchant. 
<li n=?>Her face ! alas ! the artist's finest touch were even Apollo the artist, could not breathe its passicii, 
<li n=?>its divinity ; to look on it were to wither the heart, and give memory immortality. It was not the 
<li n=?>cherubic laughingness of the playful girl, but the matured, the superb, and fascinating loveliness of 
<li n=?>the woman. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Her complexion was that happiest union of color, seen only in female cheeks and in the pei-fec- 
<li n=?>tion of painting — the softest blending of the lily and the rose — yet it rivalled the fairest lily or the 
<li n=?>richest rose. Her head was of splendid mould, and hex forehead high and queenly. A few shoit 
<li n=?>curls clustered like the locust flowers on its ravishing fairness ; and waving masses of dark brown 
<li n=?>hair, straying in ringlets from under a jewelled clasp, flung their wild profusion over a neck of snow, 
<li n=?>and a bosom whose faultless contour rivalled the proudest creations of the Grecian chisel, in whicfi 
<li n=?>nothing of beauty or grace is unfinished. That glossy, voluptuous hair, was like the luxuriant sea- 
<li n=?>grass in the mermaid's bower, floating over, yet slyly showing its virgin pearls. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The jetty eyebrow was pencilled with the rainbow's curve; her lashes were long, black, and ex- 
<li n=?>quisite ; and there was that thrilling and mystic depth of soul in her lustrous black eyes which the 
<li n=?>flower of nature's nobility only have. By turns they were soft as the houri's glance — by turns they 
<li n=?>flashed as the moonlit-rill, or beamed with the still enthusiasm of the stars. Truly the eye is the 
<li n=?>mirror of woman, for its reflection is mystery ; even in sleep it has a spell we dare not trust. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The nose was strictly Grecian — that classic inheritance of so many fair claimants ; the sunny, 
<li n=?>oval cheek vvas a delicious repose of blushes ; and the round superb chin, when drawn proudly up, 
<li n=?>was slightly doubled. But her scarlet lip of scented ripeness — ah ! there was a witchery there that 
<li n=?>mocks the power of pen. Even anger cannot rob a woman's lip of its magic, for in its pout there rs 
<li n=?>death to the young heart. In jo3'ous love, it is a cradle of smiles tempting an impassioned caress — 
<li n=?>a fount of delicious nectar intoxicating to sip — or rather it is the honeyed altar of passionate love. 
<li n=?>But in offended pride and bridling beauty, how ravishing its toss, its quiver ! The lips of the dan- 
<li n=?>gerous Catharine Harman wore the softest smile, the rosiest pout, the proudest cuil, and in their ver- 
<li n=?>milion shadow were arrayed a set of teeth whiter than the foam of the sea. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The expression of her countenance was difficult to define. In pensiveness, it was poetry in its 
<li n=?>richest garb ; in animation, it copied the wave of the laughing lake ; and, again, it wore that lofty some- 
<li n=?>thing, that hauteur perhaps, that springs from a noble and cultivated intellect ; but at times its.

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>wondrous meaning was as changeful and exhaustless as the picture of the cloud in the rippling 
<li n=?>spring. Her face was a gay masquerade of expression. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A child of sorrow was this beautiful being — amiable as she was lovely, yet unfathomable in a 
<li n=?>passing acquaintance. Outwardly lively and dashing, she was one of that strange few who, when 
<li n=?>they list, can stand calm, dark, and unread under the scrutiny of the world, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Grief has been said to exert a chastening influence, but some'imes it nurtures dangerous predis- 
<li n=?>positions — but of this again. At the age of fifteen, Catharine Harman had lost a sainted mother. 
<li n=?>Two years after, an only brother, led by that fever of travel and adventure so seducing to youth, had 
<li n=?>left his home, and been killed in a duel in a distant state. His blooming sister was left with but two 
<li n=?>relatives on earth — a passionate indulgent old father, and a portionless male cousin, two years her 
<li n=?>junior, who was avi-ay at college. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The fair Kate Harman h id been brought up a pretty pet, which is to say that she was self-willed, 
<li n=?>though, like many pets, her heart was in the right place. The rose that flowers in a garden of 
<li n=?>weeds is the sweeter by contrast, for it is at once associated with some inherent excellence which 
<li n=?>defied neglect. So with the happy pet, whose innate goodness cannot be spoiled by parental indul- 
<li n=?>gence. By natural consequence of her rearing, Catharine was somewhat of a coquette. Start not ! 
<li n=?>nor cross thyself, guileless reader, for thou art generous, and coquettes are a much abused race. 
<li n=?>What a brilliant world of song and loveliness, of sighs and smiles, of tears and thrilling tones, of wild 
<li n=?>reproach, sweet repentance, and eloquent sorrow arc embodied in that single name of coquette ! At 
<li n=?>once the delighted fancy pictures a superb and accomplished female luxuriating in the " purple light 
<li n=?>of love." The very name implies beauty, talent, and amiability ; in that these alone win admiration, 
<li n=?>and by these only will gentlemen admit they are conquered. That wretched ambition, which pub- 
<li n=?>licly displays the peacock's feathers, is not the intoxicating play upon hearts of a beautiful and po- 
<li n=?>lished woman. The firat is the toy of vanity — the other, the innocent love of being loved — an evi- 
<li n=?>dence at once of overflowing kindness. This is the pleasing diflercnce between the painted flirt and 
<li n=?>the witching, glorious creature who coquettes from conscious nobleness — claiming homage as the 
<li n=?>prerogative of her heavenly nature. If her smile is a lure, (sure it is a pious fraud to lead mortals 
<li n=?>to heaven !) it honestly shows the gilded barb, and adoring man takes it with a rapture which 
<li n=?>breathes, " 'tis delicious to yield when angels tempt." Nothing in this world is half so harmless and 
<li n=?>unasking as love ; emotion so gentle and so gratuitous, cannot fiiil to awaken a regard in its object, 
<li n=?>thus bringing into play commendable exorcises of feehng. Females delight in the gentle charge of 
<li n=?>heartless coquette. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Now, coquetry in a cottage proves at once that it is natural ; and, zounds ! who, in this christian 
<li n=?>age, will say that adored woman shall be rifled of her birthright 1 Rivalry is the soul of love, as 
<li n=?>jealousy is its test ; and tiie real lover of a dashing coquette feels a delicious uncertainty which 
<li n=?>teaches him truly to value her. He must be a happy man, who is loved by one of these captivating 
<li n=?>beings ; there must be — oh, there is — an intensity of devotion in the love that prefers him to the 
<li n=?>world of its choice. Vanity — than which no feeling is more slandered and more disinterested — 
<li n=?>shares the giddy triumph. To think that she is the queen of hearts, and he the queen's king ! Many 
<li n=?>may have heard the story of Oian al Bekar, who was the devil amongst women — a very prince of 
<li n=?>coquettes — and Zelirc, his queen. They reclined in a nuptial bower, and the prince whispered — 
<li n=?>" You are beautiful, Zelire, and love me ; I am happy, for all men envy me," and he kissed his de- 
<li n=?>lighted bride. " You love me, Oian," murmured she, "and I am happy, for all women envy me." 
<li n=?>Can a prospect of domestic felicity be more flattering 1 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>To the belle in polished, or perhaps artificial society, coquetry is an armor of security — one of the 
<li n=?>acquired luxuries of society. Tears are a woman's weapons with her husband, sighs with her lover, 
<li n=?>but she must fight the cruel world with coquetry. There is less of the amiable weakness in the 
<li n=?>other sex, from lack of power ; for, alas, they all would if they could, and do as they can. Where, 
<li n=?>then, is the credit of good motives for its condemnation by gentlemen 1 Ladies seldom cast the 
<li n=?>charge on one another. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Star-gazers may have seen before now a gay, innocent-looking cloud suddenly darken and shoot 
<li n=?>forth lightning which it seemed too gentle to have harbored. So it was sometimes with Catharine 
<li n=?>Harman, To look on her faultless face, one would have never thought it passion's throne, yet she 
<li n=?>had that flavor of prettiness called " temper." There is something " interesting," highly so, in the 
<li n=?>female of holy placidity of disposition — one whose spirit glides unruffled along the calm tide of the 
<li n=?>ocean of life, and floats into port without a gun or a flag. How sweet, how heavenly ! — yes, a little 
<li n=?>too much so for this world. That " interesting" is an equivocal compliment, at best. Give me the 
<li n=?>woman who has a leaven of mortality ; a spirited girl, who will bridle up and argue, for nothing is 
<li n=?>so surpassingly delightful as the making up of a lovers' quarrel. A lake, sheltered by mountains, is 
<li n=?>very pretty, and all that, in its sweet repose ; but w ho delights not more in the sea — the wild, ma- 
<li n=?>jestic, beautiful, and laughing sea — which also has its hours of bewitching rest 1 Oh ! the .spice of 
<li n=?>"variety ! 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Well, Catharine, in addition to the sin of coquetry, had tempei. Yet there was but one chord, 
<li n=?>waking but one tone, to but one touch. The untimely and mysterious end of her brother had 
<li n=?>wrought a perilous effect on her sensitive nature. Few feelings are so beautiful as a sister's love —

<p>
<li n=?>trusting as the dove in kindness returned, and, like the dove, unmurmuring in neglect. Its influence 
<li n=?>is holy and lasting ; for kw brothers of amiable sisters are ever unkind to the sex. But this theme 
<li n=?>is for gifted pens. Catharine Harman had loved her brother Charles with an intensity equalled only 
<li n=?>by its return. At the restless age of eighteen he had left his paternal roof with a hard wrung con- 
<li n=?>sent, and the first news of his wanderings was that he had fallen in a duel at New Orleans. Mourn- 
<li n=?>ful is the grief for the wanderer whose eyes are closed by strangers' hands, for it has no consolation. 
<li n=?>It seems so hard to be robbed of the last look, the parting message, of those who are dear. Had 
<li n=?>his sister drunk his last sigh, and planted the willow on his youthful grave, tears had been a luxury ; 
<li n=?>but as it was, memory had no farewell look or word to cheer its melancholy. The glad stream that 
<li n=?>has been dammed across, is slow and silent, yet at some time it will burst the barrier that gave it 
<li n=?>strength. As Catharine brooded over her brother's death, a new and powerful passion crept over 
<li n=?>her young heart — an unyielding abhorrence of duelling and duellists. This strong and absorbing 
<li n=?>feeling lit up disdain in her glance, and lent her tongue the withering eloquence of passion at the 
<li n=?>name or sight of a duellist. Each blighting sarcasm was an expiation to the shade of her brother. 
<li n=?>At such moments, how different was she from the winning Catharine, the courteous and animated 
<li n=?>belle ■ 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Gifted, accomplished, and wealthy ; at home in the graceful dance, or waking the melody of Eu- 
<li n=?>terpe from her harp ; the light of the gay saloon, and the toast of the private circle ; it was not won- 
<li n=?>derful that this brilliant favorite of nature should exercise the dangerous power of her inheritance. 
<li n=?>Many a conquered youth had knelt impassioned at the shrine of her beauty, and thought himself 
<li n=?>blessed with a tear of pity. The rich and powerful had courted her alliance ; but, with the air of 
<li n=?>an empress, she answered, " My liberty is dearer than thou." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>But the fair Kate has been walking all this time in the grove by herself. She neared the skirt 
<li n=?>of the wood that sloped to a grassy bank, and flung its image on the tide. Leaning on the trunk 
<li n=?>of an ample oak, while the leaves of a pendent bough were wooing her lips and ringlets, she put on 
<li n=?>a poetical face, and gazed musingly on the water. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The scene was brilliant and beautiful. Mysteriously charming it is to trace the landscape's sha- 
<li n=?>dow pencilled bright as its copy in the waveless tide. Fair earth is a vain baggage, and delights to 
<li n=?>take a peep at herself, as some pretty school giil, who carries a mirror in her bosom to dress her 
<li n=?>ringlets by. There, curiously inverted in that glorious bay, stood every quiet tree and yellow cliff, 
<li n=?>the setting sun, the anchored clouds, and the bandit fish-hawk watching still by his naked nest. It 
<li n=?>was nature sketching her own portrait from her looking glass. Far from the shore, hung dizzily be- 
<li n=?>tween two heavens, sat a slight pilot schooner, raking true to her own weblike outline, on which she 
<li n=?>rested keel to keel. Here and there a stout bay craft was dozing on the crimson couch, and a thin 
<li n=?>column of smoke curled up amidships. At the distance of a mile, a gay looking ship, the palace of 
<li n=?>the cabin-king, appeared dotted with painted ports, and her sails and colors hanging sleeping in 
<li n=?>their pride. The sailor's favorite lay, " the girl I left behind me," wandered from the rigging to the 
<li n=?>shore, plaintive as an unheard farewell. Far down, a long low point stole away into the channel, 
<li n=?>with its sentinel lighthouse stark at the end; and, beyond, the blue Chesapeake rolled his funeral 
<li n=?>tide till sky and sea were blended in the enchantment of distance. Around the embowered man- 
<li n=?>sion a profusion of trees flung the mingled shade of the classic elm, the collonaded poplar, the whis- 
<li n=?>pering locust, and the lordly oak. Rows of white outhouses glanced among the foliage ; and, around 
<li n=?>the neat negro quarters, troops of noisy young " tow heads" were gamboling with dogs of all de- 
<li n=?>grees. Near by, an orchard of choice and various fruit was sending an odorous tribute to the sky ; 
<li n=?>and a spacious garden on the southern wing, with its jetting fount, its silver rill, and vine-clad bow- 
<li n=?>er, its winding walks, and delicious shrubbery, spoke the culture of a refined and finished taste. 
<li n=?>From a flowering lawn to the bay, there stretched a beautiful grove of oaks, the play ground of a 
<li n=?>pair of fawns, and the favorite stroll of their lovely mistress. It was a striking and animated picture 
<li n=?>,of southern comfort and elegance. Over all, the setting sun brushed his burnished mantle, for he is 
<li n=?>a rare and skilful artist. The exquisite blending of ray and shade, the light in gay reUef, and the 
<li n=?>mystic tints of the far blue hills, are each and all his patent of matchless artistry.

<li n=?>That flow of soft delight which lovely scenery awakens in the gifted mind, stole over the lady as 
<li n=?>the floating serenade of the lute, and she murmured, " it is beautiful." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The scene," answered a low and melodious voice, " is insipid, for beauty is by comparison. An 
<li n=?>angel is an angel only on earth, in heaven she is but a woman. This scene is dull, for its charms 
<li n=?>have fled to deck a fairer shrine. Nature is jealous of you, peerless Catharine, as your music master 
<li n=?>was when his fair pupil excelled him." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A graceful foim of rounded eighteen was bending before her, and a sad and handsome face beamed 
<li n=?>upon the startled lady. She knew him not, and the stranger enjoyed her confusion with silent va- 
<li n=?>nity — for there is a singular delight in the incognito of one returning among his friends after an ab- 
<li n=?>sence of years. No youth, especially at such a time, can bear to be saluted with familiar recogni- 
<li n=?>tion. That careless " how are you why you have not changed much," is chilling enough to the 
<li n=?>fancied unknown. A stare and a distant bow are the most subtle flattery- — for vanity reads in them 
<li n=?>a change of personal appearance — for the better of course. Thus it may have been in the present 
<li n=?>TPt. y. — o. r. B 2.

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>instance, and the youth looked at Catharine, as she thought, with provoking impudence — but then 
<li n=?>he was so handsome I 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"And I," again spoke the stranger, folding his aims, and bowing his head in eloquent melancho- 
<li n=?>ly, "have mused for years on that only balm of absence, remembrance of the loved, to find that I 
<li n=?>am forgotten. Would for his peace that Walter de Berrian were blessed with his cousin's forgetful- 
<li n=?>ness." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Walter, Walter ! my own dear cousin, I did not know you," exclaimed Catharine, quite taken 
<li n=?>by delightful surprife, as she extended her hand, and almost herself. In another moment she re- 
<li n=?>tired, sweetly confused, before the trembling and grateful gaze of the youth. iiThe easy belle was 
<li n=?>abashed, and theie was mischief in her soft confusion. The young man at her side was an orphan, 
<li n=?>tinder the guardianship of her father. Four yeais ago he left for college, a bashful stripling, whom 
<li n=?>his wild romping cousin had often kissed just to see him blush. She had read his letters, breathing 
<li n=?>a poetry of feeling which she could scarcely realize from the pen of the retiiing Walter. But Catha- 
<li n=?>line was flashing on her career of beauty and triumph, and seldom thought of her absent cousin, un- 
<li n=?>less with a wonder of ideal interest. He stood beside her now an elegant gentleman, with thought 
<li n=?>upon his brow, and soul in his sad black eye — her equal in knowledge and mind — for a moment the 
<li n=?>change embarrassed her. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Your hand only !" ejaculated the young De Berrian, in strangely musical tone, as the blushing 
<li n=?>lady drew back. " This is a cold meeting — a slander to our heart. Why, my cousin, if wc art glad 
<li n=?>to meet, should our joy be locked in this unmeaning shake Why not lake counsel of our feelingsl" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I do," she answered, with a pretty curtesy. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" We did not meet so once, Catharine, nor is this the greeting of kindred spirits — excuse me for 
<li n=?>complimenting myself." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Oh sir, since you are so disinterested, you are welcome to my share of the compliment. But 
<li n=?>•what of our meetings oncel I have'nt any memory ; you know when I used to climb that cliffyon- 
<li n=?>der for the flowers on its brink, while you were praying me to come down, I never looked behind, 
<li n=?>it made me giddy." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"Ah it is true of all conquerors that they drown the cries of the wounded in the music of victory. 
<li n=?>But I meant, dearest cousin, that our hands formerly met after our lips — thinking they were safe in 
<li n=?>so innocent an example," returned Walter doubtfully. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Why then,'' answered the laughing belle, " you were a sly pretty boy, and I, a little woman, 
<li n=?>for I had already broken some dozen of hearts, and worn as many miniatures. But now you have 
<li n=?>grown so tall and handsome, with such meaning in your eyes — I — you would not have your cousin 
<li n=?>kiss a man"!" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"No, loveliest girl! Never may that monster of beard and brutality wound my cousin's cherry 
<li n=?>lips. Reserve their dew and breath for the caress of thy softer sex and the warm touch of adoring 
<li n=?>boyhood. I am just eighteen," and, as the pleasing Walter spoke, his arm warily circled the round 
<li n=?>waist of the half-willing Catharine, and, amid slaps and stifled screams, he sought her averted lips. 
<li n=?>After a tantalizing chase, he snatched a lily hand from over the blushing fugitives, and printed upon 
<li n=?>them a long, delicious kiss. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"How da:e you sir" demanded Catharine, drawing up her pretty chin. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"I am dying — my Ufe is the forfeit of my rashness." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" See what you have made of my hair, you impudent boy !" she said with a fatal glance, as she 
<li n=?>shook out the disordered tresses. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The youth stood as if he had suddenly waked in the bower of a Peri : and well might the exqui- 
<li n=?>site being before him have brought in question the reality of sight. The rich blood was planting 
<li n=?>roses in her superb cheeks, and through the splendid curls, that showered over hex face, he saw a 
<li n=?>pouting lip and a witching eye. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Saint Mary !" whispered De Berrian, as if he feared to frighten the vision, "what crime, fairest 
<li n=?>exile, did you commit in Heaven " 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Theft sir," she returned with a penitent sigh. "It is my only fault; I stole Cupid's arrows." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Then it is no mystery that they never wound yourself," said Walter, recovering his mortality. 
<li n=?>" Fatal hirntress ! now that the stolen quiver is nearly empty, in that you have more heaux than ar- 
<li n=?>rows, you kill with the more deadly artillery of your eyes. Such is the boasted progress of refinement. 
<li n=?>Yet spare a triumph so poor as I ! Fire not from that murderous ambush again. The next glance 
<li n=?>■will read the treasured secret of years," and his head fell mournfully upon his bosom. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Oh ! is there a casket there that will hold a secret so long  Give it to me, my own kind cou- 
<li n=?>sin, and I won't look death at you again," and she leaned imploringly on his arm. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" It is yours, my adored Catharine," he murmured low and passionately, " I love you." 
<li n=?>" Love me ! I hope you do: I would not have a cousin that did not love me," She looked the 
<li n=?>sweetest surprise, and turned a demure face to the perplexed youth. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"Roguish counterfeit, and ridiculous me !" thought he, "I must pretend innocence too. The 
<li n=?>surest lure for a butterfly is a painted rose." De Berrian had read much, seen much, and thought 
<li n=?>more. His fancy was rich, and his conversational powers of the first order. He adverted to the 
<li n=?>beautiful scenery aroimd them, and, insensibly, Catharine was drawn from her perfection of sim- 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>THE PRIVATEER. 41 </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>plicity. Her gifted cousin was spieading a rare repast with a tasteful hand, and she partook with 
<li n=?>kindred enthusiasm. They descanted on the "beauties of nature," "painting," and " music," and 
<li n=?>wept over "poetry" and tlie "jp thetics." The cousins were shining in a new and dazzling hght. 
<li n=?>They were surprised at the extent of their powers, delighted with themselves, and with each other. 
<li n=?>Love, in the natural order of events, was the next theme, and they both seemed awaie of the law,, 
<li n=?>for Walter was trembling, and playing with hu unsuspecting little hand, and Catharine gave her 
<li n=?>head the ndke droop to one side, and looked delightfully simple, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" To me," said Walter with a speculative air, " it is inscrutable that actions and feelings should 
<li n=?>contradict each other. In this I am unblest, for my tongue is the confidant of my heart, which, as 
<li n=?>with your sex, means, that it keeps secrets by calling in assistance. Now, m.y cousin, I love you — 
<li n=?>see how my tongue betrays its faith — do you love me.^" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Why what do you take me for, Walter 1 Do not the laws of Lsaven and earth command us to 
<li n=?>love our relatives" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Why will you not understand mel" he asked, with a passionate vehemence. " My love, beau- 
<li n=?>tiful woman, is not that calm, unanxious instinct of kindred. (Dh ! it is the freshest dew of the soul 
<li n=?>falling on its favorite rose ! Catharine, we were children together, and the youngest tendril of the 
<li n=?>vine circles the nearest flower, and it never loosens its clasp for another." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Beautiful," she interrupted, with enthusiasm ; " but the vine grows, puts forth other tendrils, andr 
<li n=?>the youngest is first to decay, while the poor flower has long since perished in its withering clasp. 
<li n=?>Heaven save this frail flower from such keeping !" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" They died faithfully together — an emblem " 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" But I don't want to die, dear, I'll tell you, skeptic — I named a wreath of flowers, " love," and 
<li n=?>threw it on the stream of isles in our garden. It floated gayly on, coquetting with every wave and 
<li n=?>bough, lingering a while on the golden sands of a flowered islet, and gliding away with a promise 
<li n=?>to come back A fairer spot was ever in view — some far sweet isle, in the majesty of distance, 
<li n=?>wi'ched the loitering voyager along, till the poor withered thing of vanity was stranded on a bub- 
<li n=?>ble. First love may be sincere while it lasts, but the same beauties of person and mind, by the 
<li n=?>same impulse, will charm in another. Absence conqueis love by love's own weapons." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"Thank you, sweet coz, for the lesson you leach; for, since my idol is the fairest and best, my 
<li n=?>faith will never be tempted." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Mine is not equally guarded," she rejoined laughing, " or rather I never loved. I don't believe 
<li n=?>in that lisping romance of the nursery. I have frailties enough." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Frailties!" said De Berrian shoitly." I cannot understand that senseless afTectation which can 
<li n=?>name the noblest passion in the gift of heaven a frailty. Yet listen, Catharine," he softened as he 
<li n=?>lip put on its haughtiness, " I know that you are kind and gentle as your fawns, for the child ne^ 
<li n=?>ver forgets the playmate of his cradle. Your bosom thrills with sympathy at the tale of sorrow, and 
<li n=?>that liquid eye is lit with heaven's light when virtue triumphs. Surely love would sue to nestle in 
<li n=?>a heart like yours. Ah! there is a remembrance, sweet with the fragiance of other years, which 
<li n=?>bids me speak. Here, under these trees, we have woven the blue hare-bells together, and you have 
<li n=?>sportingly kissed me ! O then, even then, I could have held your soft sweet lips to mine, and wished 
<li n=?>that moment eternity. Then I learned to adore you, and if there is one feeling unmixed with self, 
<li n=?>one trait that hallows frailty, it is the delicious love of early years, which blooms and smiles when 
<li n=?>the head is white, and the eye rayless. From birth my nature named you happiness, my honor was 
<li n=?>woven with you as glory, and my young ambition saw in you its heaven. Mine is the love that 
<li n=?>loves but once, and mine I offer thee." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Thank you," answered the beauty, in a rapture of modesty. " How proud I am of my cousin— 
<li n=?>so eloquent, so tender. I am in torment to show my triumph." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Is this your answer 1" demanded Walter, hastily, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" What is the question, sir 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Do you love me 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" That's not fair," she returned, sweetly ; " do you love we" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Oh ! devotedly, my first and fairest," and he caught her hand, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Not so fast," she exclaimed, pretending surprise ; " the first flowers of spring are fairest and 
<li n=?>frailest, too. Your ofl'er is painful and unexpected ; speak of it no more." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Yet Catharine felt proud, gratified at his long cherished aflfection, which, as a romping, teazin^ 
<li n=?>girl, she had slyly seen in a thousand adoring looks and silent rambles. As a lovely and winning 
<li n=?>belle, there lingered amid all her giddy triumphs a tender interest for her pensive cousin. His love 
<li n=?>she felt was a feeling tribute to her worth, and then he was a proud and portionless orphan. But 
<li n=?>it would never do that the hunted coquette should be won so easily. She would not admit to her- 
<li n=?>self that she loved him ; yet, as she stole a look at his faultless figure and handsome face, eloquent 
<li n=?>with vexation and disappointment, something whispered—" If ever I should love, my noble cousia 
<li n=?>will be the happy raa.n," 
</p>

<h1>THEY CALL ME COLD AND PASSIONLESS </h1>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>Thet call me cold and passionless — ah ! little do they know 
<li n=?>How deep and strong the cuirenl is that silently doth flow ; 
<li n=?>The babbling brook and rivulet in noisy murmurs plash, 
<li n=?>And loud the mountain torrent's heard from rocky height to dash ; 
<li n=?>But plainly are the pebbles seen those streamlets murmur o'er, 
<li n=?>And soon is dried the rocky bed whence broke that torrent's roar. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>But give to me — for unison itholdeth with my soul — 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The rivei's calm and noiseless, yet never ceasing roll ; 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The proudly firm and onward pour of waters on their course, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Alike unchecked by luring smiles, as unrestrained by force, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>That kisses now the flovv'ery bank, the drooping willow steeps, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Unchanged then past the castle's base, through frowning ravine sweeps. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>They call me cold and passionless — ah ! little can they tell 
<li n=?>Beneath the mountain's cheerless side how many a spring may well, 
<li n=?>Whose sweet refreshing waters, found by some divining rod. 
<li n=?>Gush up to cool the parched brow, make glad the valley sod 
<li n=?>Give nurture to the waing grove, and blooming fragrance spread 
<li n=?>Aiound the path that beauty loves at even tide to tread. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>How many a flower of loveliness by nature's left alone, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>To add its sweetness to the air, from yonder cliff's high throne ; 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>How many a gem of brilliancy, new lustre that would give 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>To kingly crown or diadem, in cavern dim doth live, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>And waiteth but to answer back the torch's intruding ray, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Or flash and sparkle in the full and glowing blaze of day. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>They call me cold and passionless — because I will not bow 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>At beauty's shrine the stubborn knee, nor veil the careless brow ; 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Because my heart no altar is, whereon to sacrifice 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>To every lip where wreathed in smiles a subtle Cupid Ues, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>To every eye from which may gleam a passion-kindled glance.

<p>
<li n=?>To every form that gi-aceful floats adown the mazy dance.

<p>
<li n=?>Yet can I worship Woman with intensity of one 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Who feels her power, and boweth as the heathen to the sun — 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Who knows that life would be a cold, a dark and dreary night,

<p>
<li n=?>But that her smiles are round him warm — her presence ever bright; —

<p>
<li n=?>Who feels his soul would be like some unstrung and silent lyre,

<li n=?>Did not her breath awake its tones and every note inspire.

<p>
<li n=?>They call me cold and passionless — because they cannot read

<p>
<li n=?>In every changing lineament the foreshade of each deed ;

<h1>CHAPTER I. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>" CuESE the pale faces !" exclaimed a tall Indian who stood upon a ledge of rocks which jutted 
<li n=?>over a dark ravine, down which the mountain current whirled with the rapidity of an arrow, sound- 
<li n=?>ing like the deep and dull rumbling of distant thunder, and throwing up the spray in hazy wreaths 
<li n=?>which almost reached the ledge upon which the Indians stood. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Curse the pale faces ! dost thou think I can be subdued by the cubs whose dams I prostrated 
<li n=?>at my feet !" He who spoke was a tall Indian of a herculean mould, with a high and expansive 
<li n=?>forehead, and a pair of dark eyes, which glistened like the mountam tiger's as he spoke. His fea- 
<li n=?>tures were sharp and sternly set, while his shaggy eyebrows were natm-ally drawn down over his 
<li n=?>eyes, which gave to his features an ascetic expression not very prepossessing. The Indian to whom 
<li n=?>he addressed the expression, was a small man, with a narrow receding forehead, dark fieiy eyes, and 
<li n=?>a countenance the unnatural distortions of which, when he spoke, would lead a physiognomist into 
<li n=?>the mdubitable belief that this delectable individual might be one of that number whose qualms of 
<li n=?>conscience for evil deeds might be too frequent. The large Indian gritted his teeth as he finished 
<li n=?>speaking, and brandished his tomahawk towards fort Duquesne with a fearful vigor, which, with the 
<li n=?>dark scowl upon his face, caused the smaller Indian to recoil with fear. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" 'Tis even so," at length spoke the latter, in a dry guttural voice. " The cubs have grown in 
<li n=?>strength, till they have risen to sweep us from the earth ; already have they encroached into our 
<li n=?>hunting grounds, and om- game is daily becoming less beneath their fiery weapons." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Let them grow ! the taller the tree grows, the easier 'tis blown dowTi by the wind," said 
<li n=?>Pontiac, (for it was he,) who gazed so intently in the direction of fort Duquesne, as not to observe 
<li n=?>the countenance of the dwarf Pishairo, which assumed a sinister smile, while his small bright eyes 
<li n=?>glittered like the enraged snake when he watches in the grass for his prey. " 'Tis said the pale war- 
<li n=?>rior would wed the daughter of Pontiac ; has the news yet reached the ear of ovur sachem 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The sachem glared upon the dwarf as if he wonld fathom his inmost thoughts, while the 
<li n=?>bitter smile which had spread over his features suddenly passed off, and a demure composure was 
<li n=?>the only expression observable. " Hast thou been among the pale faces contrary to my wishes 1 if 
<li n=?>so, better hadst thou be a snake than Pishairo," said the chief sternly through his clenched teeth, as 
<li n=?>he continued gazing upon the countenance of the dwarf. " Speak ! how comest thou by this idle 
<li n=?>talk, which would better become one of thy own kind than me V 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" I have sought thee, Pontiac, for my breast is burdened with news. Listen ! As the sun was 
<li n=?>sinking behind the mountain, and ere the birds had ceased their warbling, I beheld the pale face in 
<li n=?>his canoe, which he plied silently, scarcely disturbing the dark shadows in the waters as he passed ; 
<li n=?>he landed, and with the stealthiness of the wild cat, when he crawls upon his prey, mounted he the 
<li n=?>green bank which rises by thy mountain wigwam ; he gained the top — a low cry, and thy dark-eyed 
<li n=?>daughter " 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The fierce sachem sprang upon his feet, and fixing his fiery eyes upon the dwarf, drew back 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>44 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>his long spear, as if in tHe act of hurling it, while the informant crouched clo^r to th rock beneath 
<li n=?>which he sat. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" When the Ottawa sachem discovers Pishairo's tongue forked lUie the subtle snake's, then let 
<li n=?>him strike the base blood from his heart," and the dwarf laid his hand upon his bosom, and gazed 
<li n=?>steadfastly upon the chief, who, after scrutinizmg his countenance, which was as expressionless as 
<li n=?>the cold marble, exclaimed in a voice of passion, " None of the pure blood of Pontiac shall mingle 
<li n=?>with the base blood of the pale face, unless it be in the struggle for life and death. I have said it ! 
<li n=?>Curse the white race ! Were I the father of a thousand daughters, whose eyes were as dark as the 
<li n=?>night, and whose hair were as beautiful as the raven's plumage, I would lay them all upon the dust 
<li n=?>and mingle their blood with the dirt ere it should mingle with that cursed race ! I will stand in 
<li n=?>their path, and stop their journey, or, upon the bones of my forefathers, perish," and the chief shook 
<li n=?>his spear with vehemence towards the dwarf. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" These were words of truth," assented the small man, who still lay close to the rock, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Pishairo speak," said the sachem in a peremptory tone, which was not to be disobeyed. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"The daughter of the Ottawa sachem gazed into the eyes of the pale face with those of the dove, 
<li n=?>and her voice was as soft as the nightingale when he sings to his love, as she whispered in a low 
<li n=?>voice, which reached my ear,' Thy canoe did not darken the waters last setting sun ; no ripple came 
<li n=?>to the shore from thy paddle; has the daughter of the Ottawa sachem grown cold in thine eye 1' 
<li n=?>Then spoke the pale faced chief, and his voice was like unto the silvery tones of the dark-eyed maiden, 
<li n=?>' The pale face loves the Ottawa maiden, but not for her lands — 'tis the maiden he wants, and he 
<li n=?>•would take her from this dreary forest to the bright land of his people— would the red maiden fol- 
<li n=?>low her pale lover 1' and he placed around her neck a chain made from the bright metal, as he drank 
<li n=?>from her glowing eyes the confession that she would be his own. In a mellow voice he bade her 
<li n=?>meet him at the next setting sun, and then his canoe went its noiseless way and soon disappeared ; 
<li n=?>these are not forked words." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The eyes of the chief flashed fire, he gritted his teeth, and clenched his spear with the power of 
<li n=?>a vice, but, with that tact peculiar to him, covered the fury which raged within him under features 
<li n=?>which indicated nothing more to an observer than their usual stern and determined expression. He 
<li n=?>strode off, and the features of the dwarf again assumed their usual cunning and sinister expression. 
<li n=?>The haughty Ottawa sachem had beheld with a jealous eye the daily encroachments of the white 
<li n=?>race upon the lands owned by his tribe. His foresight told him that the power which a while pre- 
<li n=?>viously was unlimited among the tribes, was daily becoming weaker — and he already viewed, in an- 
<li n=?>ticipation, the whites as masters of the land of his ancestors, unless he adopted vigorous measures to 
<li n=?>drive them from it ere they increased to such numbers as would render futile all his attempts to ex- 
<li n=?>pel them. Already had his name ceased to create that electric effect which it was wont ere the 
<li n=?>whites came to the country, and he determined, with one sanguinary blow, to regain that mighty 
<li n=?>influence which he had lost. He was determined that his voice should again be heard with rever- 
<li n=?>ence at the council fire, and that, vhen in his absence, his belt should summon a host of warriors 
<li n=?>to his standard, as it formerly did in the days of his glory. It is seldom we see one possessing power 
<li n=?>once, when levelled to the common standard of a private individual, who is willing to remain so ; 
<li n=?>but with the never-tiring and never-quietted passion ci'iilidon continually spurring him on, he is 
<li n=?>never satisfied, never at ease, but unceasingly engaged in plotting and counterplotting for the prize 
<li n=?>which can never be reached, till at last he expires, a victim to the passion which bums alike in the 
<li n=?>breast of the savage and the king. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Pontiac still possessed unlimited sway over his own nation — yet the influence of the whites was 
<li n=?>also felt among his own tribe ; they did not obey his wishes with the same alacrity as previous to 
<li n=?>the appearance of the whites on their soil. The dwarf, who belonged to the Peoria nation, whom 
<li n=?>the warlike Ottawas had conquered and reduced to slavery, was a soi-disant chief: but the fate of 
<li n=?>war had not only reduced him to a private individual, but also to a slave, in which capacity he 
<li n=?>served under the Ottawa sachem ; which, after all, was more compatible with his talent than his for- 
<li n=?>mer station, which was an hereditary gift. Love and jealousy are passions which rage in a savage 
<li n=?>with more energy than in a refined bieast, and these were at this time the two predominant passions 
<li n=?>of Pishairo. He had seen Pontiac's beautiful daughter, and to see was to love; he had gazed upon 
<li n=?>her till he was intoxicated with her charms ; long and ardently had he watched her expanding wo- 
<li n=?>manhood, and, like the rose bud, so beautiful at first, now that she had expanded to maturity, ap- 
<li n=?>peared more lovely still. This amiable lover had beheld the meeting of the preceding evening, and 
<li n=?>inflamed wiih jealousy, he sought the chief, whose irritable disposition he knew could be easily 
<li n=?>fanned into a flame, particularly when the subject was the white aggressors. His object for com- 
<li n=?>municating this intelligence was the reverse of what the chief supposed it, who imagined he had 
<li n=?>Mad the countenance of the dwarf.

<h1>CHAPTER II. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>As the trees were gilded with the last rays of the declining sun, a canoe silently glided towards 
<li n=?>the bank upon which stood the wigwam of the Ottawa chief. The person who sat in it, and noise- 
<li n=?>lessly plied the paddle, appeared to be aware of his proximity to the hunting ground of the Ottawas, 
<li n=?>by the many anxious looks which he directed to every tangled coppice which he passed. After re- 
<li n=?>viewing well the woods from the middle of the stream, he turned the prow towards the shore, and 
<li n=?>with one or two dips of his paddle, the canoe bounded to the land ; he sprang out, and drawing it 
<li n=?>farther upon the bank, stealthily walked up the hill, observing to examine the priming of his pis- 
<li n=?>tols, which he carried in his belt, previous to commencing the ascent. He gained the top, and 
<li n=?>■whistling softly, beheld the Ottawa maiden advancing from the direction of her father's wigwam. 
<li n=?>At this moment an Indian stepped from behind a tree near the white man. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Ah, Pishairo, thou art here agreeably to thy promise," exclaimed the white man, as he grasped 
<li n=?>the Indian's hand, " and thou hast talked with the sachem's daughter — how can I reward thee 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Reward !" exclaimed the dwarf, as his features assumed the sardonic expression peculiar to 
<li n=?>them when he was over excited. " Thinkest thou a Peoria sachem asks reward 1 he takes it." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" This language is enigmatical ; explain thyself, warrior," said the white man, whose face slightly 
<li n=?>reddened. " How couldst thou take thy reward unless I chose to give it " 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The dwarf burst out into a hysterical laugh. " Does the eagle ask the hawk for his prey " No ! 
<li n=?>he pounces upon him and takes him" — and the dwarf walked off laughing immoderately. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The white man gazed after him, but the Indian maiden was in his arms ere he could give vent 
<li n=?>to an expression of anger. He impiinted a kiss on her forehead, and his eyes immediately lost their 
<li n=?>expression of angei with which he gazed at the dwarf. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Is the Ottawa maiden ready to go to the land of the white man's people 1" 
<li n=?>The girl hung her head, and then looking him in the face with eyes beaming love, she answered, 
<li n=?>" The Ottawa maiden is ready to leave her people, and follow her white warrior to his bright land." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Then we will hasten ere '' and turning around, the white man beheld himself surrounded 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>with Indians, who stood as many as the trees. He seized the maiden with the left hand, and with his 
<li n=?>light drew a pistol, which he discharged at the nearest Indian ; they rushed on him, but with his 
<li n=?>knife, which he brandished in the air with herculean strength, he kept the wairiors at bay, and 
<li n=?>slowly retreated towards the boat ; thiice did they rush up, and thrice did he repel them ; but finally 
<li n=?>he was overpowered by the savages, thrown upon the ground, and bound. The maiden was led to 
<li n=?>her lodge, and the while man borne to the densest part of the woods, where were erected the tents 
<li n=?>of the warriors. He was taken to a spacious tent, in which sat Pontiac and all of his oldest chiefs. 
<li n=?>A low guttmal interjection from each man as he passed, indicated their knowledge of his capture ; 
<li n=?>and then all were as silent and motionless as statues. The sachem motioned with his hand, and 
<li n=?>the white man was untied, and stood amongst them. The chief arose to address him, and from a 
<li n=?>spark of joy which appeared to twinkle in his eyes, it was evident he was striving to master feelings 
<li n=?>of exultation, which were so intense as almost to overcome him. The white man folded his 
<li n=?>arms, and looked steadfastly in the eyes of Pontiac as he spoke ; and from the fearless man- 
<li n=?>ner in which he bore himself, it was evident that he could be no uncommon person. The 'sa- 
<li n=?>chem spoke slowly and distinctly, and his words embodied that sarcasm which strikes to the soul of 
<li n=?>the addressed. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" White man, listen ! The red man and the white man were friends ; they sat at the same coun- 
<li n=?>cil fire, and they slept upon the same blanket ; they walked the same path, and they smoked to- 
<li n=?>gether the same pipe ; they ate of the same venison, and there was peace ! White man, listen ! Ye 
<li n=?>grew in strength, (for then ye were weak) till, like the tall oak, ye fain would spread youi branches 
<li n=?>over the other trees, to guard them from the stoim ; ye are now grown high, but beware ! — none 
<li n=?>but the tallest trees are stricken by the fire of the clouds. (Every warrior grunted a commendation.) 
<li n=?>Ye grew in strength till the land which you hunted upon grew small in your eyes, and then ye 
<li n=?>would have ours. Ye taught our young warriors to drink the fire water, which drove them mad, and 
<li n=?>they were no longer warriors. Is this all ■ No ! Not content with oui lands, ye would steal upon 
<li n=?>our hunting grounds to carry off our daughter; what does the paleface merit" The sachem's 
<li n=?>eyes twinkled like two stars as he gazed around upon the rows of warriors. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Curse the wild cat ! he would prey upon his red brothers," said a clear eyed old warrior, whose 
<li n=?>scalp lock was blanched with years. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" And merits burning at the stake," said another, whose loclis were no less white. 
<li n=?>"And his bones cast to the dogs — curse him!" exclaimed a third. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Curse him !'' reiterated the rest in a low tone, as they involuntarily tightened their grasps 
<li n=?>around their tomahawk handles — " can the white chief find his tongue 1" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The prisoner already knew of the mighty scheme against the whites which the sachem wag pro- 
<li n=?>jecting by his dutiful slave Pishairo, and he felt that his only chance for life would be to obtain, if 
<li n=?>possible, a protraction of his execution. He spoke firmly and frankly, and admitted what they aU 
<li n=?>leady suspected. There was no cringing beneath the stern and steady gaze of Pontiac, but he threw 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>46 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>it back by one equally stern and defying ; he spoke with powerful energy, for he was pleading for 
<li n=?>life; he described in glowing colors the impression the first sight of his daughter had upon him, and 
<li n=?>that he was resolved to wed her in order to cement the bonds of friendship firmer between the white 
<li n=?>and red men, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A demoniacal smile spread over the features of the sachem when the white man had finished speak- 
<li n=?>ing ; he drew himself up to his full height, and fiercely demanded the war club — should be passed 
<li n=?>around, which was soon done, and it was decided that the prisoner should be burned at the stake the 
<li n=?>following morning. He was taken to a wigwam and firmly bound, and four lynx-eyed warriors 
<li n=?>were stationed over him, who had mingled their blood, and swore to take the life of any one of 
<li n=?>their number who should be so unfortunate as to fall asleep. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The prisoner was the young commander of Fort Duquesne, who had a short time previous left 
<li n=?>his native country, buoyant with hope, but in an unlucky moment beheld the pretty Indian maid- 
<li n=?>en, whose native charms captivated him. None of the Indians were aware of the rank of their pri- 
<li n=?>soner save Pontiac, and a very few of the veteran chiefs and warriors, who were all anxious for his 
<li n=?>death, more that the news might intimidate the soldiers of the fort, than for the heinousness of the 
<li n=?>crime of striving to steal a girl. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>About midnight, a messenger stood before the lodge of Pishairo, who was tossing about on his 
<li n=?>blanket, a prey to the burning thoughts which tortured his brain. The Indian tore away the rude 
<li n=?>screen from before the place of entrance, and bade the dwarf arise and proceed to the council house, 
<li n=?>whither he repaired instantly. Pontiac sat at the farther end of the house, and at each side of him 
<li n=?>four chiefs, whose hair were snowy with age, and like all grave counsellors, when on duty, they sat 
<li n=?>stem and motionless, with the exception of their lips, which slightly moved as the smoke from them 
<li n=?>curled in thick wreaths over their heads. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"Pishairo!" The dwarf stood motionless, in a listening attitude. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Pishairo has his ears sharpened," said he, in a firm tone. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Listen," said the sachem ; " travel with the wings of the dove to fort Duquesne, and bear its 
<li n=?>commanding chief this belt ; look upon it ! 'tis a broad one ! the wampum is red. It speaks of 
<li n=?>war ! Tell him the red men would have him leave his fort, and march his men from our soil ere to- 
<li n=?>morrow's sun climbs the sky, or their great chief, who is our prisoner, shall be burned at the stake. 
<li n=?>Listen ! tell him the red warriors await his answer, in numbers as many as the leaves upon the 
<li n=?>trees — hasten." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The aged chiefs granted an assent ; the dvrarf received the belt and departed. Ere he had pro- 
<li n=?>ceeded half a mile, a messenger overtook him, with orders from the sapient council to return. The 
<li n=?>dwaif measured the distance to the council house, and then turned back, and his eyes assumed a 
<li n=?>diabolical expression, and his eyes rolled with rage. The chiefs still occupied their seats, and ap- 
<li n=?>peared to take no farther notice of his return than by puffing larger volumes of smoke from their 
<li n=?>lips. Pontiac fixed his eyes upon the dwarf's countenance, and the gaze appeared to read the in- 
<li n=?>most thoughts which worked so wildly and energetically in his breast ; his own countenance was 
<li n=?>as unmoved and expressionless as if he slept. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Will the panther degrade himself and be a fox 1" at length the sachem thundered out. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The dwarf laid his hand on his heart, and then throwing out his arms, exclaimed, " If the Ottawa 
<li n=?>sachem thinks the panther could be a fox, let him treat him as one." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Fidehty lurks not in the fox, yet it is with the Peoria warrior, said an old counsellor. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Methinks Pishairo is no snake," grumbled another. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>A writhing smile played upon the sachem's face, as he respectfully nodded to the old men who 
<li n=?>spoke, and bade the dwarf depart, nor tarry on his way. 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>CHAPTER III. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>By day-break next morning, the warriors of the surrounding tribes poured in from all directions, 
<li n=?>till the woods were filled with them. The large council house was occupied by the old men, while 
<li n=?>the young warriors went through their war dance, and excited each other's passions with songs of 
<li n=?>the white aggressors, and tales of their own chivalrous feats. At the council, the Ottawa sachem 
<li n=?>exerted his talents with the most skilful success. With a profound knowledge of the character of 
<li n=?>the members of the several tribes who sat before him, he spoke words which, to them, were as fire ; 
<li n=?>nothing was left unsaid to arouse their passions against the whites. With oratorical powers, which 
<li n=?>could not be commanded by a white man, and an energy of gesture, which was natural, he painted 
<li n=?>in vivid colors to their imaginations, the usurpations of the white race since their arrival on the soil; 
<li n=?>how they had taken possession of their hunting grounds, and destroyed their game, and finally tried 
<li n=?>to steal away their children to make them slaves. He appealed to their prejudices and to their pas- 
<li n=?>sions ; and to render them more sanguine of success, promised them the assistance of the Great 
<li n=?>Spirit, who, he said, had visited him in a dream, and declared he would assist their cause, which was 
<li n=?>the holy one of freedom. The old waniors grasped their weapons, and, with suppressed interjections 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>

<p>
<li n=?>of rage, shook them in the air. During this excitement a small man entered, and took his way 
<li n=?>through the rows of warriors, till he stood before the orator. It was Pishairo ; he bore on the point 
<li n=?>of a long pole the war belt which he had received of Pontiac the previous evening; it was stripped 
<li n=?>of all its wampum, and was bare ! The sachem snatched it from the pole, and held it before the ex- 
<li n=?>cited members of the council, while his countenance was distorted with passion. The effect was in- 
<li n=?>stantaneous; the whole council arose with one burst of rage, and rushed out of the door, followed 
<li n=?>by Pontiac, who tore the belt to a thousand pieces, as he strode after them. The young warriors 
<li n=?>deserted the painted pole around which they danced, and with a wild yell crowded forward at the 
<li n=?>heels of the host which rushed forward with the irresistible impetus of the mountain torrent. They 
<li n=?>arrived at the wigvi^am where the prisoner lay, which they tore to pieces, and unbinding him, they 
<li n=?>bore him to the stake amid the deafening yells of the young warriors, while hundreds crowded in 
<li n=?>with arms full of dry faggots. The white man tried to speak, but his voice wSs drowned amid the 
<li n=?>loud curses of his enemies, whose fists and spear handles w-ere as busy as their tongues. His clothes 
<li n=?>were instantly torn from him in rags, and his body was painted black ; a buffalo thong was tied 
<li n=?>around his neck, and fastened to the stake, leaving a line long enough for him to move freely. The 
<li n=?>faggots were piled around at the distance of six feet, and a warrior stood with a torch to light them, 
<li n=?>when a shrill cry was heard, and the daughter of Pontiac sprang over the dry wood, and threw her- 
<li n=?>self upon the breast of her lover, which she clung to as a drowning man to a straw. The warriors 
<li n=?>looked upon this sight, which was so suddenly and unexpectedly presented them, with astonish- 
<li n=?>ment ; but there was no gaze of pity mingled with those looks — no compassion for her distress ; 
<li n=?>they curled their lips with rage, which soon broke out in yells of impatience. Pontiac drew back a 
<li n=?>moment with surprise, and then, with the fury of a demon, he grasped his tomahawk, and rushed 
<li n=?>upon his daughter to dash out her brains, when his arm was caught by Pishairo, the violent and se- 
<li n=?>cret lover of the maiden. With a thundering exclamation of contempt, the sachem seized the dwarf, 
<li n=?>as if he had been the smallest infant, and hurled him far over the heads of the warriors. The In- 
<li n=?>dian sprang upon his feet, and stung with rage, rushed at Pontiac, whom he reached in time to sus- 
<li n=?>pend a second blow, when a famous chief of another tribe interfered, and saved the life of the 
<li n=?>maiden. She was torn from the prisoner, and borne back to her wigwam ; the faggots were fired, 
<li n=?>and the dreadful work commenced. At this moment, a discharge of rifles burst upon the astonished 
<li n=?>warriors, and many of them were laid low with the dead ; but the rest, v.ho were excited to phren- 
<li n=?>zy, fought like lions. Before the English could load their guns, the Indians, led by Pontiac, were 
<li n=?>among them with the dreadful tomaliawk, which they wielded with their usual force and success. 
<li n=?>The battle was now hand to hand, and each man was engaged in a struggle which was for life or 
<li n=?>death. During this time, the Indian maiden rushed through the burning faggots and cut the cord 
<li n=?>which bound her lover, who joined his people, nov/ losing ground beneath the desperation of the In- 
<li n=?>dians. Long and deadly was the contest, but finally the' whites were forced to give way before the 
<li n=?>fury of the savages. They retreated with tolerable order, under the example of their naked and 
<li n=?>blackened commander, who had lost none of his bi avery with his clothes. They regained their boats, 
<li n=?>and after striving once more to gain an advantage, without success, paddled ofl', followed by the 
<li n=?>curses of the warriors, whose rage was none appeased b' being deprived of the consoling sight of a 
<li n=?>prisoner burnt at the stake. Pontiac mounted a log, and in a few moments succeeded in fanning 
<li n=?>their already excited passions to a furious flame, and then the whole savage host marched for Fort 
<li n=?>Duquesne, as the exciting war song, from a thousand voices, swelled upon the air. 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<h1>CHAPTER IV. </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>Among the warriors was a Chippewa chief, named Minavana, gifted with a powerful eloquence, 
<li n=?>which, with an indomitable disposition, rendered him a formidable rival of the Ottawa sachem. The 
<li n=?>Chippewas were at that time the strongest, with the single exception of the Oltawas, of the tribes 
<li n=?>inhabiting that vast wilderness stretching between the lakes and the Ohio river. This chief beheld, 
<li n=?>with a jealous eye, the ascending influence of the Ottawa sachem, whose power he iinagined was on 
<li n=?>the ebb, and with all the secret intrigue which he possessed, caballed against Pontiac. But these 
<li n=?>intrigues did not escape the wily sachem's notice, who, by means of some of the Chippewa's own 
<li n=?>warriors, received daily information of the progress of his plots. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The sun was high in the heavens, when the host of warriors reached a ravine, formed by a moun- 
<li n=?>tain torrent, which, for ages, had rolled down the path. Here they encamped for the night, and af- 
<li n=?>ter placing sentinels around the neighborhood of the camps, the Ottawa sachein took his spear, and 
<li n=?>strode up the mountain side. He went alone — there was no human being to whom he could com- 
<li n=?>municate his secret projects, for there was no red man whose mind appeared to him gigantic enough 
<li n=?>to share his ambitious schemes. He strode up the mountain, looking upon either side, as he held 
<li n=?>his spear ready to strike into any of the wild animals, which, at that time, inhabited the mountain- 
<li n=?>ous countries in great numbers. The sun was now sinking behind a bed of clouds at the far west 
<li n=?>the birds were singing their evening songs ; the wind was lulled to sleep, and even the stern sa' 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>48 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>chem's breast was influenced by the repose around him ; his fierce spirit was calmed, and as he sat 
<li n=?>on a high rock, overlooking the whole country, he reasoned dispassionately on the probable chance 
<li n=?>of his succeeding in his bold design of driving the whites from his country. " Then again," said he, 
<li n=?>" will I be the sole king of this broad and blooming hunting ground : there will be no white men to 
<li n=?>teach our warriors cowardice, nor to create dissatisfaction among our young men. All will be as it 
<li n=?>were in the olden times ere the pale faces visited our shores ; and when the sachem's runners were 
<li n=?>not treated with contempt." 'J'he sachem's voice sank lower, but he was so absorbed in his ambi- 
<li n=?>tious thoughts, as not to observe two individuals who stood upon a rock just above him. They 
<li n=?>gazed eagerly upon him, and then spoke earnebtly, but in a tone sufficiently low as not to reach the 
<li n=?>ear of the dreaded chief. The smaller warrior, who was the dwarf Pishairo, stealthily disappeared 
<li n=?>behind the rock ; the other, who was the Chippewa sachem Minavana, made a noise which attracted 
<li n=?>the attention of Pontiac, and then appeared to be looking in another direction, apparently uncon- 
<li n=?>scious of his proximity to the Ottawa. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The Chippewa sachem is a panther in the fight," said Pontiac, in a tone of commendation. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The Chippewa turned around, and, apparently surprised, saluted the sachem Vv'ith dignity and 
<li n=?>marked respect. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Would the sapient Pontiac practice his spesr upoii the heart of the bloody panther ere he plants 
<li n=?>it in the white man's 1" said the Chippewa, with a deferential inclination of the head, as he strode 
<li n=?>to the rock upon which sat the Ottawa. " I have sought thee eagerly ; the pale face warriors are 
<li n=?>upon our grounds, and our young warriors pant for battle — they want Pontiac." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The Ottawa sprang to his feet, and followed Minavana. They wound their way around huge 
<li n=?>rocks — now upon the edge of a frowning precipice, where one false step would hurl them to atoms, 
<li n=?>and then at the bottom, where rocks rose above them, like the towers of some tremendous castle ; 
<li n=?>but they trod their way with a precision which could not be learned but by one who had spent years 
<li n=?>among the mountains. They finally reached a deep ravine, half way to the encampment of the In- 
<li n=?>dian army. The rocks rose high on each side, leaving a space between them of but a few feet. The 
<li n=?>Ottawa walked some distance before, wholly occupied in anticipating the battle, in which he hoped 
<li n=?>to be a formidable participator; while walking, he heard a voice, and turning around, the Chippewa 
<li n=?>chief was no where to be seen ; but in the gloom of the evening, he beheld a party of his warriors, 
<li n=?>armed alone with knives; they slowly advanced, dispersing, apparently with a view of taking him 
<li n=?>alive. The Ottawa hurled his spear in the breast of one, and, with his war cry, attacked them witli 
<li n=?>a fury which was irresistible ; he broke through them, and leaving four of their number dead, bound- 
<li n=?>ed down the mountain side; a shrill yell before him, by its peculiar tone, informed him a Chippewa 
<li n=?>was near ; he drew his knife, aud bounded forward — the sachem Minavana stood before him, 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Curse thy false heart, Chippewa, thou art a squaw !" and with one jump, they stood facing each 
<li n=?>other, their eyes gleaming hate, and their lips curled with the scorn with which they pretended to 
<li n=?>view each other. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Thou art but a little girl, Ottawa, when the Chippewa sachem stands before thee," and with 
<li n=?>these approbious epithets, they fought with fury. Their physical powers were well matched, but 
<li n=?>the dread in which the Chippewa held Pontiac, might have weakened his energies, and he appeared 
<li n=?>to quail beneath the glare of the Ottawa's eye ; but he fought with the desperation which his situ- 
<li n=?>ation required. They were now locked in each other's firm embrace, and, after writhing awhile, 
<li n=?>they fell from the rock upon which they fought, upon a ledge a few feet below. They sprung upon 
<li n=?>their feet, and stood a moment to regain energy for their last struggle. They viewed each other 
<li n=?>with gestures of scorn. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The Ottawa squaw can't fight — his arms are too weak," panted the Chippewa in a contemp- 
<li n=?>tuous tone, while he knew he had been worsted in the scuffle. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The Chippewa is a fox, he is unworthy to live among warriors," oiied the other, and with 
<li n=?>drawn knives they again rushed' at each other ; and the Chippewa, who was the most excited by the 
<li n=?>other's taunting language, threw himself off his guard, and received the Ottawa's knife, which pene- 
<li n=?>trated to his heart. Pontiac tore from his head the scalp, and went his way to the camp. The war 
<li n=?>song rang upon his ear, and the young warriors were dancing around the painted war pole, while 
<li n=?>the old men had already assembled in the council house, and with impatience awaited the presence 
<li n=?>of their sachems. Pontiac entered with the reeking scalp of Minavana in his hand ; he took his sta- 
<li n=?>tion at the head of the council house, and held up before them the scalp, from which yet dropped 
<li n=?>the warm blood. The house was now full to overflowing ; the young warriors had ceased their 
<li n=?>dance, and repaired to the council en masse to hear of the next day's operation ; every wigwam was 
<li n=?>deserted, and all the warriors choked up that spacious yet temporary house, till there was not room 
<li n=?>for one more spectator. With his usual strength of voice, the Ottawa sachem recounted to the listen- 
<li n=?>ing multitude the manner in which he had procured the scalp he held before them. In the most 
<li n=?>glowing colors he depicted to them the struggle he had to save his life, which he declared was va- 
<li n=?>lueless to himself, but of infinite value to his nation at this critical moment. He shook the scalp in

<p>
<li n=?>At this moment, when all was excitement, the dwarf Pishairo stepped before Pontiac,and after 
<li n=?>eyeing him for a moment, came closer to him, as if to impart an important secret. The sachem 
<li n=?>stooped down in a listening posture; the dwarf suddenly drew a knife and stuck it to the handle in 
<li n=?>his breast — the blade pierced the heart of Pontiac ! he sank upon the earth and died ; the mighty 
<li n=?>Pontiac, whose name carried terror even among the whites, expired at the feet of his base slave, the 
<li n=?>dwarf Pishairo. A loud burst of rage rang from the lips of every warrior present, who rushed up, 
<li n=?>and seizing the murderer, bore him from the council house ; they no longer thought of their chief, their 
<li n=?>whole thoughts were completely absorbed with revenge. They carried the traitor into an open space, 
<li n=?>and by piece-meal, they cut his flesh from his body. The wretch was one hour expiring. Their re- 
<li n=?>venge satiated, they returned to their fallen sachem, who lay upon the ground dead and stiff". They 
<li n=?>all silently gathered around, wrapped in profound and solemn thought, for now their rage had passed 
<li n=?>away. Long did they stand and silently gaze upon the marble features of him, whose frown could 
<li n=?>have awed so many. At length a chief arose, his hair was as white as the driven snow, and his once 
<li n=?>powerful frame was bent with years ; his voice trembled with age and emotion as he spoke, and he 
<li n=?>was listened to with reverential attention. He recanted the bold exploits of the fallen lion who was 
<li n=?>at their feet, and he dwelt long upon his virtues, which were as many and as bright as the dew-drops 
<li n=?>upon the leaves. The impression could not be resisted even by the stoical warriors ; the large tear- 
<li n=?>drops trickled down their cheeks despite their efforts to conceal them, as they looked upon all that 
<li n=?>remained of Pontiac, the last of the Ottawa sachems. And well might they weep ! for the gigantic 
<li n=?>mind, which kept their tribe to its pinnacle of power, had departed forever !

<li n=?>to be found, and they finally concluded she had followed her father to the " great hunting grounds 
<li n=?>far away to the rising sun." At length she was discovered — she was the wife of the young com-

<h1>REFLECTIONS IN A COUNTRY GRAVE YARD. </h1>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>Come, let us recline awhile beneath the wide-spreading branches of this ancient pine, and steal 
<li n=?>from the busy hours a few moments for wholesome meditation. Around us are reposing, in the 
<li n=?>calm tranquillity of dreamless sleep, the friends of our childhood — the beloved of our liper years. A 
<li n=?>holy melancholy, a subdued sorrow, rests with brooding wings upon this solemn bourne. These 
<li n=?>pale violets mark the hallowed spot where slumbers the young mother's darling — the proud father's 
<li n=?>hope. Tears, pure as parental love, have bedewed their opening buds — tears prompted by aflection 
<li n=?>so deep and true that the pure offering has found acceptance in the sight of Him, and a sweet and 
<li n=?>tranquil sorrow steals o'er the hearts of the youthful mourners, purifying and preparing them for 
<li n=?>the solemn change that awaits all mortality. Yon marble column glancing in the sunlight, a sculp- 
<li n=?>tured wreath encircling its cleft brow, tells us of the deep-springing affection of years by thy hand 
<li n=?>severed, oh ! death — of kind tones hushed — of the young household desolate — of the prattling cry 
<li n=?>of laughing infants for their dear mother's voice and smile stilled. The wife, the mother, rests be- 
<li n=?>neath. Mark that venerable monument, by wind-reft pines and time-worn oaks o'ershadowed ! Let 
<li n=?>us, with reverential step, approach and gaze upon its solemn face ! No more is heard the voice of 
<li n=?>admonition, or of calm advice. No more the joyous grand-children climb about grand-pa's knees, 
<li n=?>and shout with merry hearts at his jokes, or weep with breasts o'ercharged with sympathetic grief, 
<li n=?>while breathless listening to the old man's legendary tales. No more beside the cheerful hearth is 
<li n=?>seen that venerable form — that noble brow — those silvered locks. The old man here from his labor 
<li n=?>rests, and his fond family know him no more. Turn we to this simple slab of modest gray ; no 
<li n=?>name — no date proclaims who rests beneath. These deep-hewn lines will tell, perhaps, the story 
<li n=?>of his life.

<li n=?>monious hymnings '! And thou ! man ! whose mortality rests at my feet — thou, alone, had'st no

<li n=?>worm, if thou did'st feel not the immortal spirit within thee, like the imprisoned bird, beat at the

<li n=?>midnight hours. Then, when the listening spirit may almost hear the stately music of the revolv- 
<li n=?>ing spheres, 'tis thus she speaks — " Oh, Present! why, with fleet step and agitated mien, speed'st 
<li n=?>thou onward to thy bourne  That which I was, thou art — what I am, thou shalt become. The 
<li n=?>doom is on thee, and thou can'st not wander from the one path. Why, then, oh why, by the silent

<li n=?>haunts, or in pleasure's lighted halls. And I will tell thee, oh ! Present, that thou art but a shadow — 
<li n=?>the shadow of the future, as I was of thee. Thou can'st not attain the real or the permanent with 
<li n=?>all thy strugglings. They appertain unto the Future. Let this solemn truth arrest thy anxious 
<li n=?>steps ! Cease to seek that which thou can'st not find, and suffer thyself silently to be borne on the 
<li n=?>calm waters of hope to the bosom of thy destiny. With liberal hand and thankful heart, pluck the 
<li n=?>sweet-scented flowers around thee springing, and let their fragrance sooth thee to rest. A happy

<h1>TAIIIOUS IMPLEMENTS AND THEIR USE. </h1>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>The use of the bow is of remote antiquity — its obvious simplicity of construction, as well as the 
<li n=?>purposes to which it is adapted, having rendered its employment almost universal from the very ear- 
<li n=?>liest periods of which we have any distinct account. But we do not wish to trouble our readers with 
<li n=?>a disquisition upon its ancient history. It was originally formed, no doubt, of the rough bough of a 
<li n=?>tree, but improvements would be almost immediately discovered. The simple branch would speedily 
<li n=?>be rendered more convenient by a little cutting, so as to make the curve regular on both sides of the 
<li n=?>centre. Homer tells us how the bow of Pandarus was fashioned — 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>He heard, and madly at the motion pleased, 
<li n=?>His polished bow with hasty rashness seized. 
<li n=?>'Twas formed of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil; 
<li n=?>A mountain goat resigned the shining spoil. 
<li n=?>Who, pierced long since, beneath his arrows bled ; 
<li n=?>The stately quarry on the cliff lay dead. 
<li n=?>And sixteen palms his brows' large honors spread ; 
<li n=?>The workmen joined and shaped the bended horns, 
<li n=?>And beaten gold each taper point adorns. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Herodotus says that the bows of the Ethiopians were four cubits, or not less than six feet long. 
<li n=?>The Grecian bow is said to have been of the figure of their own letter sigma. The Scythian bow 
<li n=?>was somewhat of the same form. The bows used by the Daci were made in a very beautiful curve. 
<li n=?>It has been supposed that the Romans introduced the bow into Britain, or at least very much im- 
<li n=?>proved those which they found in use among the natives, and in course of time it became the national 
<li n=?>weapon of the class of inhabitants called yeomen. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>But the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes were certainly well acquainted with the use of the bow; a 
<li n=?>knowledge they derived at an early period from their progenitors. The Scandinavian Scalds, speak- 
<li n=?>ing in praise of the heroes of their countiy, frequently add to the rest of their acquirements a supe- 
<li n=?>riority of skill in handling the bow. It does not, however, appear that this skill was extended be- 
<li n=?>yond the purpose of procuring food, or for pastime, either by the Saxons or by the Danes, in times 
<li n=?>anterior to the conquest. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Representations of the bow occur frequently in the Saxon MSS. The cut annexed, taken from 
<li n=?>a manuscript of the tenth century found in the Cotton Library, gives the figure of a Saxon bow and 
<li n=?>arrow. The bow is curiously ornamented, having the head and tail of a serpent carved at the ends ; 
<li n=?>and was probably such an one as was used by the nobility. In all these old Saxon bows we may 
<li n=?>observe one thing remarkable, that is, the string not being made fast to the eitremities, but permitted

<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>It is well known that the Normans used the bow as a military weapon; and, under their govern- 
<li n=?>ment, the practice of archery was not only much improved, but generally diffused throughout the 
<li n=?>kingdom. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In the ages of chivalry the usage of the bow was considered as an essential part of the education 
<li n=?>of a young man who wished to make a figure in life. The heroes of romance are therefore usually 
<li n=?>praised for their skill in archery ; and Chaucer, with propriety, says of sir Thopas, " He was a good 
<li n=?>archere." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In the seventeenth century archery was much commended as an exercise becoming a gentleman 
<li n=?>to practice, and greatly conducivp to health. The ladies also were foud of this amusement. It was 
<li n=?>usual, when they exercised the bow, for the beasts to be confined by very large enclosures, sur- 
<li n=?>rounded by the hunters, and driven in succession from the covers to the stands, where the fair sports- 
<li n=?>women were placed ; so that they might readily shoot at them, without the trouble and fatigue of 
<li n=?>rousing and pursuing them. It is said of Margaret, the daughter of Henry the Seventh, that when, 
<li n=?>she was on her way towards Scotland, a hunting party was made for her amusement in Alnwick 
<li n=?>Park, where she killed a buck with an arrow. It is not specified whether the long-bow or the cross- 
<li n=?>bow was used by the princess upon this occasion ; we are certain, that the ladies occasionally shot 
<li n=?>with both, for when queen Elizabeth visited lord Montecute at Cowdrey, in Sussex, on the Monday, 
<li n=?>"Her highness tooke horse, and rode into the park, at eight o'clock in the morning, where was a 
<li n=?>delicate bowre prepared, under the which were her highness musicians placed ; and a cross-bow, by 
<li n=?>a nympth, with a sweet song, was delivered into her hands, to shoote at the deere ; about some thirty 
<li n=?>in number were put into a paddock, of which number she killed three oi four, and the countess of 
<li n=?>Kildare one." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The foregoing observations refer chiefly to the lo7ig-how, so called, to distinguish it from the 
<li n=?>arbalisi, or a-oss-bow, which was not only much shorter than the former, but fastened also upon a 
<li n=?>stock, and discharged by the means of a catch or trigger, which probably gave rise to the lock upon 
<li n=?>the modern musket. We cannot pretend to determine at what period the cross-bow was first brought 
<li n=?>into England, but we believe not long before the commencement of the thirteenth century ; at least, 
<li n=?>we never meet with any representation of such an engine prior to that period. On the continent, 
<li n=?>where probably it originated, its appearance might be somewhat earlier. Historians assure us, that 
<li n=?>Richard the First was wounded by an arrow from a bow of this kind, while he was reconnoitering 
<li n=?>the walls of the castle of Chalezun ; which wound was the occasion of his death. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The courage, discipline, strength and skill, displayed by British bowmen, during a period of 
<li n=?>more than six centuries, are so much a matter of ordinary history that it is hardly necessary to enlarge 
<li n=?>upon them here. In all the expeditions of which they formed a part, they proved to their adversa- 
<li n=?>ries a terror and a scourge. Even the bare appearance of a body of English archers in the field, often 
<li n=?>led to a bloodless victory ; and, as experience had proVed that the best armor was no protection against 
<li n=?>their arrows, their bold and confident spiiit often led them into very unequal contests. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Secured in their position by an ingenious mode of fortification, — the materials for which each 
<li n=?>archer carried on his person, — the English bowmen laughed to scorn the fiercest charges of the steel- 
<li n=?>clad chivalry of the middle ages. Of all the European nations, none suffered more severely, or more 
<li n=?>requently, from the effects of their archery than the French. Like the Italians, when invaded by the 
<li n=?>Huns, — another nation of formidable bowmen, — they composed a mass, expressly depreciating the 
<li n=?>calamities it inflicted upon them : — " Ab AngUcorum nos defendejacidls /" — " From the arrows of 
<li n=?>the English, defend us, O Lord !" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The ancient legislators, ever on the watch to encourage and enforce the practice of this art, once 
<li n=?>the sole guardian of the national independence, passed many judicious laws to prevent its falling into 
<li n=?>disuse. By these, a fine of one mark was levied on every master of a family who permitted any of 
<li n=?>his male inmates to be without a bow and three shafts, for the space of a month.* The local autho-

<p>

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>rities were required to superintend the erection of public butts, in the environs of every town and 
<li n=?>village. Many of their ancient positions are yet known, however different the uses to which the 
<li n=?>ground where they once stood, is at present applied. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The nobility and spiritual persons were, by law, excepted ; but men of every other rank and calling 
<li n=?>assembled, at these public shooting-grounds, to ply the sturdy yew and gallant gray goose wing. 
<li n=?>Thither the lordly baron sent his feudal vassals ; thither came the squire, the independent franklyn, 
<li n=?>the wealthy yeoman, the lude peasant, and the unwashed artizan. All formed one promiscuous 
<li n=?>multitude, of which the numbers, in populous districts, were so considerable that, after the first season, 
<li n=?>the grass never grew around these public marks. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The sabbaths and other holidays vi'ere appropriated, by the statute, for these exercises of archery. 
<li n=?>But our British progenitors, enthusiastically attached to their favorite weapon, rendered all penal 
<li n=?>enactments, for a series of ages, unnecessary. The intervals of labor were all devoted to the shoots 
<li n=?>ing-giound, and their bows and arrows accompanied them in every excursion. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The extreme range of a flight shaft, when discharged from one of their ancient bows, is stated to 
<li n=?>have been four hundred yards, or nearly one quarter of a mile.-j- At about a fourth of this distance, 
<li n=?>the war arrow would penetrate any ordinary breast-plate, and slay man or hoise at little short of 
<li n=?>two-thirds of it. To maintain and promote this strong and vigorous shooting, the statute of the 
<li n=?>33d of Henry the Eighth forbade any man, above the age of foui-and- twenty, to use the lighter kind 
<li n=?>of arrows, unless the butts were upwards of two hundred and twenty yards apart. After the pro- 
<li n=?>mulgation of this law, the strong and dexterous archers frequently increased the distance, of their 
<li n=?>own accord, to two hundred and forty yards. The practice is alluded to by Shakspeare, who, beyond 
<li n=?>all question, was not only a bowman, but an accomplished one. A contempt for mediocrity is one 
<li n=?>of the characteristics of genius. The pursuits of his juvenile days — for we have all read of his moon- 
<li n=?>light excursions to Charlecot Deer-Park, — the law of the land, which permitted no youth of his age 
<li n=?>and rank to remain one month without a bow and shafts — are sufficient evidence ; and, if more were 
<li n=?>wanting, we have it under his own hand. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Burke once playfully observed — and the pointed sally is characteristic of that great man — th^t 
<li n=?>fox-hunting formed nf ui mportant balance of the British constitution. His meaning is sufficiently 
<li n=?>obvious. The chase, oy bringing the aristocracy into familiar contact with the gentry and middle 
<li n=?>classes of society, broke down the bar of exclusiveness, and led to a mutual interchange of good 
<li n=?>offices, socially, and in many instances, poUtically advantageous to each. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" And surely" — says a very agreeable writer, and one evidently well conversant with the sub- 
<li n=?>ject — " the praise of these excellent qualities belongs more especially to modern archery. No visi- 
<li n=?>tant of the splendid bow-meetings which each revolving summer recals into existence, throughout the 
<li n=?>sylvan glades of this romantic land, ever remained uninfluenced by the joyous hilarity, the delight- 
<li n=?>ful ease and freedom which light each countenaKce with smiles. There, where men of various ranks,

<li n=?>It is to the good sense and discernment of the ' Woodmen of the Forest of Aiden' that we owe, 
<li n=?>in modern times, the introduction of the bow, as a suitable and healthful recreation for their fair

<p>
<li n=?>The History of the Navy of the United States of America. By J. Fenimore Cooper. Lea and 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Blanchard, Philadelphia. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In appealing before the public with this History of our Navy, Mr. Cooper has had two serious 
<li n=?>difficuUies to surmount — one of prejudice, and one of exaggerated anticipation. It cannot be denied 
<li n=?>that, for many years past, he has been rapidly sinking in the estimation of his countrymen, and in- 
<li n=?>deed of all right minded persons. Even his firmest friends were becoming ashamed of the univer- 
<li n=?>sality of his cynicism ; and his enemies, ceasing in a measure from open hostility, have been well 
<li n=?>content to abide the apparently inevitable self-ruin which his own unconquerable ill temper was so 
<li n=?>speedily bringing about. A flashy succession of ill-conceived and miserably executed literary pro- 
<li n=?>ductions, each more silly than its predecessor, and wherein the only thing noticeable was the pee- 
<li n=?>vishness of the writer, the only thing amusing his self-conceit — had taught the public to suspect even 
<li n=?>a ladical taint in the intellect, an absolute and irreparable mental leprosy, rendering it a question 
<li n=?>whether he ever would or could again accoinplish any thing which should be worthy the attention 
<li n=?>of people not positively rabid. In this state of affairs, it was not ut all wonderful that the announce- 
<li n=?>ment of a Naval History of the United States, by the author of the attack upon Sir Walter Seott, 
<li n=?>was received with apathy and general distrust — with a feeling very different indeed from that which 
<li n=?>would have agitated the whole reading world at a similar announcement during the golden days of 
<li n=?>the celebrated novelist, and once exceedingly popular man. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Among the few, on the other hand, who had better opportunities of penetrating the mystery, and 
<li n=?>fathoming the extent, of that obstinate disease of the spleen which had so long made the author a 
<li n=?>burden to himself, and an object of compassion to his friends — among those who knew the disorder 
<li n=?>not altogether incurable, and who had good reason to rely firmly upon the innate vigor and elastici- 
<li n=?>ty of the constitution — even among these we have noticed a want of proper consideration in regard 
<li n=?>to the subject matter of the anticipated work — a misconception of the extent and capacities of the 
<li n=?>theme — which has operated to the temporary disadvantage of the historian. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Mr. Cooper's strength in sea narrative was well known, and justly appreciated ; and in a work 
<li n=?>on Naval Histoiy, much was expected of a character very similar to that which had afforded its 
<li n=?>charm to the " Pilot," and rivetted attention in the " Red Rover." This expectation would have 
<li n=?>been comparatively well founded had the announcement been that of a Naval Biography, Here, an 
<li n=?>allowable minuteness of detail would have given vigor and vitality to the narration, and the person- 
<li n=?>al adventures of the several heroes would have been overspread, in the simple discussion of fact 
<li n=?>with all the warm hues of the most spirit-stirring romance. In no general naval record, however, 
<li n=?>should we look too confidently for interest, beyond that grave species which is attached to the mere 
<li n=?>statement of fact. In records of our own marine, especially, we should look for little farther than 
<li n=?>this. The story of the simple events of our expeiience (for we are a nation of single ships) must 
<li n=?>always be deficient in that excitement which is derivable from the unity and majesty of the combined 
<li n=?>operations of fleets. Here then our sea-history labors under disadvantages not experienced by that 
<li n=?>of Europe. The tales we have to tell, of detached combat after combat, can form, at best, but a series 
<li n=?>of monotonous episode, where if the mind seeks, as it will, for connexion, this can only be establish- 
<li n=?>ed by means of a diy and barren mass of documental and statistical detail. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, (whose importance we have by no means adequately 
<li n=?>pointed out) Mr. Cooper has succeeded in writing a book which cannot fad to do him lasting honor, 
<li n=?>not more in a literary point of view, than as affording evidence of the final triumph of his kindlier 
<li n=?>and more manly feelings over the promptings of Satan and the spleen. The very preface is redolent 
<li n=?>of a returning good humor — of a recovered modesty — of a resuscitated common sense. Mr. Cooper 
<li n=?>is evidently Mr. Cooper once again, and as such we most cordially welcome him home to the good 
<li n=?>XT ill, and to the affections, of his countrymen. That he, in preference to any one, should have writ- 
<li n=?>ten the Naval History of the United States, is a matter about which there is but little difference of 
<li n=?>opinion; and we rejoice, from the bottom of our heart, that he has arisen to the good work, from the 
<li n=?>moral death which has so long enwrapped him, while it is yet a convenient season for the under- 
<li n=?>taking — ^before the veteran actors in the drama have all passed away from among us — while there is 
<li n=?>yet many a tongue to tell what the eyeshave seen — many a living witness to the gallant and glorious 
<li n=?>exploits which have had so much to do in the rendering us, and in the preserving us, a free people.

<h1>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 57 </h1>
<p>
<li n=?>It is not our design, of course, to speak at length of any portion of a History which will speak scr 
<li n=?>very eloquently for itself. The narrative commences with the first settlement by the English, pro- 
<li n=?>ceeds with some details respecting the earliest achievements of the rival French and British colonies, 
<li n=?>connected with a clear and rapid survey of the condition of the maritime powers of Europe, and 
<li n=?>after discussing, in a masterly manner, every momentous event in the annals of our Navy, terminates 
<li n=?>•with the contest of 1812. The war of the Revolution is brought to a close about the middle of the 
<li n=?>first volume, and the more important subsequent occurrences occupy the lemainder of the publication. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The work, as a whole, has, wc think, all the great requisites of a proper History — distinctness of 
<li n=?>narration, rigorous impartiality, an evident anxiety for truth, and a concise philosophical discussion 
<li n=?>of fact, rather than a shadowy speculation upon motive. Every similar book, as a matter of course, 
<li n=?>is liable to objection — to cavil — in regard to its detail ; and, in the present case, we have heard oc- 
<li n=?>casional censures upon which we scarcely think it necessary to comment. Battles, whether by sea 
<li n=?>or land, (and battles form our staple here) are seldom witnessed by distinct authorities from the same 
<li n=?>points of observation, and this fact alone is sufficient to account for a thousand immaterial discre- 
<li n=?>pancies. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In legard to style, let us hear Mr. Cooper himself. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Some of the greatest writers of the age have impaired the dignity of their works, by permitting 
<li n=?>the peculiarities which have embelllslied their lighter labors to lessen the severity of manner that 
<li n=?>more properly distinguishes narratives of truth. This danger has been foreseen in the present in- 
<li n=?>stance, though the nature of the subject, which seldom rises to the level of general history, affords a 
<li n=?>constant temptation to offend. A middle course has been adopted, which, it is hoped, while some 
<li n=?>defects of execution may probably be detected, will be found on the whole to be suited to a recital of 
<li n=?>facts, in the familiar form that, in a measure, the incidents have demanded." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The mere English of our author was never, at any period, remarkable for precision of arrange- 
<li n=?>ment, and however easily, in a work of pure romance, such defect may be disregarded, we must own 
<li n=?>that it derogates very materially from the beauty of an otherwise excellent historic style. In the 
<li n=?>volumes before us sentences occur, by far too frequently, where positive ambiguity arises from sheer 
<li n=?>negligence in regard to the ordinary proprieties of grammar. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Republicanism itself is brought into disrepute, in denying the just rewards of long services to 
<li n=?>officers, by attaching to it the weakness of a neglect of incentives, an ignorance on the subject of the 
<li n=?>general laws of discipline, and the odium of injustice. It is by forgetting the latter quality, more 
<li n=?>through the indifference of a divided power, than from any other cause, that republics have obtained 
<li n=?>their established character of being ungrateful." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Here is great confusion of expression. By '' the latter quality" justice is intended, while 2<li n=?>jus- 
<li n=?>tice is implied. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" A territorial aristocracy, promotion, in both the army andthenav', is the inevitable fruit of favor, 
<li n=?>or of personal rank." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>This sentence, as it stands, is utterly unintelligible, and can only be comprehended at all by placing 
<li n=?>before it the words immediately antecedent — which are " The nature of the English government is 
<li n=?>no secret." It now appears that the English government is " a territorial aristocracy." But every 
<li n=?>properly constructed sentence should have within itself the means of its own (grammatical) compre- 
<li n=?>hension. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The man who, refusing to adopt remedies that he believes unsuited to his constitution, is dis- 
<li n=?>creet, when he carries his system so far as to forget to look for others to supply their places, becomes 
<li n=?>careless and culpable." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>This exceedingly ambiguous proposition is rendered perfectly plain by merely a different arrange 
<li n=?>ment of the same words. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" The man who is discreet in refusing to adopt remedies that he believes unsuited to his constitu- 
<li n=?>tion, becomes careless and culpable when he carries his system so far as to forget to look for others 
<li n=?>to supply their places." But upon this topic quite enough has been said. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Mr. Cooper's observations on the subject of our general marine policy are, v/e think, among the 
<li n=?>very best portions of his book. They are strikingly comprehensive in view, and evince a profound 
<li n=?>knowledge of the true incentives of human action. Our limits will permit us to give but a small por- 
<li n=?>tion of his remarks. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>"A careful review of these facts and principles must satisfy all who study the subject, that the 
<li n=?>United States of America have never resorted to the means necessary to dovelope, or even in a limit- 
<li n=?>ed sense, to employ their own naval resources. As a consequence, they have never yet enjoyed the 
<li n=?>advai^tage of possessing a powerful marine in time of war, or have felt its influence in sustaining 
<li n=?>their negotiations, and in supporting their national rights in a time of peace. As yet the ships of 
<li n=?>America have done little more than show the world what the republic might do with its energies duly 
<li n=?>directed, and its resources properly developed, by demonstrating the national aptitude for this species 
<li n=?>of warfare. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" But the probationary period of the American marine is passing away, and the body of the peo- 
<li n=?>ple are beginning to look forward to the appearance of their fleets on the ocean. It is no longer 
<li n=?>thought there is an unfitness in the republic's possessing heavy ships ; and the opinion of the country 
</p>
<li n=?>
<li n=?>
<p>
<li n=?>in this, as in other respects, is slowly rising to the level of its wants. Still many lingering prejudices 
<li n=?>remain in the public mind, in connexion with this all important subject, and some that threaten the 
<li n=?>service with serious injury. Of these, the most prominent are, the mode in which the active vessels 
<li n=?>are employed ; a neglect of the means of creating seamen for the public service ; the fact that there 
<li n=?>is no force in commission on the Ameiican coast; the substitution of money for pride and self-respectj 
<li n=?>^s the aim of military men ; and the impairing of discipline, and lessening the deference for the jusr 
<li n=?>tice of the state, by the denial of rank. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Undei the present system of employing the public vessels, none of the peculiar experience that 
<li n=?>belongs to the higher objects of the profession is obtained. While ships may be likened to regiments 
<li n=?>as regards the necessity of manoeuvring together, there is one important feature in which they are 
<li n=?>totally dissimilar. It may be pretty safely thought that one disciplined regiment will march as far, 
<li n=?>«adure as much, and occupy its station as certainly as another, but no such calculation can be made 
<li n=?>■an ships. The latter are machines, and their qualities may be improved by human ingenuity, when 
<li n=?>their imperfections have been ascertained by experiment. Intelhgent comparisons are the first step 
<li n=?>m this species of improvement. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>*' It will be clear to the dullest mind, that the evolutions of a fleet, and, in a greater or less degree. 
<li n=?>Its success, must be dependent on the qualities of its poorest vessels ; since its best cannot abandon 
<li n=?>their less fortunate consorts to the enemy. The naval history of the world abounds with instances^ 
<li n=?>in which the efforts of the first sea-captains have been frustrated by the defects of a portion of the 
<li n=?>ships under their command. To keep a number of vessels in compact order, to cause them to prer 
<li n=?>serve their weatherly position in gales and adverse winds, and to bring them all as near as possible 
<li n=?>up to the standard that shall be formed by the most judicious and careful commander, is one of the 
<li n=?>iiighest aims of naval experience. On the success of such eflorts depend the results of naval evolu- 
<li n=?>tions more frequently than on any dexterity in fighting guns. An efficient fleet can no more be 
<li n=?>formed without practice in squadrons, than an efficient army without evolutions in brigades. By not 
<li n=?>keeping ships in squadrons, there will also be less emulation, and consequently less improvement. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>" Under the present system three principal stations aie maintained ; two in the Atlantic, and one 
<li n=?>in the Mediterranean. On neither of these stations would the presence of a vessel larger than a sloop 
<li n=?>of war be necessary, on ordinary occasions, provided a force of heavy ships could periodically and un- 
<li n=?>expectedly appear on all. It is seldom that a single ship of the line is required on any sei-vice; and 
<li n=?>it is ceitain that a solitary two-decked vessel could have no great influence on those important in- 
<li n=?>terests which it is the practice of the rest of Christendom to refer to the agency of fleets. By putting 
<li n=?>in commission six or eight two-decked ships, and by causing them to appear, from time to time, on 
<li n=?>all the more important stations this side of the two great southern capes, the country, at no material 
<li n=?>additional cost, would obtain the several objects of practice in fleets, of comparative trials of the 
<li n=?>qualities of the most important class of vessels in the navy, of a higher state of discipline, and of a 
<li n=?>vast improvement in the habits of subordination on the part of commanders, a defect that all expe* 
<li n=?>rience shows is peculiar to the desultory mode of service now in use, and which has produced more 
<li n=?>naval disasters in the world than probably any other one cause. In a word, the principal ends of a 
<li n=?>siavy can no more be obtained, by the services of single ships, than wars can be decided by armies 
<li n=?>cut up into battalions."

<li n=?>dorcet, and De Stael — yet, strange to say, none of these names occur in the Lecture with the excep- 
<li n=?>tion perhaps, of that of Priestly, in an incidental manner! There can be no doubt, however, at what

<li n=?>reason sanctions it ; while, at the same time, it teaches that it shall be given to man to compass its 
<li n=?>attainment ; for reason embodies certain invariable principles which, when once asserted and grasped 
<li n=?>by the people, ai'e used by them as a resting point for farther and extended operations. In regard to 
<li n=?>the principles themselves, their progress will no longer consist in variation, innovation, or change j 
<li n=?>but their immutability shall be the basis of all improvement, which, out of this condition, would be 
<li n=?>liable to the same oscillations and doubts, m the midst of which man has hitherto all but fruitlessly 
<li n=?>consumed his powers and his strength. Now, those principles will obtain so soon as natural law —

<p>
<li n=?>That such a society may bs realized in a given time we are bound to believe with as much cer-

<li n=?>scorn ! They, bound in the darkness of their caves and the filth of their clay hovels, could not realize 
<li n=?>the splendors of the palace and the comforts of its life. They too — had the supercilious word, in- 
<li n=?>ventd by their imitators, been known — they, too, would have exclaimed, Utopia! They, whose 
<li n=?>inch-deep intellect, or whose all-controlling prejudices, stop at the surface of things, and, viewing the 
<li n=?>evils only which still afflict society, pronoimce the notiotr of perfectibility to be chimerical and vain, 
<li n=?>they do not intelligently attend to the sober teachings of reason and truth. Marr, as a sensual being, 
<li n=?>belongs to the world of the senses ; and that is an habitual state of war between his physical powers'— 
<li n=?>a bellum omnium contra omnes — a war of all against all. But, again, man, as a rational being, also 
<li n=?>belongs to the world of mind ; and, as such, he is destined, by the law of his spiritual nature, to subf 
<li n=?>due the material world. The complement of that law will be to defeat the belligerance of material 
<li n=?>forces; and, at some providential period, to assert the full and definite triumph of reason, and the 
<li n=?>consequent prevalence of happiness and peace. Individuals now enjoy that triumph of reason and 
<li n=?>blessing of peace. Why should they not extend to the collective being called society 1 To argue 
<li n=?>that it cannot, is to argue that there is no essential law that will equally apply to man in. his indi- 
<li n=?>vidual and social capacity : it is to advance an unnatural, an anti-social, and a degrading paradox : 
<li n=?>it is to strike at the vitality of virtue, through the freedom of man's will, and madly to insult the 
<li n=?>superhuman wisdom of Him who made man the proxy of his power!"

<li n=?>The " Letters on Paraguay" were exceedingly well received by the reading puDlic, and this is a

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Dr. Francia is, beyond doubt, one of the most remarkable characters of the age, and a man whose 
<li n=?>entire nature has been misunderstood. An array of startling facts here given, will go far to prove

<li n=?>Isabel; or Sicily. A Pilgrimage, By Henry T, Tuckerman. Lea and Blanchard, Phila- 
<li n=?>delphia. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Mr. Tuckerman is known as the author of the "Italian Sketch Book," and of many very readable 
<li n=?>articles in the magazines and annuals. Without much of profundity, of originality, or vigor, he is 
<li n=?>more than usually pure in style, and orthodox in sentiment. The present work will, we think, greatly 
<li n=?>enhance his reputation as a graceful and agreeable writer. The general plan has apparently been 
<li n=?>suggested by that of Bulwer's Pilgrims of the Rhine — although here the similarity ceases. 
<li n=?>Frederick Otley, an American gentleman, travels in Europe with the view of alleviating his grief 
<li n=?>for the loss of a beloved wife, leaving in his southern home a daughter, in charge of her uncle, his 
<li n=?>brother. The absence of the traveller is long continued, and the daughter, having grown to wo- 
<li n=?>manhood, forms the design of surprising him by a visit in Sicily, of which countiy Otley, in his last 
<li n=?>letter, expressed an intention of making the tour. The uncle accompanies her on the voyage, and the 
<li n=?>volume concludes with the re-union of the family. The main, indeed the whole design, is to pre- 
<li n=?>sent the reader with a picturesque account of Sicily, and with the author's own reflections during a 
<li n=?>tour in that comparatively little travelled portion of the old world. The chain of fiction above men- 
<li n=?>tioned, (which appears to us somewhat supererogatory) is given, says Mr. T., for the purpose of 
<li n=?>avoiding that egotistical tone from which it is dithcult to escape in a formal journal, as well as to 
<li n=?>obviate the necessity of dwelling upon those unimportant details and circumstances which aie com- 
<li n=?>mon to every tour m Europe, and therefore too familiar to be interesting. There is an air of quiet 
<li n=?>enthusiasm pervading the whole of tliis little book, which, insensibly, has its influence upon the 
<li n=?>mind of the reader — disposing him to think well of Mr. Tuckerman as a man, not less than to be 
<li n=?>pleased with him as an author. There is much in his character, as we gather it from " Isabel," of 
<li n=?>the warmest poetical impulse — of a perfectly unaffected romance.

</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In general we dislike such title-pages as this. There is a misty atmosphere of humbug all about 
<li n=?>them, through which we peer with a suspicious eye. Time was when the duties of an editor were 
<li n=?>matter of perfect simplicity — at least so far as concerned the public comprehension of these duties; 
<li n=?>but " we have changed all that" as the world grows older, and in every such announcement as we 
<li n=?>find here, there always <li n=?>es perdu a very pretty little enigma. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In its solution there are several points to be considered. Sometimes, as in the case of those su- 
<li n=?>perb passionate tales the "Recollections of a Chaperon," the work will be written, as well as edited, 
<li n=?>by a Lady Dacre. Here there is an affectation of modesty — yet the affectation is not altogether un- 
<li n=?>graceful. Of all the modern editorship this is, beyond doubt, the species least objectionable. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The editorship protective is cf a different class. Here, as in the case of Mr. Willis, (whose fine 
<li n=?>taste should have taught him more intelligible things,) the author makes a somewhat droll bow to a 
<li n=?>foreign audience, holding fast (God only knows why) to the arm of a Barry Cornwall. However, 
<li n=?>there is no harm in the world done, and the worst that can happen is a good hearty laugh on the 
<li n=?>part of the public. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>But there is a third order of this editorial humbuggery which is positively no joke, and which 
<li n=?>should never be regarded as such by any decent individual. An example is found in the case of the 
<li n=?>London publisher, Bentley, who had the downright impudence to get up, some time ago, a reprint 
<li n=?>of our own admirable " Nick of the Woods," and announce it (no doubt to the great edification of 
<li n=?>Dr. Bird,) as under the editorial supervision of Mr. Benjamin D'Israeli. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>In the present instance Mr. James evinces, we think, a sort of half consciousness of being engaged 
<li n=?>in a rather silly affair. The whole preface has the countenance oiun mouton qui reve. " To day," 
<li n=?>he says, with the air of an injured man, " it is necessary for an editor to state what he really has 
<li n=?>done for the work he edits, lest any false impression should be adopted by the pubhc." Having 
<li n=?>premised thus much, he goes on to show very clearly that in the case now in question he has done — 
<li n=?>piecisely nothing at all. We could not wish a better commentary upon the whole editorial system.

<li n=?>Advice to a Young Gentleman on entering Society. By the Author of the " Laws of Etiquette" 
<li n=?>Lea and Blanchard. Philadelphia. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Taking up tliis volume with a strong feeling of prejudice, induced by a certain ad captandum 
<li n=?>air in the title, our attention was ri incited by the very initial sentences, and before getting through 
<li n=?>with the second page we acknowledged the hand of a master. The book is replete with a wordly 
<li n=?>wisdom even profound ; it is the product of a vigorous and cultivated mind, imbued with a thorough 
<li n=?>knowledge of its subject, and discussing it con amore. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The leading truths here inculcated, are, we think, the more important, because, being through 
<li n=?>their very nature confined to superficialities, or apparently so confined, the world at large is easily 
<li n=?>disposed to fall in with those frequent opinions of the grave and learned which declare them inessen- 
<li n=?>tial. But in this case we challenge the judgment of the tribunal, and will not abide by any decision 
<li n=?>which shall be " grave and learned." Pour savoir ce qu'il est (^DieuJ ilfaut etre Dieu meme, says 
<li n=?>the Baron de Bielfeld, in speaking of a more august subject ; but the spirit of his remark is abund- 
<li n=?>antly applicable to the present matter in hand. To form any just estimate of the importance of 
<li n=?>habitual intercourse with our fellows, and, more especially, of an attentive regard to the modelling 
<li n=?>and polishing of our social habits, we must already be men of the world — we must have felt all the 
<li n=?>miseries of a niauvaise honte, and have revelled in all the luxury of a disenthralment from its bonds. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Upon the evils of an absolutely unsocial eKistence it is folly to comment. He who has, at any 
<li n=?>period, entered with heart into the proper spirit of a high society, will find even a temporary with- 
<li n=?>drawal from its usages (urged, let us say, by necessity, or induced by disgust, or sought for the se- 
<li n=?>verer purposes of study) followed by very serious inconveniences, often by poignant mortifications, 
<li n=?>always by a thorough conviction of man's unfitness for such existence, and of its enervating and de- 
<li n=?>basing influence upon his intellectual powers, if not upon the whole organization of his moral being. 
<li n=?>Collecting and concentrating in his retirement an imaginary strength, the solitary student makes at 
<li n=?>length, for some long designed effort, a step into the world of busy life — but this step is feebly and 
<li n=?>irresolutely advanced. A farther progress fully awakens him to his weakness and his folly. The 
<li n=?>volition is in abeyance, which should vivify his forces, and impart to them decision. He now feels 
<li n=?>and perhaps acknovvledges his error. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>We could name no book whatever, in which are better exemplified the truth of opinions such as 
<li n=?>these than in the unpretending volume now before us. In almost every respect it is a valuable and 
<li n=?>exceedingly well written treatise. Among the detailed precepts which form its body there is, per- 
<li n=?>haps, little to be found which the letters of Lord Chesterfield have not already given. But without 
<li n=?>the oflTensive heartlessness of those very objectionable writings, this American work equals them, at 
<li n=?>least, in all their reputable poists — in vigor of thought and diction, in acumen, in practicability, and 
<li n=?>in eyideiaces of wordly knowledge.

<li n=?>A Synopsis of Natural History ,- embracing the Natural History of Animals, with Human and

<li n=?>the latest French Edition of C. Lemmonnier, Professor of Natural History in the Boyal Col- 
<li n=?>lege of Charlemagne ,- luith Additions from the Works of Cuvier, Dumaril, Lacepede, etc. Ar- 
<li n=?>ranged as a Text Book for Schools. By Thomas Wyatt, A. M., Author of Elements of Botany, 
<li n=?>a Manual of Conchohgy, etc. Thomas Wardle, Philadelphia. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>Mr. Wyatt is favorably known to the public as the author of an exceedingly well arranged, ac- 
<li n=?>curate, and beautifully illustrated " Conchohgy," and has been mainly instrumental, we believe, in 
<li n=?>drawing that public attention to the science in this country which is now so obviously manifested. 
<li n=?>We hope that his success with the present publication will be commensurate with the wider range 
<li n=?>which he has taken. It cannot be denied that a synopsis such as he now puts forth has been long 
<li n=?>a desideratum. While there has been no deficiency of school books in any one of the sciences em- 
<li n=?>braced within a proper course of Natural History, it must still have occurred to many as singular, 
<li n=?>that in a study whose very existence may be said to depend upon method, there should have been, 
<li n=?>hitherto, no attempt at collecting the parts into an easily discernible whole. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>As the work of Mr. Wyatt professes to be simply a translation of the well known Tableaux of 
<li n=?>M. Lemmonnier, we need say little more in the way of recommendation than that all the useful 
<li n=?>spirit of the original has been preserved — and this we say from personal knowledge, and the closest

<li n=?>Sketches of Public Characters, Discourses, and Essays, To which is added a Dissertation on the 
<li n=?>Eloquence of the Ancietits. By Henry Lm-d Brougha7n. Philadelphia, E. L. Carey and A. 
<li n=?>Hart. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>This is an exceedingly interesting work, and should be in the hands of every one who reads at 
<li n=?>all. The first volume is made up of the mtroductions to the different speeches of Lord Brougham, 
<li n=?>which were intended to elucidate the history of certain measures discussed, and, incidentally, of the 
<li n=?>periods to which they related. The aim is, to give a pictui'e of the times, in an account of the per- 
<li n=?>sons who bore the chief part in their transactions, in the supposition that the course of state affairs^ 
<li n=?>their posture at any given period, and the nature of the different measures propounded from time to 
<li n=?>time, can only be well understood by giving an accurate representation of the characters of those 
<li n=?>who figured most remarkably upon the stage. This portion of the book embraces a world of detail 
<li n=?>concerning Cobbett, Stephen, Perceval, Roscoe, Lord Castlereagh, Homer, Wilberforce, Bentham, 
<li n=?>Sir James Mackintosh, Canning, Huskisson, Grattan, and others. 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>The second volume is occupied with Lord Brougham's inaugural discourse on being installed 
<li n=?>Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow ; practical obsei-vations upon the education of the people ; 
<li n=?>and a dissertation on the eloquence of the Ancients ; with an appendix of translations from De- 
<li n=?>mosthenes. In the matters here contained. Lord Brougham fully sustains his reputation for sound 
<li n=?>scholarship, as well as profound and luminous criticism. The whole work is imbued with the racy 
<li n=?>spirit of the author's own intellect — an intellect essentially Demosthenic in the almost rude strength, 
<li n=?>directness, and impetuosity of its operations. We cannot too pointedly press this excellent publi- 
<li n=?>cation upon the attention of our readers. The following passage is from a paper on marriage, di-

<li n=?>anecdotes with which he enlivened it, without for an instant fatiguing his audience, would be diffi- 
<li n=?>cult — ^because it is of the nature of the refined essence in which the spirit of the best society con- 
<li n=?>sists, not to keep. When some sudden, and somewhat violent changes of opinion were imputed to

<p>
<li n=?>a learned judge, who was always jocosely termed Mrs , " Varium et mutabile semper fcemina" 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>was Sir William Scott's remark. A celebrated physician having said, somewhat more flippantly 
<li n=?>than beseemed the gravity of his cloth, " Oh, you know. Sir William, after forty a man is always 
<li n=?>either a fool or a physician!" " May'nt he be both. Doctor 1" was the arch rejoinder, with a most 
<li n=?>aich leer, and insinuating voice, half drawled out. " A vicar was once," (said his lordship,* presi- 
<li n=?>ding at the dirmer of the Admiralty sessions) " so wearied out with his parish clerk confining himself 
<li n=?>entirely to the 100th psalm, that he remonstrated, and insisted upon a variety, which the man pro- 
<li n=?>mised ; but old habit proving too strong for him, the old words were as usual given out next Sun- 
<li n=?>day, ' All people that on earth do dwell.' Upon this the vicar's temper could hold out no longer, 
<li n=?>and, jutting his head over the desk, he cried, ' Damn all people that on earth do dwell !' — a very 
<li n=?>compendious form of anathema," added the learned chief of the spiritual court." 
</p>
<p>
<li n=?>* Sir W. Scott was, durmg the latter years of his life, created a peer, by the title of Lord Stow- 
<li n=?>ell ; but it is by his former name that he is known to the profession, and to the world.
