   <lb n=35/>Of Shalispeare'' s Comedy of Love's Lahor's Lost before Qmai Elizabeth. 
</p>
<lb n=36/>
<lb n=37/>
<lb n=38/>
<p>
   <lb n=39/>The subject of the accompanying plate is a fancy sketch by a celebrated English artist, named 
   <lb n=40/>Buss, representing the performance of Shakspeare's comedy of Love's Labor's Lost, before queen 
   <lb n=41/>Elizabeth and her Court. We believe, from the London papers, that the painter intended to repre- 
   <lb n=42/>sent Shakspeare upon the stage before his august patron, in the performance of Don Adriano de Ar- 
   <lb n=43/>mado, a fantastical Spaniard, a character in the above comedy. But we have no authority that the 
   <lb n=44/>dramatist ever performed in the play in question, although we do not possess the power of contra- 
   <lb n=45/>dicting the assertion. The nation and nature of the character, and the quaint allusion contained in 
   <lb n=46/>its name, were undoubtedly designed as a grateful compliment to her virgin majesty. Shakspeare 
   <lb n=47/>was indubitably a courtier, and spared no means of gratifying the weaknesses of Elizabeth and the 
   <lb n=48/>prejudices of the day. The vilifying twisting of the character of Richard IIL, the mortal enemy of 
   <lb n=49/>the giandfather of the queen, is a convincing evidence in support of our assertion. 
</p>
<lb n=50/>
<p>
   <lb n=51/>The play of Love's Labor's Lost (so named in the folio of 1623,) is generally supposed to be the 
   <lb n=52/>earliest of Shakspeare's productions. Malone assigns 1591 as the date of the original drama, but 
   <lb n=53/>changed it afterwards, with sufficient reason, to 1594. Chalmers supposes 1592 as the year wherein 
   <lb n=54/>this comedy was written, but gives no satisfactory cause for his preference. The original edition of 
   <lb n=55/>this play is doubtless lost, for the oldest copy extant, dated 1598, is said, in the title page, to be 
   <lb n=56/>" newly corrected and augmented." In 1597, it was represented at Wliitehall palace, before queen 
   <lb n=57/>Elizabeth, by her express desire — we are then to suppose that we possess the copy of the piece as it 
   <lb n=58/>■was " newly corrected and augmented" for the purpose of exhibition before her majesty. 
</p>
<lb n=59/>
<p>
   <lb n=60/>We have said that there is no autho.ity extant for the assu nption that Shakspeare personated 
   <lb n=61/>Armado, even at the command of her majesty the quean. At the same time, if he played in ^®

   <lb n=73/>piece, he was likely to select tlie character of the thrasonical Spaniard, inasmuch as the broad hu- 
   <lb n=74/>mors of the other masquers rendered them unavailable to an actor of our poet's calibre, and the parts 
   <lb n=75/>of the dashing and witty courtiers were above his pitch. 
</p>
<lb n=76/>
<p>
   <lb n=77/>In Ben Jonson's Every Man in his Humor, his name appears attached to Old Knowell; Adam, 
   <lb n=78/>in his own As You Like It, was another of his assumptions. In Seganus, his name appears 
   <lb n=79/>amongst the comedians — although we know that his ghost in Hamlet was one of his best perform- 
   <lb n=80/>ances, and that he occasionally figured in vaiious of his kingly characters, such as the Fourth, Sixth, 
   <lb n=81/>and Eighth Henrys in his own historical plays. 
</p>
<lb n=82/>
<p>
   <lb n=83/>The last mention of Shakspeare's name as an actor appears in the list of characters attached to 
   <lb n=84/>Ben Jonson's play of Seganus, published in 1603. 
</p>
<lb n=85/>
<p>
   <lb n=86/>Queen Elizabeth frequently indulged in witnessing dramatic performances, produced at her own 
   <lb n=87/>expense, within her own palace walls. The Cotton MSS. contain various charges made in the ac- 
   <lb n=88/>counts of the Master of the Revels for velvets, silks, cloths of gold, etc., for setting forth the stage 
   <lb n=89/>In the very first year of her reign, there is a notice of the players being stopped in their perform- 
   <lb n=90/>ances in consequence of the objectionable matter which they represented. " The same day at nyghS 
   <lb n=91/>(Christmas) at the quens court, ther was a play afor her grace, the whych the plaers plad shuche 
   <lb n=92/>matter that they wher commandyd to leyff off, and continently the maske cam in dansyng." Ne- 
   <lb n=93/>vertheless, we find on the same authority, that on the twelfth night following, " a skaffold" for the 
   <lb n=94/>play was set up in the hall, and " after play was done ther was a goodly maske, and after, a giett 
   <lb n=95/>bankett that last tyll midnyght," 
</p>
<lb n=96/>
<p>
   <lb n=97/>The " skaflTold in the hall" sounds rudely to a modern ear, as the chief appliance and means of 
   <lb n=98/>dramatic display in the palatial abode of the queen of England. But the public stage was in its in- 
   <lb n=99/>fancy at the time of Shakspeare's birth, and the conveniences and elegant fittings wherewith the 
   <lb n=100/>drama of the present day is graced, were unknown to the most ardent well-wisher of the stage in 
   <lb n=101/>the early days of Elizabeth's reign. Chalmers observes " that what Augustus said of Rome may be 
   <lb n=102/>remarked of Elizabeth and the stage ; he found it brick and he left it marble." At her accession in 
   <lb n=103/>1558, no regular theatre had been established, and the players of that period, even in the capital, 
   <lb n=104/>were compelled to have recourse to the yards of great inns, as the most commodious places which 
   <lb n=105/>they could obtain for the representation of their pieces. These being surrounded by open stages and 
   <lb n=106/>galleries, and possessing hkewise numerous private apartments and recesses, from which the gen- 
   <lb n=107/>teeler part of the audience might become spectators at their ease, while the central space held a tem~ 
   <lb n=108/>porary stage, uncovered m fine weather, and protected by an awning in bad, were not ill calculated 
   <lb n=109/>for the purposes of scenic exhibition, and most undoubtedly gave rise to the form and construction 
   <lb n=110/>adopted in the erection of the licensed theatres. 
</p>
<lb n=111/>
<p>
   <lb n=112/>In consequence of Elizabeth's patronage, the drama rapidly assumed an important stand. A re- 
   <lb n=113/>gular play-house was built in the Blackfriars in 1570, and in 1574, Burbage's regular company of 
   <lb n=114/>players was established by royal license. Before the sixteenth century expired, fouiteen distinct 
   <lb n=115/>companies of players exhilirated the golden days of good queen Bess, Shakspeare's name appearing 
   <lb n=116/>on the list enrolled by lord Warwick and the lord Chamberlain. Theatres, of course, proportionately 
   <lb n=117/>increased ; and during the time that Shakspeare immortalized the stage, not less than seven of these 
   <lb n=118/>structures, of established popularity, were in existence, with various others of ephemeral notoriety.

<lb n=178/><head>INTRODUCTION. 
</head>
<lb n=179/>
<p>
   <lb n=180/>The frigate Constitution has a deathless fame. There is a charm in her simple name that arrests 
   <lb n=181/>the eye, and rivets the attention of the cursory readei. Old Ironsides! Why the hare mention of 
   <lb n=182/>this sobriquet carries us back to the days of Nicholson and Talbot, to the actions with the Guerriere, 
   <lb n=183/>the Java, and the Cyane and the Levant; and we fancy that we hear the roar of her cannon, the 
   <lb n=184/>blast of her bugle, her cry of enthusiasm as she went into battle, and her loud huzza as she came 
   <lb n=185/>out victoriously ; — before us, a Hull, a Bainbridge, and a Stewart appear, together with a host of 
   <lb n=186/>other choice spirits, both officers and men, who trod her blood-stained decks, and shared her impe- 
   <lb n=187/>rishable glory. Her picture is in almost every dwelling ; she marks the covers of toy books and 
   <lb n=188/>paper reams, and hangs over the door of the seaman's rendezvous. The backwoodsman, in his log 
   <lb n=189/>cabin amid the western forest, has counted her guns, and puzzled over her ropes. Every nation un- 
   <lb n=190/>der heaven has seen her; and her deeds have been the talk of the civilized world. Tiuly, she is 
   <lb n=191/>the lucky ship of our navy ! the pride of every patriot, and the boast of every American citizen ; 
   <lb n=192/>and, sooner than surrender her to an enemy, every son of this vast republic should feel willing to 
   <lb n=193/>go down with her to the blue depths of ocean with her drums beating and colors flying, and hear 
   <lb n=194/>with pleasure the thunder of the scowling wave as it closes over her " pennon, spar, and sail." 
</p>
<lb n=195/>
<p>
   <lb n=196/>It is usual when men of mighty genius, of gallant bearing, of holy zeal, and of noble ancestry, ap- 
   <lb n=197/>pear on this mundane sphere, for some contemporary to give a minute account of their lives and ac- 
   <lb n=198/>tions ; and so far is the custom carried at the present day, that the curtain of domestic life is clewed up, 
   <lb n=199/>and we are shown the mysteries behind the scenes. Will it be considered strange, then, if one shall 
   <lb n=200/>■write a series of sketches of the deeds of the gallant Constitution 1 Surely, if each Httle great man 
   <lb n=201/>has his Boswell, Old Ironsides shall have her trumpeter ! 
</p>
<lb n=202/>
<p>
   <lb n=203/>In the following pages, fact will be blended with fancy in such a manner as not to murder truth, 
   <lb n=204/>and the author will endeavor to twine for himself a wreath from the inexhaustible laurel that now 
   <lb n=205/>blooms from the stump of her keel, and hangs around her frame. Startling incidents from each 
   <lb n=206/>cruize will be taken from authentic sources, and what has been omitted by the pen of history, will 
   <lb n=207/>be added hy that of memory. In many instances, the details of others will be copied, taking care 
   <lb n=208/>never to do so, without making proper acknowledgment in the notes at the bottom of the page. 
   <lb n=209/>Having trod the deck of this noble frigate, and heard the piping of the gale through her rigging, and 
   <lb n=210/>the thunder of her cannon above the shifting valleys of ocean, the author feels confident that he shali 
   <lb n=211/>he able to serve up the dear old ship like a skilful cook, in a hundred different ways, and unfold 
   <lb n=212/>many a deed of high and noble daring.

<lb n=215/>
<lb n=216/><head>EARLY HISTORY. 
</head>
<lb n=217/>
<p>
   <lb n=218/>Tlie frigate Constitution was laid down at Boston, Mass., under an act of Congress, approved 
   <lb n=219/>March 27lh, 1794. She was modelled by Joshua Humphreys, Esq., of Philndelphia, — the father of 
   <lb n=220/>the present talented Chief Naval Constructor, — who likewise modelled the frigates President, Uni- 
   <lb n=221/>ted States, Chesapeake, Constellation, and Congress. She was rated a forty-four gun ship, but like 
   <lb n=222/>all other rated ships, both English and American, she carried more guns than were named. She 
   <lb n=223/>had thirty port-holes on the gun deck, and twenty-four on the spar deck, and her number of service* 
   <lb n=224/>able cannon was fifty-four. She carries that number now.

</p>
<lb n=229/>
<p>
   <lb n=230/>On the 30th of September, 1797, she ghded into her natural element amid the shouts of thousands 
   <lb n=231/>of spectators, who had collected to witness the novel sight, and had she not stuck on the ways at an 
   <lb n=232/>earlier period, she would have been the first vessel launched under the new organization of the navy. 
   <lb n=233/>As it was, she was baptized with blood — a ship carpenter, by the name of Champney, having been 
   <lb n=234/>killed by the falling of one of her shoars. 
</p>
<lb n=235/>
<p>
   <lb n=236/>On the 20th July, 1798, she got underway for the first time, under the command of Captain Sa- 
   <lb n=237/>muel Nicholson, a gallant officer ; and in August cruized with four revenue cutters along the coast 
   <lb n=238/>of the United States, to the southward of Cape Heniy. At the close of the year '98, while under 
   <lb n=239/>the command of Captain Nicholson, she was attached to the West India squadron, commanded by 
   <lb n=240/>Commodore Barry. In 1799, she became the flag ship of Commodore Talbot, on the St, Domingo 
   <lb n=241/>station, and here she commenced her gallant career. 
</p>
<lb n=242/>
<p>
   <lb n=243/>Having thus brought the old ship down to the commencement of the present century, we leave 
   <lb n=244/>the reader to learn her farther history from the following sketches and anecdotes. 
</p>

</head>
<lb n=249/>
<p>
   <lb n=250/>Of all services of danger which a naval officer has to perform during a time of war, and there are 
   <lb n=251/>^uany, the task of cutting out an armed vessel from under the guns of an enemy's foit, and bringing 
   <lb n=252/>-her out of the harbor in safety, is considered the most desperate. Coolness and courage must travel 
   <lb n=253/>hand in hand there; and the successful commander of such an expedition, under the most favorable 
   <lb n=254/>circumstances, must consider himself well off if he earns his laurels at the cost of blood. 
</p>
<lb n=255/>
<p>
   <lb n=256/>The sun was slowly descending behind the blue peaks of San Domingo, when an American -fri- 
   <lb n=257/>gate came in sight of the village of Port Platte, situated at the head of a small liaibor on tire south 
   <lb n=258/>■side of the island, and, furling her courses, hove to, for tlie pui-pose of reconnoitering. After scan- 
   <lb n=259/>iiing narrowly the little anchorage, the frigate put about, and, setting her courses, was soon lost amid 
   <lb n=260/>the shades of night. The inhabitants of the village had felt great alarm at the near approach of the 
   <lb n=261/>armed ship, and had reinforced their fort, beside sending a number of soldiers on board of the letter 
   <lb n=262/>of marque, Sandwich, formerly a British packet, but now in the service of the French, which lay 
   <lb n=263/>close under the guns of the fort, wheie she was receiving a cargo of coffee, previous to her making 
   <lb n=264/>a run for France. 
</p>
<lb n=265/>
<p>
   <lb n=266/>It was in the year 1800, just after the action between the Constellation and La Vengeance, and 
   <lb n=267/>Uic name of the conqueror, Truxton, passed from lip to lip with instinctive consternation. Night 
   <lb n=268/>came on; the moon had not appeared, and scudding clouds obscured the stars. The reveilM had 
   <lb n=269/>been beaten at the garrison, and the inhabitants of Port Platte had retired to dream of the daring 
   <lb n=270/>cruizers of the American squadron. The frigate, when she had lost sight of the island, came about, 
   <lb n=271/>and under easy sail stood in for the shore. She was the Constitution, Commodore Talbot, and from 
   <lb n=272/>the silence that reigned throughout the ship, and the total absence of light from the battle lanterns, 
   <lb n=273/>the most careless observer would have supposed that she was about to do sometliing for the glory of 
   <lb n=274/>the old thirteen. 
</p>
<lb n=275/>
<p>
   <lb n=276/>As she drew nigh the port, two officers might have been seen at the gangway, watching narrowly 
   <lb n=277/>the lights that twinkled ahead. At this moment, the heavy roar of a cannon came echoing along 
   <lb n=278/>the waters, and then one after another, the lights disappeared, until none were seen but those which 
   <lb n=279/>seemed to be designed to burn throughout the night. 
</p>
<lb n=280/>
<p>
   <lb n=281/>" Now is your time," said the elder of the persons to the younger ; "have the second cutter man- 
   <lb n=282/>ned, sir, and come to me for farther orders." Thus saying, the commodore, for it was he, looked at the 
   <lb n=283/>compass and entered the cabin. In a few minutes, a knock at the cabin door, announced the arrival 
   <lb n=284/>of some officer to make a report. 
</p>
<lb n=285/>
<p>
   <lb n=286/>" Enter," said the bluff old commodore, and immediately lieutenant Hull, the first of the Consti- 
   <lb n=287/>tution, stood before him. 
</p>
<lb n=288/>
<p>
   <lb n=289/>" Are you ready 1'' said the commodore. 
   <lb n=290/>" All ready, sir," replied the lieutenant. 
</p>
<lb n=291/>
<p>
   <lb n=292/>" Then, sir," said the commodore, " you will enter the harbor of Port Platte without being dia- 
   <lb n=293/>covered, ascertain whether the ciaft that lies under the guns of the fort is the Sandwich, and when 
   <lb n=294/>you shall have done so, return and make a report to me." 
</p>
<lb n=295/>
<p>
   <lb n=296/>" How shall I ascertain that fact without boarding her 1" said the lieutenant. 
   <lb n=297/>" You will know her to be the Sandwich," replied the commodore, " by the black stripes around 
   <lb n=298/>her white masts, and by the shortness of her bowsprit. Make haste, sir, for I long to give you a 
   <lb n=299/>job." 
</p>
<lb n=300/>
<p>
   <lb n=301/>The lieutenant smiled as he bade the commodore good night, and, immediately ascending, gave 
   <lb n=302/>such orders to the officer of the deck as he deemed necessary under the citcumstances of the case. 
   <lb n=303/>The night was pretty well advanced as Mr. Hull wrapped himself in his boat cloak, and seated him- 
   <lb n=304/>self in the stern sheets of the second cutter. 
</p>
<lb n=305/>
<p>
   <lb n=306/>" Shove off— let fall — pull cheerily, my boys," were the orders he gave, in a low voice, in quick

<p>
   <lb n=312/>SQCCession ; then passing swiftly around the frigate's stern, he pulled for the harbor, and was soon 
   <lb n=313/>lost sight of. 
</p>
<lb n=314/>
<p>
   <lb n=315/>For two hours, nothing was heard of the adventurous ofircer or his boat, and the old commodore 
   <lb n=316/>began to grow quite anxious about them. Already a pale streak stretched itself along the eastern 
   <lb n=317/>waters, and the clouds giew thinner and fewer, while here and there a star peeped out, and was re- 
   <lb n=318/>flected back by the waves below. 
</p>
<lb n=319/>
<p>
   <lb n=320/>" Boat ahoy '." challenged the sentinel at the gangway of the Constitution, as the dash of oars at 
   <lb n=321/>this moment fell upon his ear. 
</p>
<lb n=322/>
<p>
   <lb n=323/>"Aye! aye !" replied the officer of the boat, and soon lieutenant Hull crossed the gangway of the 
   <lb n=324/>^ip. 
</p>
<lb n=325/>
<p>
   <lb n=326/>" It is the Sandwich, sir," said the lieutenant, after reporting his return, and paying the custom- 
   <lb n=327/>ary salute. 
</p>
<lb n=328/>
<p>
   <lb n=329/>" Are you certain!" said commodore Talbot.

<p>
   <lb n=331/>" I am, sir," replied the officer, " for I lay directly under hex stern, and heard through the cabin 
   <lb n=332/>•windows, which were open, her officers congratulating themselves upon the departure of the Con- 
   <lb n=333/>stellation, for such they deem this ship to be. Beside, I noticed her masts and bowsprit, as I swept 
   <lb n=334/>along under the guns of the fort — they are as you described them to be." 
</p>
<lb n=335/>
<p>
   <lb n=336/>" I'll have her, by ," said commodore Talbot, as he looked again at the harbor, which began 
</p>
<lb n=337/>
<p>
   <lb n=338/>to show itself amid the haze of dawn. " About ship, sir — set all the studding sails," and, bidding 
   <lb n=339/>the heutenant good night, the commander in chief bounced into his cabin. 
</p>
<lb n=340/>
<p>
   <lb n=341/>The frigate swiftly came about, and took her departure from the land. Soon the studding sails 
   <lb n=342/>on both sides were spread out to the wind, and, like a mountain of snow, she danced along upon 
   <lb n=343/>the bosom of the deep until her morning watch looked out in vain for the blue outline of the island 
   <lb n=344/>of San Domingo. 
</p>
<lb n=345/>
<p>
   <lb n=346/>" Sail O !" cried the look-out. 
</p>
<lb n=347/>
<p>
   <lb n=348/>" Where away ?" said the officer of the deck. 
</p>
<lb n=349/>
<p>
   <lb n=350/>" On the lee bow, sir," replied the seaman. 
</p>
<lb n=351/>
<p>
   <lb n=352/>" Can you make her out 1" hailed the officer. 
</p>
<lb n=353/>
<p>
   <lb n=354/>«' She is a sloop, sir, and shows American colors." 
</p>
<lb n=355/>
<p>
   <lb n=356/>" Hoist our ensign," said the lieutenant. 
</p>
<lb n=357/>
<p>
   <lb n=358/>" Aye, there comes the Sally in the nick of time." said the commodore, who had left the cabin at 
   <lb n=359/>the first hail. " Mr. Hull, make a signal for hei to run down and speak us ; we will soon proceed 
   <lb n=360/>to business." 
</p>
<lb n=361/>
<p>
   <lb n=362/>In a short time, the sail, which proved to be the American sloop Sally, came alongside of the Con- 
   <lb n=363/>stitution. After a conference with her captain, he and his crew came on board the frigate, while 
   <lb n=364/>lieutenant Hull, with a party of seamen and marines, the latter led by the brave captain Carmick 
   <lb n=365/>immediately repaired on board of the sloop. Having received orders from the commodore, the sloop 
   <lb n=366/>now put her helm up, and ran for the island. 
</p>
<lb n=367/>
<p>
   <lb n=368/>" In the course of the night, while running down for her port under easy sail, a shot suddenly 
   <lb n=369/>flew over the Sally, and soon after an English frigate ranged up alongside. Mr. Hull hove to and 
   <lb n=370/>when the boarding lieutenant gained the sloop's deck, where he found so large a party of men and 
   <lb n=371/>officers in naval unifoims, he was much surprised. He was told the object of the expedition how- 
   <lb n=372/>ever, and expressed his disappointment, as his own ship was only waiting to let the Sandwich com- 
   <lb n=373/>plete her cargo, in order to cut her out also."* 
</p>
<lb n=374/>
<p>
   <lb n=375/>It was about^noon of the following day when the sloop stood in to the harbor of Port Platte. Be- 
   <lb n=376/>fore her lay the Sandwich, with her broadside bearing on the approach ; and in the rear of her at 
   <lb n=377/>no great distance, a battery shov/ed its long row of black teeth for her protection. 
</p>
<lb n=378/>
<p>
   <lb n=379/>Lieutenant Hull had sent nearly all the men below, before he entered the harbor, and now, having 
   <lb n=380/>a stern anchor ready, he bore down, like a short-handed lubberly sloop, for the bows of the Sand- 
   <lb n=381/>wich. As he drew nigh the ship, he said, in a low voice, " Stand by to board," and soon a large 
   <lb n=382/>number of men crouched under the bulwarks, ready for action. 
</p>
<lb n=383/>
<p>
   <lb n=384/>" You will be afoul of me," said the lieutenant of the Sandwich, who was leaning carelessly over 
   <lb n=385/>the bulwark as the sloop came down. 
</p>
<lb n=386/>
<p>
   <lb n=387/>" I think I shall," was the laconic reply. In a moment, the sloop struck the bows of the enemy. 
</p>
<lb n=388/>
<p>
   <lb n=389/>" Let go the kedge '." thundered the lieutenant — it was done like magic. 
</p>
<lb n=390/>
<p>
   <lb n=391/>" Boarders, away !" cried he ; and, seizing his cutlass, he crossed the gangway of the Sandwich 
   <lb n=392/>at the head of his men, and carried her without a struggle. 
</p>
<lb n=393/>
<p>
   <lb n=394/>Captain Carmick, in the ship's boats, now landed, carried the battery, spiked the guns, and retired 
   <lb n=395/>without the loss of a man. 
</p>
<lb n=396/>
<p>
   <lb n=397/>A great commotion was nov/ perceptible on shore ; but the commander and his crew went swiftly 
   <lb n=398/>to work to secure their prize, and, though she was dismantled above her deck, and her guns stowed 
   <lb n=399/>in the hold, before sunset she had her royal yards crossed, her guns scaled, and her crew quartered.

</p>
<lb n=418/>
<p>
   <lb n=419/>" The United States ship Talbot, I. Hull, commander," replied the victorious officer, as he drew 
   <lb n=420/>near enough to be distinguished by the othcers of the frigate. 
</p>
<lb n=421/>
<p>
   <lb n=422/>" It is Hull, by heavens !" said the commodore. In a few minutes lieutenant Hull came on board 
   <lb n=423/>and made his official report. After a short time, the Sally's captain and crew were returned to their 
   <lb n=424/>vessel, with many thanks, and lieutenant Hull, having received orders to that effect, repaired on 
   <lb n=425/>board the prize as her commander, and, crowding on all sail, followed the commodore to Jamaica.

<p>
   <lb n=431/>In 1803, we find our favorite ship, bearing the broad pendant of commodore Preble, entering the 
   <lb n=432/>Mediterranean, to battle with the powers of Barbary. Octol)er 6th, 1803, the frigate Philadelphia, 
   <lb n=433/>captain Bainbridge, captured off Cape de Gatta a cruizer belonging to the emperor of Morocco, call- 
   <lb n=434/>ed the Meshboha, of twenty-two guns, Ibrahim Lubarez, commander, with a crew of one hundred 
   <lb n=435/>aaid twenty men. This vessel having piratically seized the brig Celia, of Boston, commodore Pre- 
   <lb n=436/>Me, in the Constitution, accompanied by the Nautilus, and the return squadron of commodore Kod- 
   <lb n=437/>gers, sailed for Tangier Bay, for the purpose of convincing the brother of the sun and moon that a 
   <lb n=438/>war with the United States would inevitably result in the destruction of his piratical navy, 
</p>
<lb n=439/>
<p>
   <lb n=440/>Tangier is situated on the northern coast of Africa, but a short distance from Cape Spartel. It 
   <lb n=441/>£S a walled city of Morocco, and is rarely if ever visited excepting by market boats and vessels of 
   <lb n=442/>war, on account of the long quarantine which is imposed by ports higher up the Mediterranean, 
   <lb n=443/>upon all vessels who may have touched there. It lies thirty miles west of Gibraltar, is strongly foi- 
   <lb n=444/>tified, has fourteen thousand inhabitants, and is the principal sea-port of the Moors. 
</p>
<lb n=445/>
<p>
   <lb n=446/>Its appearance from the sea is beautiful. Castles and forts of white stone, with the blood red flag 
   <lb n=447/>•floating over each baslioh ; numerous white buildings, with the flags of every commercial nation 
   <lb n=448/>waving in the breeze above them. Groves of orange and cypress trees towering above the walls, 
   <lb n=449/>Hiark the foreground ; while far in the blue distance, the mountains of Mauritania towering in gran- 
   <lb n=450/>deur, and to the left, and nigh at hand, the wild and broken summits of Mount Abyla — or in com- 
   <lb n=451/>3cnon parlance, Apes Hill — rising high above the straits, complete a picture which, for variety and 
   <lb n=452/>beauty, is rarely equalled in the Mediteiranean. If you turn to the opposite shore, you behold, peep- 
   <lb n=453/>ing out from its beautiful olive groves, the little town of Tarifa, in Andalusia, celebrated as the spot 
   <lb n=454/>where the Moors first landed, undei Taric el Tuerto, and commenced the conquest of Spain ; and far- 
   <lb n=455/>ther out from the main land, you see its light-house, pointing the wandering mariner to the passage be- 
   <lb n=456/>tween the pillars of Hercules; and, farther up the straits, behold "Dark Calpe's frowning steep," 
   <lb n=457/>rising like a watchful lion to guard the sunny sea. 
</p>
<lb n=458/>
<p>
   <lb n=459/>In an inexhaustible' stone quaiTy near the city, which has been worked from time immemorial, to 
   <lb n=460/>supply the Moors with mill stones, there stood a pillar, with an inscription upon its base, which in- 
   <lb n=461/>formed the reader that it was raised by the wandering Canaanites, who had been driven out of their 
   <lb n=462/>land, " flowing with milk and honey," by Joshua, the son of Nun ; and from the solid blocks of 
   <lb n=463/>stone that lie about the entrance, and the great extent of the excavation — which reaches out to the 
   <lb n=464/>sea — it requires but a little stretch of the human mind to believe that the children of Anak once 
   <lb n=465/>labored there. 
</p>
<lb n=466/>
<p>
   <lb n=467/>It was sunrise at the straits of Gibraltar, when an American squadron stood by Tarifa point, and 
   <lb n=468/>liove to in the bay of Tangier. The shores were sleeping in misty splendor, as the commodore furl- 
   <lb n=469/>ed his topsails and made a signal for the squadron to anchor. Having secured the ships, a salute of 
   <lb n=470/>twenty-one guns was fired, with the flag of Morocco floating at the fore, which was speedily answer- 
   <lb n=471/>ed by the battery on shore. Freedom and slavery now lay side by side ; the stars and the stripes, 
   <lb n=472/>and the bloody ensigns of the corsairs, waved together in the breeze, while the rattling of the Con- 
   <lb n=473/>sxitution's drums mingled with the clashing of the Mussulman's cymbals. It was a stirring hour — 
   <lb n=474/>the emperor's household had heard the roar of artillery, and wonder sate upon every countenance. 
</p>
<lb n=475/>
<p>
   <lb n=476/>It was yet early in the morning when the most sublime and mighty prince of Mauritania, aroused 
   <lb n=477/>from his quiet sleep in his drowsy harem by the report of the Constitution's cannon, repaired to the 
   <lb n=478/>divan, and held high court. There was a scowl upon his brow as he twisted his magnificent mus- 
   <lb n=479/>tachios, and his thin lip curled in scorn, while his dark eye flashed with unusual brilliancy. Be- 
   <lb n=480/>fore him, were the abject subjects of his will, and myriads of heads bent down in homage as he 
   <lb n=481/>seated himself, while his body guards, in jewelled robes and spotted turbans, with pomp and pride, 
   <lb n=482/>took their stations behind his ottoman. At length, beckoning to the bey, he said — " What dogs are 
</p>
<lb n=483/>

<lb n=486/><head>OLD IRONSIDES. IT

<p>
   <lb n=488/>these which disturb our ro3aI sleep before the hour of morning prayer 1 Hasten, Hassan, and bring 
   <lb n=489/>us information." 
</p>
<lb n=490/>
<p>
   <lb n=491/>The bey informed him that a large squadron of American vessels of war had anchored in the 
   <lb n=492/>harbor. 
</p>
<lb n=493/>
<p>
   <lb n=494/>" Mishalla !" said the emperor, with a look of apprehension, " let them be attended to." 
</p>
<lb n=495/>
<p>
   <lb n=496/>A white flag now streamed from the nearest bastion, which was answered by a similar display 
   <lb n=497/>from every ship in the squadron ; and then a boat shot from the side of the Constitution, with a 
   <lb n=498/>noble-looking oflicer in her stern-sheets, whose uniform showed him to be a captain in the navy of 
   <lb n=499/>the United States. He was commodore Preble. In a short half hour, the emperor gave the gallant 
   <lb n=500/>commodore an audience, and Mr. Simpson, the American consul, was placed upon a footing with, 
   <lb n=501/>the consuls of the most favored nations. The emperor, through his interpreter, expressed his regret 
   <lb n=502/>that any difference had arisen between the two nations, disavowed having given any hostile orders, 
   <lb n=503/>and declared that he would punish any of his governors who had. He then gave an order, under 
   <lb n=504/>his seal, for the release of the American brig Hannah, her cargo and crew, detained at Mogadore ; 
   <lb n=505/>and the commodore gave up the Meshboha, the vessel taken by captain Bainbridge, and the Mis- 
   <lb n=506/>houda, the vessel taken by commodore Rodgers, at an earlier period of the war. Having smoked a 
   <lb n=507/>pipe and drunk the coffee of the most illustrious Moor, the commander of the squadron was about 
   <lb n=508/>to retire from the presence chamber, when the emperor suddenly clapped his hands. Hassan Bey 
   <lb n=509/>stepped forwaid. " Bring me the pen of my father, and the treaty made between him and the new 
   <lb n=510/>world," said he, " that I may sign my name, and afHx my seal to it." 
</p>
<lb n=511/>
<p>
   <lb n=512/>The pen and the parchment scroll were then brought in, and Hassan Bey, having unrolled the 
   <lb n=513/>latter on his bended knees, the emperor, in the presence of his divan, made his mark and affixed his 
   <lb n=514/>seal below the ratification of his father ; and it is just to state, that ever afterwards he observed its 
   <lb n=515/>stipulations with the strictness of an honest Mussulman. Three years ago, this treaty, which was 
   <lb n=516/>to continue fifty years from its date, expired, and a new one was entered into, which is now in force. 
   <lb n=517/>It is not a httle singular that the frigate Constitution, at the request of the consul of Tangier, made 
   <lb n=518/>her second appearance off that port in 1836, to hasten a treaty with the emperor of Morocco. Will 
   <lb n=519/>she, fifty years hence, be ready to do the same thing ? God grant it. 
</p>
<lb n=520/>
<p>
   <lb n=521/>After the usual ceremonies of leave-taking, the divan broke up ; the commodore then repaired on 
   <lb n=522/>board his ship, and fired a salute ; the consul hoisted his flag again over his consulate, and the squad- 
   <lb n=523/>ron getting under way, the Constitution stood up the straits followed by the Nautilus, while com- 
   <lb n=524/>modore Rodgers and the return squadron proceeded to the United Slates. 
</p>
<lb n=525/>
<p>
   <lb n=526/>There is nothing like loaded cannon for expediting the consummation of a 'treaty with the Moors, 
   <lb n=527/>and the only tribute that will satisfy them for ever, must consist of thirty-two pourvJ shot. There 
   <lb n=528/>is no mistaking the meaning of such presents, and when offered by a Preble, from the deck of the 
   <lb n=529/>Constitution, they — as we shall see hereafter — protected the flag, and increased the glory of his na- 
   <lb n=530/>tive land. 
</p>
<lb n=531/>
<p>
   <lb n=532/>At midnight, as the Constitution, under easy sail, was beating up for Gibraltar, " she suddenly 
   <lb n=533/>found herself alongside a large ship. Some hailing passed, without either party giving an answer ; 
   <lb n=534/>commodore Preble, who had taken the trumpet himself, now told the name and country of his ship,, 
   <lb n=535/>and his own rank. He then demanded the name of the stranger, adding that he would fire a shot 
   <lb n=536/>unless answered. 
</p>
<lb n=537/>
<p>
   <lb n=538/>" ' If you fire a shot, I'll return a broadside,' was the reply. 
</p>
<lb n=539/>
<p>
   <lb n=540/>" Preble sprang into his mizen rigging, applied the trumpet, and said — ' This is the United States 
   <lb n=541/>ship Constitution, a forty-four, commodore Edward Preble; I am about to hail you for the last time ; 
   <lb n=542/>if not answered, I shall fire into you. What ship is that V 
</p>
<lb n=543/>
<p>
   <lb n=544/>" ' This is his Britannic Majesty's ship Donnegal, a razee of sixty guns.' 
</p>
<lb n=545/>
<p>
   <lb n=546/>" Preble told the stranger he doubted his statement, and should lie by him until morning, in order 
   <lb n=547/>to ascertain his real character. He was as good as his word, and in a short time, a boat came from 
   <lb n=548/>the other vessel to explain. It was an English /rig-a^e, and the Constitution had got so suddenly 
   <lb n=549/>and unexpectedly alongside of her, that the hesitation about answering, and the fictitious name, had 
   <lb n=550/>proceeded from a desire to gain time, in order to clear the ship and to get to quarters. The spirit of 
   <lb n=551/>commodore Preble on this occasion produced a very favorable impression in his own ship ; the young: 
   <lb n=552/>men pithily remarking, that if he was wrong in his temper, he was right in his heart."* 
</p>
<lb n=553/>
<p>
   <lb n=554/>The next morning, the Constitution came to anchor off Gibraltar, and thus ended the war with-. 
   <lb n=555/>Morocco.

   <lb n=661/>Evert village which has seen its third generation, and every public building -which has survived 
   <lb n=662/>the peltings of a half century's storms, claim as a part of their natural possessions, a larger or smaller 
   <lb n=663/>portion of legendary lore. It is the powerful principle of association which imparts its interest to the 
   <lb n=664/>antique dwelling or dismantled tower ; and as we gaze upon them, the imagination pierces the mist 
   <lb n=665/>of the past and enlivens the scene with beings of its own creation. We go back to years long since 
   <lb n=666/>commingled with the ocean of eternity, and see the busy actors of life's drama, as they performed 
   <lb n=667/>their parts in the particular acts assigned them; and although they have flitted off the stage, the the 
   <lb n=668/>atre of their performance is still before us. It affords us pleasure even when we are thrown solely 
   <lb n=669/>tipon our imagination for persons and incidents to complete the scene : but the effort is less when we 
   <lb n=670/>are supported with the principal events by history or tradition. 
</p>
<lb n=671/>
<p>
   <lb n=672/>No public building, perhaps, of the same age, affords as much food to the lover of incident, as a 
   <lb n=673/>college. Changing its occupants every year ; its inhabitants collected promiscuously from all ranks 
   <lb n=674/>of society, and possessing every possible shade of character and temperament, — its history must ne- 
   <lb n=675/>cessarily be diversified. If the walls of our older institutions had tongues, how many thrilling tales 
   <lb n=676/>of high anticipations, youthful enthusiasm, powerful effort and blasted hopes, might they disclose ! 
   <lb n=677/>I have often listened to the breeze as it sighed through the long halls of our building, and imagined 
   <lb n=678/>that it bore to my ear the merry peals of laughter which have rung through its chambers, mingled 
   <lb n=679/>with the low sighs of many a hardened heart which has told its sorrow to that heedless breeze. 
</p>
<lb n=680/>
<p>
   <lb n=681/>There is one tale of grief connected with our alma mater, which has floated among us as a con- 
   <lb n=682/>stituent part of hei earlier history. About thirty years ago, among the many who were here engaged 
   <lb n=683/>in the enthusiastic strife for literary acquirement, there were two young hearts whose warm currents 
   <lb n=684/>have long since been frozen in death. The rising sun of their hopes was early shrouded in a dark 
</p>
<lb n=685/>
<p>
   <lb n=686/>cloud which cast a melancholy shadow over the history of their lives. T of Kentucky, was a 
</p>
<lb n=687/>
<p>
   <lb n=688/>young man of respectable parts, but bold, passionate, and supercilious. Although his talents might 
   <lb n=689/>have gained him respect, his disposition created an aversion to him among his companions and fellow 
   <lb n=690/>students. He had that haughtiness in his carriage which is always sure to render a member of a 
   <lb n=691/>society, as united as that of a college, disagreeable and unpopular. In the assignment of chambers 
   <lb n=692/>he obtained as his room-mate a young gentleman who differed as much from him in disposition as 
</p>
<lb n=693/>
<p>
   <lb n=694/>the zenith does from the nadir. C was a quiet gentle soul. He possessed those qualities which 
</p>
<lb n=695/>
<p>
   <lb n=696/>secured him the warmest aflections of all around him. Although in delicate health, and generally 
   <lb n=697/>pensive and retiring, the natural kindness and warmth of his feelings which gushed up like a full 
   <lb n=698/>spring, endeared him to every one who formed an intimacy with him. As they differed so much iu 
   <lb n=699/>their disposition, it is not to be expected that their mutual company would be agreeable. For some 
   <lb n=700/>time, however, the restraint which a slight acquaintance imposed, prevented an exhibition of impro- 
   <lb n=701/>priety on the part of the former, or uneasiness in the latter, but as they became more familiar, the 
</p>
<lb n=702/>
<p>
   <lb n=703/>spirit of T showed itself in unkind treatment to his room-mate. The sensitive heart of C 
</p>
<lb n=704/>
<p>
   <lb n=705/>could not brook the continued injury and unjustifiable abuse which was heaped upon him day after 
   <lb n=706/>day. The presence of his insulter rendered his room the most disagreeable place on earth to him, 
   <lb n=707/>and when absent his mind brooded over the incurable wounds which had been inflicted upon him. 
</p>
<lb n=708/>
<p>
   <lb n=709/>We gave T warning that a continuance of his conduct would be visited with retribution; but 
</p>
<lb n=710/>
<p>
   <lb n=711/>still he persisted in the same treatment which he before observed. In an evil hour C sent him a 
</p>
<lb n=712/>
<p>
   <lb n=713/>note, demanding gentlemanly satisfaction. The challenge was accepted, and the necessary preli- 
   <lb n=714/>minaries arranged.

<p>
   <lb n=718/>Day was just dawning, and the pencil of light which streamed across the eastern horizon, pro- 
   <lb n=719/>claimed the rising morning. The stars had not yet ceased to be visible. The citizens of our quiet 
   <lb n=720/>tovsm were yet wrapt in the arms of sleep. To a verdawt lane within sight of the college, two small 
   <lb n=721/>groups of persons were seen to move. ' There was a solemnity in their deportment which indicated

<p>
   <lb n=733/>that the occasion which called them out was not one of a lively nature. They moved with a firm,r. 
   <lb n=734/>decisive step, as though neiving themselves to receive some sudden shock, or witness a painful catas- 
   <lb n=735/>trophe. They stopped when they reached the lane, and a few minutes Vv^ere spent in conversation, — 
   <lb n=736/>quick and hurried, — as though they feared that some superior force would suspend their operations. 
</p>
<lb n=737/>
<p>
   <lb n=738/>It was a duel scene. The ground wasmeasured ; the frail form of C and the tall person of T 
</p>
<lb n=739/>
<p>
   <lb n=740/>took their assigned station as the principal actors in the tragedy about to be enacted. Their weapons 
   <lb n=741/>■were handed them, and each intent upon the horrid purpose of taking his brother's life, prepared to 
   <lb n=742/>send his stained soul into the presence of a pure God. 
</p>
<lb n=743/>
<p>
   <lb n=744/>It was a moment of dread suspense. Hearts were beating then which might soon cease to pulsate 
   <lb n=745/>forever. The shrine of many a holy affection and feeling, which if properly cultivated would have 
   <lb n=746/>led them to honor and happiness, might soon be irreparably destroyed. The sun which should soon 
   <lb n=747/>salute the earth with his blessed light, would look upon the happy homes of their childhood, where 
   <lb n=748/>they had been caressed by the fondness of parents and friends, and where they were still remembered 
   <lb n=749/>"with the kindest solicitude. Perhaps his first rays would greet an afleclionate mother in her chamber, 
   <lb n=750/>mingling the most fervent petitions for her son's happiness with her morning orisons; and that son 
   <lb n=751/>might be lost to her for ever. With quick succession, such thoughts passed through their fevered 
   <lb n=752/>brain. A moment — a report — and the deed was done. C was wounded and fell. The re- 
   <lb n=753/>mainder of the party, influenced by a dastardly cowardice wliich deserves to be branded, fled with 
   <lb n=754/>precipitation. 
</p>
<lb n=755/>
<p>
   <lb n=756/>There lay the dying one, alone. The stream of his heart's blood was gurgling through the wound, 
   <lb n=757/>and as he fell with his head down a declivity, it rushed through his throat, choking him with it&amp; 
   <lb n=758/>warm current. It was vain to struggle with death. He had challenged the monster to the combat, 
   <lb n=759/>and now felt his inabihty to meet him. And then to die in such a situation \- — with no kind friend 
   <lb n=760/>to support the drooping head, and wipe the death-damp from the brow. Doubtless as he entered the 
   <lb n=761/>dark avenue to the other world, fond memory presented the bright images of past joys, of kind sisters, 
   <lb n=762/>of affectionate friends. In vain the earth put on her vernal robe, — he had looked upon her beauties. 
   <lb n=763/>for the last time. It is painful to be ushered into the eternal world under any circumstances; but 
   <lb n=764/>how terrible it is when we rashly tear aside the curtain which veils that future state of existence 
   <lb n=765/>iirom us, and read upon the broad orb of eternity, our own condemnation. 
</p>
<lb n=766/>
<p>
   <lb n=767/>A melancholy fate is recorded of T . Warned by the spirit of his murdered companion, he 
</p>
<lb n=768/>
<p>
   <lb n=769/>left his native country, and sought to banish his painful feelings by visiting foreign lands. 
</p>
<lb n=770/>
<p>
   <lb n=771/>Ccelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt. The image was still before him : it abode 
   <lb n=772/>Twith him in private, followed him in public, and glared fearfully upon him in his midnight dreams. 
   <lb n=773/>It preyed upon his mind until settled dejection took place, which finally terminated in decided in-» 
   <lb n=774/>sanity. A wild maniac, he roamed over Italy. The balmy breath of her zephyrs brought no calm 
   <lb n=775/>to his soul ; he regarded not the famous softness of her sky. He, who had been nursed upon the 
   <lb n=776/>lap of luxury, depended on the cold charity of those to whom he was bound by no tie but that of 
   <lb n=777/>common humanity; his haughty spirit was broken, and the pround superstructure of his mind was a 
   <lb n=778/>desolate ruin. He laid him in that stranger land, where no kind friend could pen his epitaph.

<p>
   <lb n=826/>If you have hitherto escaped the grasp of the sheriff's officers, if the cuffs of your sleeves have not 
   <lb n=827/>yet been defiled by the bailiff's touch, you can form no conception of the bitterness of an arrest. It 
   <lb n=828/>is one of those unspeakable sensations which you will not again experience, save in Tartarus; thatis^ 
   <lb n=829/>if old Minos shall think fit to condemn you. A few days ago, I was still free in that anomalous liberty, 
   <lb n=830/>which knoweth not the clear light of heaven, and defendeth itself from the sun. Ferreted out by the 
   <lb n=831/>commercial blood-hound, I was forced early in the morning from my ensconcement in a garret, where 
   <lb n=832/>I was sleeping, neither well nor ill, until such time as it would be day with me, and still night witli 
   <lb n=833/>the rest of mankind. Last Friday, as the town clock was striking eight — 
</p>
<lb n=834/>
<p>
   <lb n=835/>" The owl is commencing its flight," said a young woman, (the confidante of my misfortiisse,) 
   <lb n=836/>through the key-hole. 
</p>
<lb n=837/>
<p>
   <lb n=838/>" Thanks, blue-eyed angel, with black hair," I replied, in aromantic tone of voice ; " since the ianip 
   <lb n=839/>of heaven is extinguished, the cat may go out upon the gutters." 
</p>
<lb n=840/>
<p>
   <lb n=841/>With these words, I put on a light surtout, and directed my uncertain steps toward the Palais Eoy- 
   <lb n=842/>al. Arrived near the bank, I mechanically cast my eyes upon the playbills of the day. 
</p>
<lb n=843/>
<p>
   <lb n=844/>"Theatre de Madame — First representation of 'The Setting of the Sun.' Comedy vandeTiDe;

</p>
<lb n=846/>
<p>
   <lb n=847/>Capital ! My instinct as a debtor irresistibly hurried me to such a representation. I entered pre- 
   <lb n=848/>cisely as the curtain rose, and took the first seat that offeied. 
</p>
<lb n=849/>
<p>
   <lb n=850/>Aigentieres was just like myself, a night-bird; invited to a soiree, it there chances that he forgets 
   <lb n=851/>himself, amid punch and the card-tables. At the rising of the sun he dares not venture into the 
   <lb n=852/>streets, for he has perceived from the window a visage of bad omen : 't is that of a sheriff-officer, 
   <lb n=853/>planted at the door of the hotel like a gibbet, and awaiting his victim with fatal vigilance. It was 
   <lb n=854/>necessary, then, that Argentieres should devise a thousand pretexts for remaining at his post till even- 
   <lb n=855/>ing. 
</p>
<lb n=856/>
<p>
   <lb n=857/>"How shall I manage"!" exclaimed Perlet. 
</p>
<lb n=858/>
<p>
   <lb n=859/>His embarrassing position drew from me an exclamation and sympathetic applause. My right 
   <lb n=860/>hand neighbor, a very troublesome fellow, applied his glass and eyed my countenance with an im- 
   <lb n=861/>pertinence truly provoking. I silently contented myself with turning my back to him, and offering^ 
   <lb n=862/>a more befitting view; but the fellow, whose gaze partook somewhat of the satanical, ceased notfrcirj 
   <lb n=863/>his scrutiny of my person ; above all, at that moment when the v/inding-up of the piece extracted a 
   <lb n=864/>new burst of sympathy. My patience was exhausted, and I gave him an intentional push, hy acci- 
   <lb n=865/>dent. 
</p>
<lb n=866/>
<p>
   <lb n=867/>" My dear sir! your address," said he to me, while re-adjusting his glass, which had been deraugedl 
   <lb n=868/>by my abrupt motion. 
</p>
<lb n=869/>
<p>
   <lb n=870/>" Ah! very well," added he, reading the name and number of my street; "you shall see me, sir, 
   <lb n=871/>early to-morrow morning." 
</p>
<lb n=872/>
<p>
   <lb n=873/>" You will oblige me, sir, by coming very early." 
</p>
<lb n=874/>
<p>
   <lb n=875/>" I shall not fail, I assure you." 
</p>
<lb n=876/>
<p>
   <lb n=877/>And as we quitted each other his glass was still pursuing me. I slept ill ; I am no coward, hut a 
   <lb n=878/>duel occasions restlessness even to the man most philosophically detached from life. At six o'clock 
   <lb n=879/>came a knock at my door; it was the quizzing-glass fellow, accompanied by two gentleman of a sx^~

   <lb n=969/>'Twill but vex the shut grief in our eyes I 
</p>
<lb n=970/>
<p>
   <lb n=971/>For this murder of those that we cherish'd ; 
   <lb n=972/>Whose life in her selfishness perish'd, 
   <lb n=973/>May she love, and be answcr'd with scorn, 
   <lb n=974/>And her heart with vain cravings be torn ! 
   <lb n=975/>Which to glut, with mere limb may she mate, 
   <lb n=976/>And then sicken with loathing and hate; 
   <lb n=977/>Whilst the life which her blood must allume, 
   <lb n=978/>Doth but gasp thro' one breath to the tomb, 
   <lb n=979/>And she drag on from mori'ow to morrow, 
   <lb n=980/>To lorn death thro' a desert of sorrow ! 
</p>
<lb n=981/>
<p>
   <lb n=982/>But, if by the love she will vow, 
   <lb n=983/>Which deep in her young blood doth grow, 
   <lb n=984/>And which springeth, and springeth, and springeth 
   <lb n=985/>And grace all about her forihbringeth — 
   <lb n=986/>Never more, with a merciless hand.

   <lb n=989/>At God's will, in the breath of his sky; 
   <lb n=990/>And the beam and the dew of our birth 
   <lb n=991/>Still feel as we wither in earth — 
   <lb n=992/>We revoke every spell of our curse ; 
   <lb n=993/>And its tenor heart-blighting reverse ;

   <lb n=1024/>much of the romantic and picturesque as Botafogo Bay, one of the many parts which unite to con-

<p>
   <lb n=1027/>Brazil, justly styled the garden of the world, has no spot equally fair with tliis, and while wan-

   <lb n=1037/>tains covered with perpetual verdure, high among which the towering corcovado rears its head, like 
   <lb n=1038/>a blasted pine in a grove of beauty; groves of orange trees, filled with the "golden apple" scattered 
   <lb n=1039/>in every direction by the tasteful and profuse hand of nature, give a rich beauty and softness to the 
   <lb n=1040/>scene, while in bold relief are seen the massy Gavia and the well known sugar-loaf, nature's hand- 
   <lb n=1041/>marks, to guide the weary mariner to the " haven where he would be :" all that is wanting to com-

   <lb n=1048/>ted. 
</p>
<lb n=1049/>
<p>
   <lb n=1050/>The shores of Botafogo Bay are lined with villas of surpassing beauty and neatness of architecture ; 
   <lb n=1051/>among which stands pre-eminent that of the late beautiful Countess of Santos, a monument at once 
   <lb n=1052/>of the fiailty of its fair occupant and the munificence of her imperial lover, Pedro the First.

<lb n=1053/>
<p>
   <lb n=1054/>I have been thus particular in the description, or rather in this poor attempt at description, of this 
   <lb n=1055/>lovely spot, from its being the scene of the events I am about to narrate ; and as the facts upon which 
   <lb n=1056/>this " ower true tale" are founded, did actually occur. I might in compliance with the long observed 
   <lb n=1057/>rule of scribbling, premise, " that the actors in the drama, or some of them, being still alive, delicacy 
   <lb n=1058/>forbids me to disclose their names, etc." Such, I believe, is admitted to be a privilege of long stand- 
   <lb n=1059/>ing, and I might be disposed to avail myself of it, but for the simple reason, that I do not know the 
   <lb n=1060/>real names of any one mentioned in my story, although I once heard them ; nor do I know whether 
   <lb n=1061/>they are ahve or dead, but I think I hear my fair reader exclaim, (while more than half inclined to 
   <lb n=1062/>throw away this nonsense,) the story, sir, the story ; thus, then it is : 
</p>
<lb n=1063/>
<p>
   <lb n=1064/>In the year 18 — ; but before I proceed any farther, I ought to tell you how I became acquainted 
   <lb n=1065/>with the facts I relate, and begging the pardon of any one, whose patience has accompanied me thus 
   <lb n=1066/>far, for drawing a little more upon their stock thereof, I will, in as brief a way as possible, state the 
   <lb n=1067/>the how, when, and where. 
</p>
<lb n=1068/>
<p>
   <lb n=1069/>It was on an evening of surpassing loveliness, such as is no where seen but in the tropics, that 
   <lb n=1070/>after having spent a day of solitude in my hammock, trying by inactivity and passiveness to escape 
   <lb n=1071/>the heat, as the thermometer had been playfully ranging from 90° to 100° in the shade, with no 
   <lb n=1072/>society but my Byron, my own thoughts, (poor company, I think I see you preparing to remark, so

</p>
<lb n=1077/>
<p>
   <lb n=1078/>that I will save you the trouble by confessing it myself,) and though last, by no means least, a choice 
   <lb n=1079/>"Havana," the which I can confidently recommend to every one, as the greatest of luxuries in a 
   <lb n=1080/>warm climate, where was I, oh ! I had just got out of my hammock, (another luxury,) and deter- 
   <lb n=1081/>lermined to enjoy to the utmost the coolness of the evening. I entered my canoe, and with my only 
   <lb n=1082/>attendant, (cook, valet, and chambermaid, " trio juncta in uno'' as Sheridan said,) paddled down the 
   <lb n=1083/>harbor from my cottage on the Island of Cobras, until we arrived at the mouth of Botafogo Bay, 
   <lb n=1084/>which we entered ; whilst paddhng round the bay and resigning myself to the control of spirit en- 
   <lb n=1085/>gendered by the fairy like appearance of the scene, I observed a white cross painted upon the rocks, 
   <lb n=1086/>which near the entrance of the bay, reach to the water's edge. 
</p>
<lb n=1087/>
<p>
   <lb n=1088/>Having never before noticed it, I was considerably astonished at the sight, as these crosses are 
   <lb n=1089/>usually the "memento mori's" of some murder that has been committed on the spot where they are 
   <lb n=1090/>erected, and I could not believe that the hand of the assassin would have invaded a sanctuary like 
   <lb n=1091/>this. 
</p>
<lb n=1092/>
<p>
   <lb n=1093/>On inquiry, I gained from my companion, a venerable Brazilian, the following particulars, which 
   <lb n=1094/>I give you rendered into English, and stripped of numerous digressions on his part, during the nar- 
   <lb n=1095/>ration, which would most certainly not interest you, any more than I fear mine have. 
</p>
<lb n=1096/>
<p>
   <lb n=1097/>In the year 18 — , the Martini palace which was located a short distance from Botafogo bay, in the 
   <lb n=1098/>direction of the city of Rio de Janeiro, was not more celebrated for its grandeur and magnificence, 
   <lb n=1099/>than for its owner, the Marquis Juan de Martini ; — cold, haughty, and reserved in his manners, he 
   <lb n=1100/>was liked by no one ; secluded almost altogether from the world, he appeared to feel no interest in 
   <lb n=1101/>any one around him, and but for one circumstance, the fact of his existence even would have been 
   <lb n=1102/>forgotten, so rarely did he appear in public. Like Jeptha, he had one fair daughter, and her he did 
   <lb n=1103/>indeed love passing well. 
</p>
<lb n=1104/>
<p>
   <lb n=1105/>Isabel de Martini had long been celebrated as the fairest of the fair, in the imperial city of St. 
   <lb n=1106/>Sebastian; her dark eye beaming with intelhgence, was surmounted by a brow of perfect symmetry, 
   <lb n=1107/>and her raven locks playing loosely about her sculptured neck, gave her an almost elf-like appearance. 
   <lb n=1108/>Beauty cannot be described, and any description would fall short of what Isabel really was; let every 
   <lb n=1109/>one draw from his imagination for her image, for she was lovely as imagination can conceive ; would 
   <lb n=1110/>that I could do so, but although a worshipper of the fair daughters of Eve, almost to idolatry, I never 
   <lb n=1111/>yet could transfer their charms to paper : sirffice it then to say, that among all the dark eyed beauties 
   <lb n=1112/>of this sunny land, who stand unrivalled both for form, and face, Isabel de Martini shone pie- 
   <lb n=1113/>eminent. Many were the admirers, and among them many of the proudest nobles of Brazil, who 
   <lb n=1114/>had sued for the honor of her hand, and all in vain ; to all she turned an inattentive ear, and if the 
   <lb n=1115/>truth must be told, the fair Isabel was just the least in the world of a coquette, and however much 
   <lb n=1116/>her vanity might be flattered by seeing her train of admirers swelling with the noble and the rich, 
   <lb n=1117/>she passed along unmoved by any, " fancy free." 
</p>
<lb n=1118/>
<p>
   <lb n=1119/>Pass over a year in the life of our heroine, and go with me to the shores of the bay I have de- 
   <lb n=1120/>scribed to you ; the moon was shining with its silvery light upon the still waters of the bay, which 
   <lb n=1121/>clearly as a mirror, reflected all around it, yet no object Was reflected half so fair as the forms of Isabel 
   <lb n=1122/>and a young man, who, with his arm around her, was gazing on his companion with an expression 
   <lb n=1123/>of the deepest afl'ection. Long they walked, and if we do not give you the subject of their conver- 
   <lb n=1124/>sation, it is for the two-fold reason, that being lovers, it was necessarily of a character uninteresting 
   <lb n=1125/>to a third person, and moreover, I did not hear a word of it; time flew, but still they strolled along 
   <lb n=1126/>the tranquil margin of ihe bay, and it was the lady who first observed the lateness of the hour, and 
   <lb n=1127/>spoke of returning. 
</p>
<lb n=1128/>
<p>
   <lb n=1129/>" Do not detain me longer," she said, " indeed, indeed, Fernando, I must leave you ; my absence 
   <lb n=1130/>will be remarked, and though for myself I care not, still your safety as much as my own, demands 
   <lb n=1131/>that we should be prudent ; indeed we must separate, but 'tis only till to-morrow." 
</p>
<lb n=1132/>
<p>
   <lb n=1133/>" Dearest Isabel," replied her lover, " how can I ever sufliciently repay you 1 you, the admired of 
   <lb n=1134/>all, the loveliest of your sex, thus to brave all for me — and must we part? would that the time were 
   <lb n=1135/>come, when we will fly together far from this hated place, and secure from all pursuit, live only for 
   <lb n=1136/>each other." 
</p>
<lb n=1137/>
<p>
   <lb n=1138/>" Once more, then," said Isabel, "good night; for my sake, be careful of yourself, and remember 
   <lb n=1139/>that my existence is dependant upon yours. God bless you, good night." 
</p>
<lb n=1140/>
<p>
   <lb n=1141/>The youth folded her in his arms, and hastily impressed a kiss upon her brow, which was of a 
   <lb n=1142/>marble paleness, and .then releasing her, the maiden disappeared among the rocks; he gazed after 
   <lb n=1143/>her for a few morirents, then casting off" the fastening of a canoe, which lay concealed in a small cove 
   <lb n=1144/>beneath, he sprang into it, and rapidly plying his paddle, in a very brief space he reached the op- 
   <lb n=1145/>posite shore, and disappeared. As the scene just described may appear a little strange to those whose 
   <lb n=1146/>patience has carried them thus far, it v;iil be proper to state the particulars of the acquaintance 
   <lb n=1147/>which had arisen between our heroine, and the evident object of her choice. 
</p>
<lb n=1148/>
<p>
   <lb n=1149/>At a public ball given by the Emperor, to which not only the nobility, but all the respectable in- 
   <lb n=1150/>habitants of Rio were admitted, the fair Isabel was as usual the cyrrosure of all admirirrg glances ; 
   <lb n=1151/>and while to all their flattering speeches she turned an inattentive ear, she was much struck with 
   <lb n=1152/>the appearance of a young stranger, who although not belonging to her own rank in life, was evident-

<p>
   <lb n=1158/>ly one of " nature's noblemen," and she secretly acknowledged to herself that had any of her previous 
   <lb n=1159/>admirers but resembled him, her heart had not been so difficult to subdue; — never had she ex- 
   <lb n=1160/>perienced such sensations as those which now possessed her, and she was pleased, although unable 
   <lb n=1161/>to define the cause, to observe that he was evidently gazing upon her with an eye of sincere admira- 
   <lb n=1162/>tion. 
</p>
<lb n=1163/>
<p>
   <lb n=1164/>He was the son of a captain in the Imperial Army, who had fallen in the service of his country, 
   <lb n=1165/>and had left his son wholly dependant upon his own exertions for support. Long had he gazed 
   <lb n=1166/>with admiration amounting to idolatry, upon the lovely Isabel, whom he had often seen in pubhc ; 
   <lb n=1167/>never before, however, had he been thrown so directly into the society of one, whom, he felt, to see 
   <lb n=1168/>was to love ; and now that he could at leisure gaze upon those charms, he resigned himself to the 
   <lb n=1169/>control of his passion, and with a thrill of transport, observed that his admiration was noticed, and 
   <lb n=1170/>was evidently not disagreeable to its object. The last person noticed by Isabel, on leaving the ball, 
   <lb n=1171/>was the stranger, whose eyes were still intently fixed upon her, and if a responsive glance fiom her 
   <lb n=1172/>met his eye, who shall blame her 1 
</p>
<lb n=1173/>
<p>
   <lb n=1174/>In this country, where intrigue is the chief business of life, but little difficulty occurred in his con- 
   <lb n=1175/>veying to his " lady love" the intelligence that he lived but for her; and it would be tedious to nar- 
   <lb n=1176/>rate the manner in which he obtained his first interview with her. The greatest difficulty which 
   <lb n=1177/>arose was lespecting the place of meeting, until chance disclosed to them a path leading through the 
   <lb n=1178/>mountains from the Martini palace to the bay ; there in the face of heaven, alone, the lovers met in 
   <lb n=1179/>the still hour of midnight, and with the resplendent moon, and all the heavenly •' isles of light" alone 
   <lb n=1180/>for witnesses, told their love, and spoke of future happiness. 
</p>
<lb n=1181/>
<p>
   <lb n=1182/>Much difficulty attended their meetings, as it was necessary for Isabel to await the retiring of all 
   <lb n=1183/>the family, before she could leave her chamber, which she was enabled to do by means of a private 
   <lb n=1184/>door, communicating with the garden. Anxiously would she remain in the solitude of her apart- 
   <lb n=1185/>ment, until the entire cessation of noise within the house, bade her fly to her appointment ; then in 
   <lb n=1186/>her lover's arms, with no thought for aught on earth save him, in whom were centred all the resist- 
   <lb n=1187/>less feelings of her heart, would she be for a time completely happy ; as few will deny, that the en- 
   <lb n=1188/>joyments (and especially those of this description,) of which we partake by stealth, are more intense 
   <lb n=1189/>than those which we possess sanctioned by all around us. 
</p>
<lb n=1190/>
<p>
   <lb n=1191/>Thus had they met in secret, for several months, and now only awaited the sailing of a vessel, 
   <lb n=1192/>whose captain (convinced of the propriety thereof, by the argument of a well filled purse) had con- 
   <lb n=1193/>sented to receive them on board, and carry them to some far distant land, where secure from oppo- 
   <lb n=1194/>sition, and revenge, they might be happy in each other. But I am delaying the catastrophe too long, 
   <lb n=1195/>and will forthwith proceed to the denouement. 
</p>
<lb n=1196/>
<p>
   <lb n=1197/>To enable Isabel to carry into efifect her plans for meeting her lover, it had been necessary for 
   <lb n=1198/>her to make a confidante of a servant, whom she believed to be devotedly attached to her ; avarice, 
   <lb n=1199/>however, reigned triumphant in her soul, and she betrayed the secret to her mistress' father, for a 
   <lb n=1200/>sum of money. His rage at learning the disgrace thus brought upon his house, for as such he con- 
   <lb n=1201/>sidered it, cannot be described. 
</p>
<lb n=1202/>

</head>
<lb n=1206/>
<p>
   <lb n=1207/>He determined at once upon a terrible revenge ; that he might be certain of the fact, he had fol- 
   <lb n=1208/>lowed Isabel on this, their last night of meeting, and unseen, had been a witness of the lover's in- 
   <lb n=1209/>terview; he could scarcely restrain himself from at once rushing upon, and destroying the devoted 
   <lb n=1210/>lover, but he did so, and returned to his palace with the fixed resolve, that this meeting should be 
   <lb n=1211/>their last. 
</p>
<lb n=1212/>
<p>
   <lb n=1213/>On the following night, he took measures to detain his daughter in conversation for an hour be- 
   <lb n=1214/>yond the appointed time, and several of his servants were stationed at the place of meeting with 
   <lb n=1215/>orders to assassinate the unfortunate object of his wrath, on his arrival. 
</p>
<lb n=1216/>
<p>
   <lb n=1217/>At the appointed hour, Fernando hastened on the wings of love, to meet his mistress ; another 
   <lb n=1218/>night of beauty seemed to hallow his intent : nature was at rest, and the bright moon shone . coldly 
   <lb n=1219/>down, only to light him to his death ; with a light heart he entered his canoe, crossed the bay, and 
   <lb n=1220/>arrived on the opposite shore ; before he had time to notice and wonder at the absence of his mistress, 
   <lb n=1221/>the assassins' daggers were in his heart ; he died with her name upon his lips, and leaving him where 
   <lb n=1222/>he fell, the murderers fled. 
</p>
<lb n=1223/>
<p>
   <lb n=1224/>The moment that Isabel could disengage herself from her father, she humed to her room, and re- 
   <lb n=1225/>gardless of her former caution, flew to her appointment; her father watched, and at a distance fol- 
   <lb n=1226/>lowed her ; she soon reached the spot, and oh ! what a sight of horror met her eye ! hei lover, whom 
   <lb n=1227/>she last saw in all the radiant pride of beauty and of youth, now lay dead before her, pierced with 
   <lb n=1228/>many wounds, and covered with his blood ; she threw herself frantically beside him, hoping that 
   <lb n=1229/>some spaik of life might still be unextinguished. Such hopes, however, were in vain ; and as the 
   <lb n=1230/>thought flashed upon her that she had been betrayed, she gave herself up entirely to the horror and 
   <lb n=1231/>anguish of the moment ; it was but for an instant, however, for rising rapidly, she rushed with a 
   <lb n=1232/>frantic scream to the water's edge, and throwing herself into the depths beneath, which possessed no 
   <lb n=1233/>terrors for her, she sank to rise no more.

<p>
   <lb n=1239/>Her father had followed her to enjoy the sight of the betrayer of his house, (as he supposed,) 
   <lb n=1240/>lying dead before her, and to upbraid his daughter with the dishonor she had brought upon him. He 
   <lb n=1241/>was too late, he arrived but in time to see her sink beneath the wave.

<lb n=1345/>

<lb n=1347/>
<p>
   <lb n=1348/>There lies in the north of England a considerable tract of land, now known by the name of the 
   <lb n=1349/>Waste Lands, which once formed the richest property of two wealthy families by whom untoward 
   <lb n=1350/>circumstances had caused it to be deserted. For some time, it was looked after by stewards, too much 
   <lb n=1351/>bent upon profiting themselves to regard the interests of their employers. The tenantry, who, drain- 
   <lb n=1352/>ed of their hard earnings, were obliged to vex the land till it became a bed of stones, dropped off one 
   <lb n=1353/>by one. The hedge-rows, being unremittingly assisted in the progress of decay by the paupers of 
   <lb n=1354/>the neighborhood, were soon reduced to nothing but dock-weeds and brambles ; which gradually 
   <lb n=1355/>uniting from the opposite ends of the fields, the property became a huge thicket, too encumbered 
   <lb n=1356/>ever to be worth clearing, and only valuable to poachers and gypsies, to whom it still affords abundant 
   <lb n=1357/>booty and a secure hiding place. 
</p>
<lb n=1358/>
<p>
   <lb n=1359/>The two mansions have kept pace in ruin with the lands around them. The persons left in charge 
   <lb n=1360/>of them, being subject to no supervision, put themselves but little out of their way to preserve that 
   <lb n=1361/>which was so lightly regarded by the owners. Too careless to repair the dilapidations of time and 
   <lb n=1362/>the weather, they were driven, by broken windows and rickety doors, from office to office, and from 
   <lb n=1363/>parlor to parlor, till ruin fairly pursued them into the grand saloon ; where the Turkey carpets were 
   <lb n=1364/>tattered by hob-nails, and the dogs of the chase licked their paws upon sofas of silk and satin. In due 
   <lb n=1365/>time, the rain forced its way through the roofs, and the occupiers having no orders to stop it with a 
   <lb n=1366/>tile, the breach became wider and wider. Soon the fine papering began to show discolored patches, 
   <lb n=1367/>and display the lath and plaster which bulged through it ; then the nails which supported the family 
   <lb n=1368/>portraits gave way with their burthens; and finally, the rafters began to yield, and the inhabitants 
   <lb n=1369/>wisely vacated the premises in time to avoid the last crash, rightly conjecturing that it was useless 
   <lb n=1370/>to leave the moveables behind to share in the common destruction, when there was so little likelihood 
   <lb n=1371/>of their ever being inquired after. 
</p>
<lb n=1372/>
<p>
   <lb n=1373/>Thus ended the pride both of HeronclifT and Hazledell, which may still be seen, from each other, 
   <lb n=1374/>about a mile apart, shooting up a few parti-colored walls from their untrimmed wildernesses, and 
   <lb n=1375/>seeming, like two desperate combatants, to stand to the last extremity; neither of them cheered by a 
   <lb n=1376/>sign of Ufe, excepting the jackdaws which sit perched upon the dead tips of the old ash trees, and 
   <lb n=1377/>the starlings that sweep around at sunset in circles, within which the country folks have rarely been 
   <lb n=1378/>hardy enough to intrude. 
</p>
<lb n=1379/>
<p>
   <lb n=1380/>The last possessor who resided at Hazledell was an eccentric old bachelor, with a disposition so 
   <lb n=1381/>composed of kindness and petulance, that every body liked, and scarcely any one could live with him. 
   <lb n=1382/>His relations had been driven away from him, one after the other ; — one because he presumed to 
   <lb n=1383/>plead the poverty of a tenant whom the old man had previously resolved upon forgiving his rent ; 
   <lb n=1384/>another, because he reserved the choice bin of the cellar when wine was prescribed for the sickness 
   <lb n=1385/>of the poor; and a third, because he suffered himself to be convinced in politics, and destroyed a fair 
   <lb n=1386/>subject for arguments which were intended to afford time to his company for discussing their good 
   <lb n=1387/>cheer. 
</p>
<lb n=1388/>
<p>
   <lb n=1389/>There was but one person who understood him, and this was his nephew; who continued to the 
   <lb n=1390/>last his only companion, and kept him alive solely by knowing how to manage him. He had the 
   <lb n=1391/>good taste never to remind him of his years by approaching him with that awe which is commonly 
   <lb n=1392/>demonstrated by young people towards the old ; and the tact to observe exactly where his foibles 
   <lb n=1393/>would bear raillery, and where they required sympathy. He could lead him from one mood to another,

<lb n=1398/>
<p>
   <lb n=1399/>so thai the longest day in his company never seemed monotonous ; oi if he rambled away amongst 
   <lb n=1400/>the neighborhood, he could return at night with a tale of adventures which sent him to bed without 
   <lb n=1401/>repining at the prospect of to-mwrow. Unluckily the old man considered him too necessary to his 
   <lb n=1402/>comforts to part with him ; and though merely the son of a younger brother, without fortune or ex- 
   <lb n=1403/>pectations, he was not permitted to turn his mind to a profession, or to any thing beyond the present. 
   <lb n=1404/>The youth, however, was scarcely twenty -three ; and at such an age, a well-supplied purse for the 
   <lb n=1405/>time being leaves but little anxiety for the future. 
</p>
<lb n=1406/>
<p>
   <lb n=1407/>With a good education, picked up as he could by snatches, a sprightly disposition, and a talent 
   <lb n=1408/>equal to any thing, young Vibert of Hazledell was as welcome abroad as he was at home; and it 
   <lb n=1409/>■was argued that his handsome figure and countenance would stand him in the stead of the best pro- 
   <lb n=1410/>fession going. The young ladies would turn from any beau at the country-ball to greet his arrival, 
   <lb n=1411/>and never think of engaging themselves to dance till they were quite sure that he was disposed of. 
   <lb n=1412/>One remarked upon the blackness of his hair, another upon the whiteness of his forehead; and the 
   <lb n=1413/>squires who weie not jealous of him would entertain them with his feats of horsemanship and adroit- 
   <lb n=1414/>ness at bringing down, right and left. Still Vibert was not spoiled ; and the young ladies pulled up 
   <lb n=1415/>their kid gloves till they split, v^'ithout making any visible impression upon him. His obstinacy was 
   <lb n=1416/>quite incomprehensible. Each ridiculed the disappointment of her friend, in the hope of concealing 
   <lb n=1417/>her own ; and all turned for consolation to the young master of Heroncliff. 
</p>
<lb n=1418/>
<p>
   <lb n=1419/>Marcus of Heroncliif, was nearly of an age with Vibert, and was perhaps still more popular with 
   <lb n=1420/>the heads of families, if not with the younger branches ; for he had the advantage of an ample fortune. 
   <lb n=1421/>His person, also, was well formed, and his features were, for the most part, handsome ; but the first 
   <lb n=1422/>had none of the grace of Vibert, and the last had a far different expression. His front, instead of 
   <lb n=1423/>being cast in that fine expansive mould, was contracted and low, and denoted more cunning than 
   <lb n=1424/>talent. His eye was too deeply sunk to indicate openness or generosity ; and the tout ensemble gave 
   <lb n=1425/>an idea of sulkiness and double-dealing. It was held by many that his outward appearance was not 
   <lb n=1426/>a fair index of his disposition, which was said to be liberal and good-natured. The only fault which 
   <lb n=1427/>they found with him was, that his conversation seemed over-much guarded for one of his age. He 
   <lb n=1428/>appeared unwilling to show himself as he really was, and the greatest confidence which could be re- 
   <lb n=1429/>posed in him produced no corresponding return. He walked in society like one who came to look 
   <lb n=1430/>on rather than mix in it ; and although his dependants lived in profusion, his table was rarely en- 
   <lb n=1431/>livened save by the dogs which had been the companions of his sport. 
</p>
<lb n=1432/>
<p>
   <lb n=1433/>Vibert, whose character it was to judge always favorably, believed that his manner and mode of 
   <lb n=1434/>life proceeded from the consciousness of a faulty education, and a mistrust of his capacity to redeem 
   <lb n=1435/>lost time. He felt a friendliness for him, bordering upon compassion ; and their near neighborhood 
   <lb n=1436/>affording him frequent opportunities of throwing himself in his way, a considerable degree of intimacy 
   <lb n=1437/>was, in course of time, established between them. Vibert was right, as far as he went, in his esti- 
   <lb n=1438/>mate of his friend's mind ; but he never detected its grand feature. Marcus was sensible that he was 
   <lb n=1439/>below par amongst those of his rank, and a proud heart made him bitterly jealous of all who had the 
   <lb n=1440/>advantage of him. It was this that gave verity to the expression which we have before noticed in 
   <lb n=1441/>his features; made him a torment to himself; and rendered him incapable of sympathising with 
   <lb n=1442/>others. If a word were addressed to him, he believed that it was designed to afford an opportunity 
   <lb n=1443/>of ridiculing his reply; if he chanced to be contradicted, his visage blackened as though he felt that 
   <lb n=1444/>he had been insulted. Vibert, so open to examination, was the only person whom he did not suspect 
   <lb n=1445/>and dread. They hunted, shot, -and went into society together ; and it was observed that Marcus lost 
   <lb n=1446/>nothing by the contact. His confidence increased, his reserve in some degree disappeared, and 
   <lb n=1447/>Vibert secretly congratulated himself on having fashioned a battery to receive the flattering attentions 
   <lb n=1448/>from which he was anxious to escape. His ambition, indeed, was otherwise directed. 
</p>
<lb n=1449/>
<p>
   <lb n=1450/>At a few miles' distance from Hazledell was a pretty estate, called Silvermere, from a small lake, 
   <lb n=1451/>■which reflected the front of the dwelling and the high grounds and rich timber behind it. It was 
   <lb n=1452/>inhabited by persons of consideration in the county, who were too happy at home to mix much with 
   <lb n=1453/>their neighbors. In fact, of a numerous family, there was but one daughter old enough to be in- 
   <lb n=1454/>troduced; and she was of a beauty so rare, that theie was little danger in keeping her upon hand 
   <lb n=1455/>until her sister was of an age to accompany hei into society. 
</p>
<lb n=1456/>
<p>
   <lb n=1457/>In this family, Vibert had been for some time a favorite, and had been fascinated on his first in- 
   <lb n=1458/>troduction to it. The beauty of whom we have made mention, and her sister, a year or two younger, 
   <lb n=1459/>■were placed on either side of him ; and it was hard to know whether most to admire the wild tongue 
   <lb n=1460/>and laughing loveliness of the younger — the fair-haired Edith ; or the retiring, but attractive dignity 
   <lb n=1461/>of the black eyes and pale fine features of the elder — the graceful Marion. They were, perhaps, both 
   <lb n=1462/>pleased to see the hero of the county conversations , but the younger one was the foremost to display 
   <lb n=1463/>it ; without being a flirt, she was frank, and had the rare, natural gift of saying and doing what she 
   <lb n=1464/>pleased without danger of misconstruction. 
</p>
<lb n=1465/>
<p>
   <lb n=1466/>The daring but femmine gaiety of this young creature speedily dispelled from the mind of Vibert 
   <lb n=1467/>all idea of his recent acquaintance. On his showing any recollection of it, she assured him that, on 
   <lb n=1468/>her part, the acquaintance was by no means recent, for she had heard him discussed as often as any 
   <lb n=1469/>Knight of the Round Table.

   <lb n=1477/>neighborhood, and your dinner to be five miles off, you will condescend to take advantage of us.

   <lb n=1479/>if they had not such a well grown family, are by no means rigid, exacting, fault-finding, and dis- 
   <lb n=1480/>agreeable, like papas and ■mammas in general. They have had the good taste to discover our precose 
   <lb n=1481/>talents, and profit by being our companions instead of our rulers, from the time we learned the art 
   <lb n=1482/>of spelling words of one syllable, and doing as we were not bidden. Instead of scolding us for our 
   <lb n=1483/>misdeeds, they used to reason with us as to their propriety, and generally got the worst of the argu- 
   <lb n=1484/>ment ; so, saving that in virtue of our old companionship we make them the confidants of most of 
   <lb n=1485/>our dilemmas, they have brought us up charmingly undutiful and self-willed.

<p>
   <lb n=1487/>"As for Marion, she is a young lady erroneously supposed to be the pride of the family, who pre- 
   <lb n=1488/>sumes to regard me with a patronising complacency, and to encourage me in the idea that, one of 
   <lb n=1489/>these days, I shall really learn to talk. She is a sedate personage, who tries to reflect upon things ; 
   <lb n=1490/>but, as the same deep study has shaded her brow as long as I can recollect, I imagine that she does 
   <lb n=1491/>not often come to a conclusion. Yet the falsely-styled pride of Silvermere does not blanch her cheeks 
   <lb n=1492/>in the unwholesome atmosphere of learned tomes ; nor by spinning the globes, nor by hunting the 
   <lb n=1493/>stars. Her character is a little touched with romance, and her study is how to mend a bad world, 
   <lb n=1494/>which continues aihng in spite of her. She gives all her consolation, and half of her pin-money, to 
   <lb n=1495/>a tribe of old dames and young damsels, who, under such patronage, only pull our hedges in greater 
   <lb n=1496/>security, or add fiesh colors to the costume which is to flaunt triumphant on the fair day. The 
   <lb n=1497/>urchins whom she teaches ' to guess their lessons,' and buys off from aiding in the toils of their 
   <lb n=1498/>parents, are the most mischievous in the neighborhood ; and, in short, things go on worse and worse, 
   <lb n=1499/>and poor Marion does not know what to make of it. From the humbler world, so different from the 
   <lb n=1500/>Arcadian affair of her imagination, she turns with despair to the sphere in which she is herself to 
   <lb n=1501/>move, and shudders at the prospect of disappointment there also. Where, amongst such a community 
   <lb n=1502/>of young ladies battling for precedence, and young gentlemen vowing eternal constancy to a dozen 
   <lb n=1503/>at a time, can she look for the friend of her soul, or the more favored being who is to console her for 
   <lb n=1504/>the want of one 1 Alas, the pride of Silvermere ! with feelings so delicate that a gossamer might 
   <lb n=1505/>wound them, how can she accommodate herself to any world but that of the fairy tales which de- 
   <lb n=1506/>lighted our nursery, or expect tranquility in any place but a cloister?" 
</p>
<lb n=1507/>
<p>
   <lb n=1508/>Vibert's calls were repeated often, each one affording a pretext for another, and each visit growing 
   <lb n=1509/>longer than the last. The father of his two attractions was required frequently by his affairs in 
   <lb n=1510/>London, where he spent weeks at a time, and their mother was generally confined by delicate health 
   <lb n=1511/>to her chamber. Thus Vibert's intimacy with them had but little ceremony to restrain its rapid 
   <lb n=1512/>advancement ; and he soon felt, what has perhaps been felt by many, that the simple smile of the 
   <lb n=1513/>dignified and retiring is more perilous than the brightest glance of wit and vivacity. Indeed, Edith 
   <lb n=1514/>was too gay to be suspected of any thought beyond that of amusement ; but the actions of Marion 
   <lb n=1515/>were more measured, and her approbation was the more flattering. Vibert laughed when he en- 
   <lb n=1516/>countered the first; but his pulse beat quicker at the sight of the last. 
</p>
<lb n=1517/>
<p>
   <lb n=1518/>There seems in the affairs of the heart to be an unaccountable intelligence, by which, without the 
   <lb n=1519/>use of external signs, the tremors of the one generally find their reverberation in the other. Often 
   <lb n=1520/>as Vibert entered to share in the morning amusements of the sisters, to give an account of the horse 
   <lb n=1521/>that he was breaking in for Marion, or the dog that he was teaching antics for Edith, it was im- 
   <lb n=1522/>possible for him to be insensible to an increasing flush of satisfaction at his appearance, and by de- 
   <lb n=1523/>grees he gave up all other society, and had no pastime to which Marion was not a party. Both 
   <lb n=1524/>young, both interested in the other's happiness, it was not likely that they should reflect how the 
   <lb n=1525/>brightest flowers may be the seat of poison, and the sweetest moments the parents of miser}'. Their 
   <lb n=1526/>intimacy became more confidential ; and Edith left them more and more to themselves to seek 
   <lb n=1527/>amusement elsewhere. Still theie was no question of love. Vibert knew that, without fortune or 
   <lb n=1528/>expectations, he could have no jKetension to Marion : and that the number of her young brothers and 
   <lb n=1529/>sisters must render it impossible for her father to remedy the deficiency. It was then that he felt the 
   <lb n=1530/>extent of the sacrifice he had made in devoting himself so entirely to his uncle. Had he adopted any 
   <lb n=1531/>profession, he might have obtained a home of his own, to say the least ; and, however humble that 
   <lb n=1532/>home might have been, would Marion have shrunk from it 1 Would Marion have failed to make it 
   <lb n=1533/>the richest spot upon earth 1 He was yet only of an age when many commence their career ; his 
   <lb n=1534/>mind was too active and too brilliant to suffer his habits to become ao fixed but that he could turn 
   <lb n=1535/>them to any thing. He determined upon breaking the matter to his uncle; and, as Edith was now 
   <lb n=1536/>eighteen, and the sisters were just about to appear in public, there was no time to be lost. If Marion 
   <lb n=1537/>were not to go forth with a hand already engaged, what had he not to apprehend! Fortune and 
   <lb n=1538/>honors would be at her feet — friends would reason — parents might command — and what had she to 
   <lb n=1539/>reply 1 She loved an idler who lived upon another's bounty, and whose future means were some- 
   <lb n=1540/>thing worse than precarious ! He seized upon what he thought a good opportunity, the same 
   <lb n=1541/>evening. His uncle was enjoying his arm-chair and slippers beside an ample fire, to which the pat- 
   <lb n=1542/>tering of a November storm gave additional comfort.

<lb n=1547/>
<p>
   <lb n=1548/>" Vibert,*" said he, " what have been youi adventures to-day 1" 
</p>
<lb n=1549/>
<p>
   <lb n=1550/>" I have been to Silvermere." 
</p>
<lb n=1551/>
<p>
   <lb n=1552/>« Folks tell me you have been there every day for the last twelvemonth — and who have you seen 
   <lb n=1553/>there]" 
</p>
<lb n=1554/>
<p>
   <lb n=1555/>« I have seen Marion." 
</p>
<lb n=1556/>
<p>
   <lb n=1557/>" Well, nephew, she is good-looking, you say; and sensible, and all that. Why do you not marry 
   <lb n=1558/>her, and bring her home to make tea for us 1" 
</p>
<lb n=1559/>
<p>
   <lb n=1560/>" Alas ! I would willingly do so, had I the means." 
</p>
<lb n=1561/>
<p>
   <lb n=1562/>"We can get over that obstacle, I think, by doubling your allowance." 
</p>
<lb n=1563/>
<p>
   <lb n=1564/>" My dear sir, you do not undeistand its full extent. Marion's family would never consent, unless 
   <lb n=1565/>she were to be the mistress of an establishment of her own." 
</p>
<lb n=1566/>
<p>
   <lb n=1567/>« We can remedy that, too, Vibert. Divide the house with me at the middle of the cellar, and 
   <lb n=1568/>brick up the communications. Divide the stables and the horses ; have new wheels and new arms 
   <lb n=1569/>to the old family rumble-tumble, and make any farther arrangements you please. You have been a 
   <lb n=1570/>good boy, to bear with a crazy old man so long, and I should not like you to be a loser by it." 
</p>
<lb n=1571/>
<p>
   <lb n=1572/>" My dear uncle, there was no need of this additional generosity to secure my gratitude, and my 
   <lb n=1573/>endeavors to prove it. I did not speak for the purpose of placing any farther tax upon you, but merely 
   <lb n=1574/>to consult you whether it were not better that I thought of some profession, by which I might attain 
   <lb n=1575/>a position in Ufe not liable to reverse." 
</p>
<lb n=1576/>
<p>
   <lb n=1577/>"A profession! — what, one that would call you away from HazledelH" 
</p>
<lb n=1578/>
<p>
   <lb n=1579/>" I fear all professions would subject me to that affliction." 
</p>
<lb n=1580/>
<p>
   <lb n=1581/>The uncle's color rose and his brow darkened. 
</p>
<lb n=1582/>
<p>
   <lb n=1583/>" Vibert leave me in my old age, when I have become entirely dependant upon him ! Vibert knock 
   <lb n=1584/>away the only crutch that props me up from the grave — bequeath me to the mercy of hired servants, 
   <lb n=1585/>with not a soul to exchange a word of comfort with me ! What fortune could you obtain which 
   <lb n=1586/>would compensate for reflections like these 1 
</p>
<lb n=1587/>
<p>
   <lb n=1588/>" Stay, nephew, and see me into my grave — the reverse which you apprehend — I never thought 
   <lb n=1589/>that you could so coldly contemplate my extinction ; but it is right and natural that you should do 
   <lb n=1590/>so. Only stay — and I promise you that I will not keep you long — I will curtail my expenses, banish 
   <lb n=1591/>my few old friends, dismiss my servants, and live upon bread and water, to save what I can for you 
   <lb n=1592/>from the estate. I cannot cause it to descend to you ; but, at all events, I can save you as much as 
   <lb n=1593/>you would be likely to make by leaving me. Yet, if it be your wish to go, even go ; I had rather 
   <lb n=1594/>you would leave me miserable, than stay to wish me dead." 
</p>
<lb n=1595/>
<p>
   <lb n=1596/>The old man had worked himself into a fit of childish agitation, and Vibert saw that argument 
   <lb n=1597/>Avas useless. 
</p>
<lb n=1598/>
<p>
   <lb n=1599/>" Uncle," he replied, with a look and voice of despair, " make yourself easy, Marion will find 
   <lb n=1600/>another husband, who will perhaps render her happier than I could, and I will remain with you as 
   <lb n=1601/>I have done hitherto." 
</p>
<lb n=1602/>
<p>
   <lb n=1603/>From this time, Vibert spared no effort to overcome his ill-starred passion, as well for Marion's 
   <lb n=1604/>sake as for his own ; seeking every possible pretext to render his visits less frequent, and to pay them 
   <lb n=1605/>in company. Marion perceived the change at the moment it took place, and, although she could 
   <lb n=1606/>not dispute its propriety, her sensibility was v/ounded to the quick. She commenced her first round 
   <lb n=1607/>of provincial gaiety with a fever at her heart, and an ominous presage of sorrow. 
</p>
<lb n=1608/>
<p>
   <lb n=1609/>The appearance of the Silvermere party formed an epoch in the annals of the county — and, as 
   <lb n=1610/>Vibert had forseen, there was not a squire of the smallest pretensions who did not address himself 
   <lb n=1611/>sedulously to make th** agreeable to them. They had little encouragement, however, in their at- 
   <lb n=1612/>tempts, excepting from Edith. Her heart was free, and her tongue was full of joy ; but Marion was 
   <lb n=1613/>looking for the return of Vibert; and the reserved glance of her eye kept flattery at a distance, and 
   <lb n=1614/>hope in fetters. Still he returned not — she never met him in society, but she constantly heard of 
   <lb n=1615/>his having been at balls and merry-maldngs where she was not. It was in the vain pursuit of his 
   <lb n=1616/>peace of mind ; and she was too generous to attribute it to any thing else. On his occasional visits 
   <lb n=1617/>of ceremony she received him as if nothing material had happened ; but the flush was gone from her 
   <lb n=1618/>cheek, and the smile that remained was cold and sickly. 
</p>
<lb n=1619/>
<p>
   <lb n=1620/>Meantime, rumor was liberal in assigning to each of the sisters her share of intended husbands, 
   <lb n=1621/>Vibert listened to the catalogue with all the trepidation of a lover who had really entertained hopes, 
   <lb n=1622/>Alas ! if that selfish principle of denying to another what we cannot enjoy ourselves be excusable in 
   <lb n=1623/>any case it is so in love. The loved object which belongs to no other still appears to be in some de- 
   <lb n=1624/>gree our own ; and fancy conjures up, in spite of us, an indefinable trust in the future, of which the 
   <lb n=1625/>total destruction falls like the blow of an assassin. It was thus with Vibert, when, after writhing 
   <lb n=1626/>long in secret anguish at the mention of any name connected with that of Marion, report from all 
   <lb n=1627/>quarters concurred in the same uncontradicted tale. Marion was receiving the addresses of Marcus 
   <lb n=1628/>of Heroncliff : of him, for whom he had himself, from motives of the purest kindness, secured the 
   <lb n=1629/>good thoughts of her family — him whom he had made the confidant of his love — him who had pro- 
   <lb n=1630/>fessed himself to be only waiting for encouragement to throw himself at the feet of her sister ! That 
   <lb n=1631/>he should have met him daily, and never hinted at the change in his intentions ! Yet might it not 
</p>
<lb n=1632/>
<lb n=1633/>
<lb n=1634/>
<lb n=1635/><head>THE WASTE LANDS. 31 
</head>
<lb n=1636/>
<p>
   <lb n=1637/>have been that he feared to inflict piin 1 Tiiat he should have deserted Edith when his conduct 
   <lb n=1638/>had imphed all that was devoted ! Yet, was it not for Marion 1 But then, that Marion should have 
   <lb n=1639/>become the rival of her sister ! Yet, oh ! how soon she had overcome the remembrance of him, and 
   <lb n=1640/>how natural was it for the cold in love to become the faithless in friendship. Thus Vihert went on 
   <lb n=1641/>arguing for and against all the parties, and winding up with a forced ejaculation of — " It is nothing' 
   <lb n=1642/>to me — it is no atTair of mine." It was meant to confirm his pride, but only proved his wretched 
   <lb n=1643/>ness. 
</p>
<lb n=1644/>
<p>
   <lb n=1645/>Upon this principle, and from a sense of his want of self-possession, the name of Marion nevet 
   <lb n=1646/>passed his lips in the presence of Marcus, who, on his part, was equally silent. 
</p>
<lb n=1647/>
<p>
   <lb n=1648/>The report upon which this conduct was adopted was not so destitute of reason as those which 
   <lb n=1649/>had preceded it. Marcus, with the failing already noticed, was incapable of being a true friend ; 
   <lb n=1650/>and, though at his first introduction at iSilvermere, the marked intelligence between Marion and 
   <lb n=1651/>Vibert reduced him to the necessity of devoting his attentions to Edith, yet the circumstance of her 
   <lb n=1652/>sister's preference for another was sufhcient to kindle in his heart the most burning anxiety to obtain 
   <lb n=1653/>her for himself. "Without considering Vibert's earlier acquaintance, he felt himself eclipsed, and his 
   <lb n=1654/>honor wounded. The moment, therefore, that his friend's visits were discontinued, his own were 
   <lb n=1655/>redoubled. They were naturally, from his previous behavior, laid by the family to the account of 
   <lb n=1656/>Edith; and, upon this conviction, Marion often used him as a protection against the advances of her 
   <lb n=1657/>unwelcome host of admirers. If she was asked to dance, she was engaged to Marcus ; and his arm 
   <lb n=1658/>was always ready to conduct her to her carriage. It was observed that she received much more of 
   <lb n=1659/>his attention than was bestowed upon her sister; and insensibly their manner in public became the 
   <lb n=1660/>practice in private, where there was no need for it. His hopes rose high, and he scrupled not to 
   <lb n=1661/>advance them by endeavoring to extirpate the last kind feeling which he thought might yet linger 
   <lb n=1662/>for poor Vibert. One while he affected chagrin, and invented excesses on the part of his friend as 
   <lb n=1663/>the cause of it : at another time he was incensed at injurious words, which he alleged to have been 
   <lb n=1664/>employed by Vibert towards heiself. At last, when he thought himself quite secure, he disclosed his 
   <lb n=1665/>passion, and was rejected with astonishment. 
</p>
<lb n=1666/>
<p>
   <lb n=1667/>The sting, for one like him, had a thousand barbs : he loved the beautiful Marion with all the 
   <lb n=1668/>energy of a soul which had never before loved a human being. Common report, and his confidence 
   <lb n=1669/>in her resentment against Vibert, had made him consider her as already his own. His triumph over 
   <lb n=1670/>all the competitors that he had feared, envied, and detested, was, as he deemed, on the eve of com- 
   <lb n=1671/>pletion ; and now he was to be the object of derision and mock pity ! The means which he had 
   <lb n=1672/>used to ingratiate himself would probably be divulged. The inmost core of his heart would be ex- 
   <lb n=1673/>posed and scorned ; and Vibert, whom he felt to be the latent cause of his rejection, was, perhaps, 
   <lb n=1674/>finally to be reinstated, and to flaunt his triumph daily before his eyes ! The very evils which bad 
   <lb n=1675/>minds have attempted to inflict upon others, become a provocation to themselves: they have been de- 
   <lb n=1676/>feated, and therefore they have been injured ; and the rejected suitor returned home pallid and quiver- 
   <lb n=1677/>ing with an ague fit of mortal hate. 
</p>
<lb n=1678/>
<p>
   <lb n=1679/>The attentions of Marcus had never been discussed between the sisters until the occurrence of this 
   <lb n=1680/>'catastrophe. He left them in a shaded alley of the pleasure-grounds, which were beginning to be 
   <lb n=1681/>strewed with the yellow leaves of autumn ; and a clouded sunset cast a few long streaks across the 
   <lb n=1682/>sward, and made the deep recesses look still more sombre. 
</p>
<lb n=1683/>
<p>
   <lb n=1684/>There are few who do not feel a melancholy peculiar to this period of the year. Marion had a 
   <lb n=1685/>double reason; for it Avas about the same time in the preceding autumn, and in the summer-house 
   <lb n=1686/>but a few steps before her that she had passed the last happy hour with Vibert ! 
</p>
<lb n=1687/>
<p>
   <lb n=1688/>" Marion," said Edith, as they walked on, with their arms fondly resting upon each other's neck, 
   <lb n=1689/>" you are not well. It is long since you were well ; but I had hoped that the attachment of Marcus 
   <lb n=1690/>would have dispelled a deep grief, of which you forbade me ever to speak. I trusted that your heart 
   <lb n=1691/>had been arrested in its progress of sorrow, and I was silent, lest you should think me jealous of my 
   <lb n=1692/>sweet rival." 
</p>
<lb n=1693/>
<p>
   <lb n=1694/>" Heavens ! that my apathy should have been so great as to mistake his intentions. I only bore 
   <lb n=1695/>with him because I thought him yours." 
</p>
<lb n=1696/>
<p>
   <lb n=1697/>" Marion, I never should have wished him loved by yoii, had I not felt that your life depended on 
   <lb n=1698/>the diversion of your thoughts. I have been mistaken ; you have been dying daily, and, unless you 
   <lb n=1699/>would have me die with you, let me write to Vibert. Sweet Marion, let me write, as from myself, 
   <lb n=1700/>in my own wild way, merely to bid him come and dance on my birthday." 
</p>
<lb n=1701/>
<p>
   <lb n=1702/>"No, Edith, no. He would suspect the reason; it is too humihating. I have still pride enough 
   <lb n=1703/>left to save me from contempt, if not to support me from Edith, let us talk of other things." 
</p>
<lb n=1704/>
<p>
   <lb n=1705/>She leaned her head upon her sister's bosom, and both were weeping, when they were startled by 
   <lb n=1706/>the gallop of a horse, and a ring at the garden gate. Edith saw that it was the servant of Vibert, 
   <lb n=1707/>and she sprang hke a fawn to inquire his commission. He brought a letter for Marion, and thus it 
   <lb n=1708/>ran: 
</p>
<lb n=1709/>
<p>
   <lb n=1710/>" The relations who stood between me and the succession to the estates of Hazledell are deaa. I 
   <lb n=1711/>am now my uncle's heir; but I fear too late. The sorrow of withdrawing myself to my proper dis 
   <lb n=1712/>tance when I was poor is probably to be followed up by the anguish of being forbidden to return now

   <lb n=1721/>with Marcus — till you bid me look forward to a termination of the misery which a feeling of honor 
   <lb n=1722/>&lt;2'bliged me to inflict upon myself." 
</p>
<lb n=1723/>
<p>
   <lb n=1724/>Marion sank for support against the ivy-twined pillar of the summer house. Edith kissed her pale 
   <lb n=1725/>«heek, and fondly whispered, " I told you so : what answer will you sendl" After the first moments 
   <lb n=1726/>of tremulous agitation — after an interval of silence, to lull the tumults of her heart, Marion merely 
   <lb n=1727/>ejaculated, " Poor Vibert ! I thought he had forgotten me !" 
</p>
<lb n=1728/>
<p>
   <lb n=1729/>"Bather say, poor Edith," replied her sister, with a burst of that natural gaiety which had of late 
   <lb n=1730/>almost forsaken her ; " poor Edith has now the willow-wreath all to herself. Alas ! for some 
   <lb n=1731/>doughty champion to twine it round the neck of the false lord of HeronclifT! 
   <lb n=1732/>" Here — here is a pencil — the servant waits for a reply." 
</p>
<lb n=1733/>
<p>
   <lb n=1734/>Marion tore the back from her letter, and wrote — " The reports are unfounded — the future is in 
   <lb n=1735/>3':our power." 
</p>
<lb n=1736/>
<p>
   <lb n=1737/>" Edith !" she said, when the messenger was dismissed, " give me your arm back to the house, for 
   <lb n=1738/>I feel faint. In the midst of all this happiness, there is a sickness at my heart — a strange boding, 
   <lb n=1739/>that I am only tantalized by chimeras, and meant for misfortune. Perhaps I deceive myself. Per- 
   <lb n=1740/>haps it is only the strange bewilderment occasioned by this revolution in all that interests me. I can- 
   <lb n=1741/>not help it." 
</p>
<lb n=1742/>
<p>
   <lb n=1743/>It was a gusty and querulous night. The old trees by their window groaned as though they were 
   <lb n=1744/>ia trouble, and the scud swept along the sky like a host of spectres, Marion's distressing fancies 
   <lb n=1745/>were not to be calmed, and grew even more excited by the restless and apparently preternatural 
   <lb n=1746/>spirits of her sister, who discussed their prospects in her wildest vein. She arranged that when 
   <lb n=1747/>Marien became the lady of Hazledell, she also was to call it her home, make herself the sole object 
   <lb n=1748/>of attraction and tournament to all the squires round about, and display her true dignity by remain- 
   <lb n=1749/>ing a scornful lady and a respectable maiden aunt. By degrees, her fancy ceased castle-building — 
   <lb n=1750/>■a few unconnected sparks of vanity grew fainter and fainter, and she dropped asleep. Marion had 
   <lb n=1751/>no wish or power to repose; her nervous sense of apprehension continued to increase; she tried 
   <lb n=1752/>every effort to direct her thoughts toother subjects, but they invariably became entangled, and again 
   <lb n=1753/>pressed with a dead weight upon her heart. In this mood she v/as startled by Edith laughing in her 
   <lb n=1754/>sleep, with a sound which terrified her. 
</p>
<lb n=1755/>
<p>
   <lb n=1756/>" Edith !" she cried, shaking her till she partially awoke ; " Edith — you frighten me — why do you 
   <lb n=1757/>laugh in your sleep V 
</p>
<lb n=1758/>
<p>
   <lb n=1759/>" I laughed," replied Edith, drowsily, and scarce knowing what she said, "I laughed at some one 
   <lb n=1760/>who preached to me of the vanity of human expectations." She again muttered a laugh, and a second 
   <lb n=1761/>iime diopped asleep. 
</p>
<lb n=1762/>
<p>
   <lb n=1763/>Notwithstanding the note of Marion, the night at Hazledell had seemed to bring with it a sense 
   <lb n=1764/>■of sadness, no less than it had done at Silvermere. Vibert's uncle had retired to rest with an ominous 
   <lb n=1765/>feeling of distress at the news of his deceased relations. After a while he had come back to shake 
   <lb n=1766/>hands with him again. The young ones, he said, were dropping about him, and leaving him desolate 
   <lb n=1767/>to lament the luckless humors which had impeded him from adding to their comforts as he might 
   <lb n=1768/>have done. Every joint of him trembled lest he should live too long. " God bless you, Vibert !" 
   <lb n=1769/>he added, " you have always been a good boy, and have borne kindly with my infirmities — God bless 
   <lb n=1770/>you ! God bless you ! Vibert, you will go to-morrow to Silvermere ? I have long prevented you 
   <lb n=1771/>from being happy, and you owe me no thanks that you arc so at last. Go to bed — you have grown 
   <lb n=1772/>thin from want of sleep ; and it is all my fault." 
</p>
<lb n=1773/>
<p>
   <lb n=1774/>He quitted him again with affectionate and almost childish reluctance ; and Vibert paced his room, 
   <lb n=1775/>in a fever of anticipation, till the rising of the sun, which had seemed as if it never meant to rise 
   <lb n=1776/>again. It was still too early to set out for Silvermere, but he knew that Marcus rose with the dawn 
   <lb n=1777/>for his field-sports, and his generous mind was unwilling to lose an instant in acknowledging and 
   <lb n=1778/>asking pardon for the suspicions which he had entertained of his friendship. He walked rapidly to 
   <lb n=1779/>Heroncliff, and found Marcus, as he had anticipated, up and dressed; in fact, he had passed the night 
   <lb n=1780/>■in the same manner as he himself had done, and his face looked haggard and wild. 
   <lb n=1781/>-" Marcus," said Vibert, " I come to tell you a piece of strange news " 
</p>
<lb n=1782/>
<p>
   <lb n=1783/>■■"J know it already," replied Marcus, with an attempt to look glad. " I met your servant going to 
   <lb n=1784/>'^SilvfiTOiere with it. Your uncles in India are dead." 
</p>
<lb n=1785/>
<p>
   <lb n=1786/>" I scarcely recollect them, and it would therefore be ridiculous to affect much grief for their loss; 
   <lb n=1787/>but the circumstance has been the means of showing me an injustice committed against yourself, at 
   <lb n=1788/>which I am sincerely grieved. I believed that you entertained an intention of supplanting me in the 
   <lb n=1789/>love of Marion; and although my reason had nothing to object to it, my heart felt that it was not 
   <lb n=1790/>the part which I would have acted towards you. I have accused you bitterly; but see, Marion has 
   <lb n=1791/>herself exculpated you ; and you must even forgive me as one who has been too unhappily bewilder- 
   <lb n=1792/>ed to be master of himself." 
</p>
<lb n=1793/>
<p>
   <lb n=1794/>Marcus took his offered hand and laughed, but with a fearful expression, which he strove to hide 
   <lb n=1795/>casting his eyes on the ground. 
   <lb n=1796/>-&lt;' Then Marion," he observed, " looks forward to being the lad}' of Hazledell 1"

   <lb n=1802/>"Ay, and to do the honors of it to her sister, the lady of Heroncliff. My son shall many your 
   <lb n=1803/>daughter, and we will join the estates in one." 
</p>
<lb n=1804/>
<p>
   <lb n=1805/>Marcus drew in his breath with a harrowing sound. 
</p>
<lb n=1806/>
<p>
   <lb n=1807/>" Vibert," he said, " we had best remain unmarried ; we are more independent to pursue our 
   <lb n=1808/>pastimes : we are not obliged to receive the society which is odious to us ; and, whilst we are free, 
   <lb n=1809/>we are the more welcomed abroad. Promise me you will think no more of it." 
   <lb n=1810/>■ " You would not ask it, if you felt, like me, that you were beloved by Marion. What do I care 
   <lb n=1811/>for independence and my reception abroad, when I have such a thraldom and such a paradise at 
   <lb n=1812/>home !" 
</p>
<lb n=1813/>
<p>
   <lb n=1814/>" You are determined, then ■?" 
</p>
<lb n=1815/>
<p>
   <lb n=1816/>" Can you doubt it 1 I am even now on my way to Silvermere. I should arrive too soon on 
   <lb n=1817/>horseback, and am therefore obliged to walk, for I cannot be easy till I find myself on my way 
   <lb n=1818/>thither. Come, take your gun, and accompany me." 
</p>
<lb n=1819/>
<p>
   <lb n=1820/>" I will accompany, in the hope of dissuading you, and bringing you back before you arrive there." 
   <lb n=1821/>" And I will drag you into fetters whether you will or not. Come ; it is time (o start, if we would 
   <lb n=1822/>be there by breakfast-time. What ails you 1 You look pale and shivering, this morning ; and see, 
   <lb n=1823/>for the first lime in your life, you have forgotten your gun." 
</p>
<lb n=1824/>
<p>
   <lb n=1825/>With that he kindly took it from where it stood, and presented it to him. 
   <lb n=1826/>" I will not take it," said Marcus, vaguely ; " I am nervous, and cannot shoot." 
   <lb n=1827/>" Tut, man ; take your gmi, I say ; a good shot will put you in spirits. There is an outlying deer 
   <lb n=1828/>from Hazledell in the Black Valley, and you must kill him for our wedding feast." 
</p>
<lb n=1829/>
<p>
   <lb n=1830/>Marcus bit his white lips, and did as he was bidden ; and the companions set out upon their walk. 
</p>
<lb n=1831/>
<p>
   <lb n=1832/>The weather was still gusty and uncertain. The faint gleam of the sun was rapidly traversed by 
</p>
<lb n=1833/>
<p>
   <lb n=1834/>the clouds, which seemed to overrun each other, in wild and fearful confusion. Several large trees 
</p>
<lb n=1835/>
<p>
   <lb n=1836/>■were blown across the pathways, and the crows skimmed aloft in unsettled course, as though they 
</p>
<lb n=1837/>
<p>
   <lb n=1838/>were afraid to perch. 
</p>
<lb n=1839/>
<p>
   <lb n=1840/>" How I love this bracing air !" said Vibert. " I feel as if I could fly." 
</p>
<lb n=1841/>
<p>
   <lb n=1842/>" You feel elastic from your errand. I have no such cause, and I would fain that the morning had 
   <lb n=1843/>been calmer. I think that long usage to blustering weather would have a strong effect upon men's 
   <lb n=1844/>passions, and render them too daring and reckless." 
</p>
<lb n=1845/>
<p>
   <lb n=1846/>As they descended the brow of fern and scattered plantations, from his bleak residence, his per- 
   <lb n=1847/>suasions that Vibert would return became more and more urgent. He used, in a wild, disjointed 
   <lb n=1848/>manner, all the vain arguments to which the selfish and the dissipated generally resort to dissuade 
   <lb n=1849/>their friends from what they call a sacrifice of liberty. They were easily overruled, and his agitation 
   <lb n=1850/>grew the more violent. In this manner they arrived at the entrance of the Black Valley, a gorge of 
   <lb n=1851/>rock, and varied earth, choked up by trees and bushes, chance-sown, by the birds and the winds. 
   <lb n=1852/>This valley was between two and three miles in length, its gloom was unbroken by a single habita- 
   <lb n=1853/>tion, and it had been the witness of many atrocities. It was a place usually avoided; but it was the 
   <lb n=1854/>shortest road to Silvermere, and Vibert never visited it by any other. 
</p>
<lb n=1855/>
<p>
   <lb n=1856/>" I do not like this valley !" said Marcus ; " we will take the upper road." 
</p>
<lb n=1857/>
<p>
   <lb n=1858/>" It is too far about — come on — you are not yourself this morning, and the sooner Edith laughs at 
   <lb n=1859/>you the better." 
</p>
<lb n=1860/>
<p>
   <lb n=1861/>They were making a short cut through the tangled thicket, from one path to another, and had 
   <lb n=1862/>reached a more gloomy and savage spot than they had hitherto encountered. Marcus sat down upon 
   <lb n=1863/>a piece of splintered timber, and motioned Vibert, with a gasping earnestness which was not to be 
   <lb n=1864/>disputed, to seat himself beside him. 
</p>
<lb n=1865/>
<p>
   <lb n=1866/>" Marcus," said the latter, as he complied, " your conduct is inexplicable. Why are you so 
   <lb n=1867/>anxious that I should not go to Silvermere, nor renew my acquaintance with Marion 1 You must 
   <lb n=1868/>have some reason for all this; and, if so, why conceal it from me 1" 
</p>
<lb n=1869/>
<p>
   <lb n=1870/>"If nothing short of such an extremity will induce you to follow my counsel, I must even come 
   <lb n=1871/>to it. Maiion is not what you have supposed her. You imagine that her love for you has kept her 
   <lb n=1872/>single. Ask of whom you will, if such be the general opinion. Till yesterday, she gave herself to 
   <lb n=1873/>another, who cannot aspire to a thousandth part of your merit, but who happened to be more favored 
   <lb n=1874/>by fortune. Last night, you became the richest, and she changed ; but would Vibert be contented 
   <lb n=1875/>with a partner who preferred another V 
</p>
<lb n=1876/>
<p>
   <lb n=1877/>" Marcus ! — this other ! It is of yourself you speak 1" 
</p>
<lb n=1878/>
<p>
   <lb n=1879/>" Ask all the world, if she did not make herself notorious with me. She made me distrust all 
   <lb n=1880/>womankind. Vibert, let us both leave her to the reflections of one who has deserved to be forsaken." 
   <lb n=1881/>" May it not be that you, and not I, have mistaken her 1 She might have preferred your company 
   <lb n=1882/>because you were my friend, and you might have fancied that she loved you because you loved her. 
   <lb n=1883/>It is needless to contradict me — men do not tremble and turn pale because their friends are going to 
   <lb n=1884/>marry jilts. I do not blame you; for not to love Marion is beyond the power even of fiiendship. 
   <lb n=1885/>Let us only be fair rivals, and not attempt to discourage each other by doing her injustice. Let us 
   <lb n=1886/>go hand in hand, and each prefer his suit. For my part, I promise you, that if you succeed, I will 
   <lb n=1887/>yield without enmity."

   <lb n=1893/>Marcus staggered as he rose. Vibert's countenance was grave but not unfrienJIy. 
</p>
<lb n=1894/>
<p>
   <lb n=1895/>" Go on then," said the former, in a deep broken voice, and with every feature convulsed ; at the 
   <lb n=1896/>same time, he turned himself homeward ; and Vibeit, seeing that it was advisable to part company, 
   <lb n=1897/>pursued his course towards Silvermere. Marcus made but a few strides and paused. He clenched 
   <lb n=1898/>his teeth, and cast a wild glance at his rifle — made one or two hesitating steps, and then bounded after. 
</p>
<lb n=1899/>
<p>
   <lb n=1900/>Long and intense was the watch which the sisters kept that morning in the direction of the Black 
   <lb n=1901/>Valley, but no one was seen to come forth from it. 
</p>
<lb n=1902/>
<p>
   <lb n=1903/>" In other times," said Marion, " Vibert could arrive to breaifast, and it is now long past noon." 
</p>
<lb n=1904/>
<p>
   <lb n=1905/>Edith was not mistress of the gay consolation which had so often turned a tear to a smile, and 
   <lb n=1906/>framed an excuse out of the wild and stormy weather, which it was evident her own heart could 
   <lb n=1907/>not admit. 
</p>
<lb n=1908/>
<p>
   <lb n=1909/>"He did not use to mind stormy weather," returned Marion. " Besides, we heard a shot fired, 
   <lb n=1910/>and we know that no one has the range of the Black Valley but Vibert and his friend Marcus." 
</p>
<lb n=1911/>
<p>
   <lb n=1912/>" It was, perhaps, only the cracking of some time-worn stem, giving way to the hurricane ; and, 
   <lb n=1913/>if it was a shot, we must take into consideration the peculiar nature of our cavaliers of the world, 
   <lb n=1914/>and make allowance for what they cannot help. How can we suppose that Vibert could pass the 
   <lb n=1915/>Badger's Bank without paying his compliments to the wild cat, or enjoying the shriek of the bird 
   <lb n=1916/>of prey that comes thither to tear his victim 1 He will be here to dinner, and make amends for his 
   <lb n=1917/>slowness by a strange tale of the wonders which caused it." 
</p>
<lb n=1918/>
<p>
   <lb n=1919/>" Edith, you are drawing the character of Marcus — this is not like Vibert." 
</p>
<lb n=1920/>
<p>
   <lb n=1921/>" Well, well, then — do not speak with such a tremor, and he shall be a bright exception ; and the 
   <lb n=1922/>only punishment he shall have is to be dismissed from your mind, just whilst I tell you why I have 
   <lb n=1923/>been thinking of the faithless Marcus. Do you listen 1 Yes. Why, then, dear Marion, I must 
   <lb n=1924/>have you guess the reason for my sage determination to obtain reverence as a maiden-aunt." 
</p>
<lb n=1925/>
<p>
   <lb n=1926/>" Edith !" 
</p>
<lb n=1927/>
<p>
   <lb n=1928/>" Yes, yes — I see you have guessed aright. 'Tis a false-hearted but, Marion, he was my first ; 
</p>
<lb n=1929/>
<p>
   <lb n=1930/>and to be deserted for you is not a crime which makes him an absolute monster. Come away from 
   <lb n=1931/>this window, and let us rest our eyes, for they have followed the battling of the kites and crows till 
   <lb n=1932/>Tve grow giddy, and dreamy, and fanciful. Come, come, my bride of Hazledell, and listen to the lost 
   <lb n=1933/>T?its of the soon undisputed pride of Silvermere." 
</p>
<lb n=1934/>
<p>
   <lb n=1935/>It was late in the day when they joined the rest of the family, and still no tidings had been heard 
   <lb n=1936/>of Vibert. There was a silence in the circle which proved that their uneasiness was not confined 
   <lb n=1937/>to themselves, and presently the consternation was completed by the mysterious countenance of a 
   <lb n=1938/>servant who called out his master. Marion and Edith clasped each other's neck in the sure presen- 
   <lb n=1939/>timent of something fatal. The truth was less cruel than their suspense, for though communicated 
   <lb n=1940/>with all the care and tenderness which its nature required, it left them insensible to the horrors of 
   <lb n=1941/>which they had been the victims. The sisters and the two friends were doomed never to meet again. 
   <lb n=1942/>The fate of Vibert had been discovered by the game-keepers as they were taking their evening round, 
   <lb n=1943/>by the spot where he had been left bleeding and breathless by the dastard hand of his rival. That 
   <lb n=1944/>of Marcus was best known to the fiends which pursued him. 
</p>
<lb n=1945/>
<p>
   <lb n=1946/>We will not swell our history with an account of all the gradations by which a thrilling horror 
   <lb n=1947/>may settle down to a calm and lasting woe. The first news which followed the foregoing events re- 
   <lb n=1948/>lated to Vibert's uncle. His infirm frame had sunk beneath his afiliction, and he lay in the family- 
   <lb n=1949/>vault beside his unfortunate nephew. Of Marcus, nothing had ever been heard. A stranger had 
   <lb n=1950/>been found, apparently self-destroyed, in a distant part of the country, but nobody had come forward 
   <lb n=1951/>to recognize him. There was, of course, a surmise that this might have been the fugitive, Marcus, 
   <lb n=1952/>and, whether true or false, he never gave grounds for any other. 
</p>
<lb n=1953/>
<p>
   <lb n=1954/>Years passed away, but the characters of Marion and Edith resumed no more their natural tone. 
   <lb n=1955/>The last was never seen to resume her smiles, nor the first drop a tear. Their feelings had been 
   <lb n=1956/>trampled down too rudely to spring again. What were their fates eventually is an inquiry of small 
   <lb n=1957/>importance — the history of their hearts is concluded.

<lb n=1997/>
<lb n=1998/>
<p>
   <lb n=1999/>This fire is in the peninsula of Apsclieron, twenty versts from Baku, and is justly called one of 
   <lb n=2000/>the wonders of southern Russia. I have visited this spot. It is a burning desert, from the surface 
   <lb n=2001/>of which subterraneous (lames here and there issue, which are occasioned by the exhalations of the 
   <lb n=2002/>naptha. Though this fire ma}- not be eternal, yet it is extremely old, for there are traditions of the 
   <lb n=2003/>origin of simiUar phenomena* in other parts; for instance, in the Ural, on the river Mangischlak, 
   <lb n=2004/>in the village of Sulp-Aul (v. Pallas) and that which I have seen in Wallachia, on the little river 
   <lb n=2005/>Slanika, near the village of Lapatar, on Mount Klaschna. But the origin of the fire in the neigh- 
   <lb n=2006/>borhood of Baku is buried in the obscurity of the remotest antiquity. 
</p>
<lb n=2007/>
<p>
   <lb n=2008/>The first appearance of this fire, in an age when the phenomena of nature were so little known 
   <lb n=2009/>and explored, might appear supernatural. It is well known that Media was the seat of Zoroaster's 
   <lb n=2010/>doctrine, and the introduction of those mysterious receptacles of the eternal fire, which the Maho- 
   <lb n=2011/>metans every where destroyed. Only the miraculous flame of Baku arrested the blind fury of the 
   <lb n=2012/>Mahometans. The temple consecrated to fire is still preserved by the remnant of the ancient Parsees, 
   <lb n=2013/>or fire-worshippers, who, though scattered over the immense tracts of Persia and India, come hither 
   <lb n=2014/>to perform the prayers imposed on them by their vows. This temple, however, is no beautiful 
   <lb n=2015/>specimen of architecture, but a simple stone square, in the centre of which stands the altar, from 
   <lb n=2016/>which issues the eternal fire. The flat roof is supported on four columns, from which a constant 
   <lb n=2017/>fire, conducted by tubes, likewise ascends. On thg roof, above the altar, is a fittle belfry. 
</p>
<lb n=2018/>
<p>
   <lb n=2019/>On dark nights this temple is descried even at a great distance, and is the more interesting and 
   <lb n=2020/>majestic in the eyes of the traveller, as the brilliant flame does not resemble Vulcan's destructive fire, 
   <lb n=2021/>but is like some mystei:ious phenomenon awakening sublime recollections of antiquity. 
</p>
<lb n=2022/>
<p>
   <lb n=2023/>Within the wall which surrounds the temple, there are some stone houses, and a small garden, 
   <lb n=2024/>the residences of eight Parsee monks."|- During the time of worship, they strike the bell once, 
   <lb n=2025/>generally on their entrance into the temple, and then prostrate themselves before the altar. After 
   <lb n=2026/>remaining for a pretty considerable time in this position, they arise, strike the bell once more, and 
   <lb n=2027/>then finish their prayers. They give the fire the firstlings of every sort of food. They eat no meat, 
   <lb n=2028/>and live entirely on vegetables. Their particular affection to animals is probably the cause of it ; the 
   <lb n=2029/>guardians of the Holy Fire keep a great number of dogs, which they treat as friends and companions. 
</p>
<lb n=2030/>
<p>
   <lb n=2031/>It is evident that they prefer their religion to all others, and consider themselves as purer than 
   <lb n=2032/>other men, because they are favored with the purest notions of the divinity. In conversing with 
   <lb n=2033/>persons of a different religion, they protect themselves by certain prayers, which they repeat in an 
   <lb n=2034/>under voice. They seemed much displeased when my companions weie going to dress their dinner 
   <lb n=2035/>at the same fire as theirs. To satisfy them, I had the kettle removed to another part. When they 
   <lb n=2036/>carried water near us, they always cried out, Brama, Brama, Brama, doubtless to counteract our 
   <lb n=2037/>influence upon it. Perhaps they have a particular respect for water; at least, in remote antiquity, it 
   <lb n=2038/>was considered, by many of the followers of Zoroaster, as a divinity. 
</p>
<lb n=2039/>
<p>
   <lb n=2040/>The atmosphere in the temple, and in the surrounding court-yard, is very warm, on which ac. 
   <lb n=2041/>count the monks wear a very light clothing. 
</p>
<lb n=2042/>
<p>
   <lb n=2043/>It is reported that the monks, in former times, frequently made singular vows; for instance, to re- 
   <lb n=2044/>main for several years in a constrained attitude, with their arms raised, oi holding up one foot, etc. 
</p>
<lb n=2045/>
<p>
   <lb n=2046/>* They originated, at no very distant period, by the lightning having rent the upper hard layer of 
   <lb n=2047/>the mountain, which made an issue for the inflammable vapors, and, at the same time, caused the 
   <lb n=2048/>flames to arise. 
</p>
<lb n=2049/>
<p>
   <lb n=2050/>-\ The Europeans call them, as well as all other fire-worshippers, Guebers ; which seems to be a 
   <lb n=2051/>corruption of the Persian word Giaur, by which they designate all those who profess a different re- 
   <lb n=2052/>ligion. They call the Russians, Sare-Giaur, or Sare-Guebr, i. e. light brown idolaters ; probably be- 
   <lb n=2053/>cause they observe fewer persons with black hair among them, than among the people of Asia.

   <lb n=2065/>This, indeed, has ceased ; but they still endeavor, as they used to do, to prevent the women from ap- 
   <lb n=2066/>proaching the sacred fire ; probably, tliat their presence may not divert their attention. 
</p>
<lb n=2067/>
<p>
   <lb n=2068/>In every thing that surrounds them, these monks are very neat and cleanly. They have no su- 
   <lb n=2069/>perfluity, but poverty is unknown among them. Their cells are likewise lighted by the subterraneous 
   <lb n=2070/>fire; which is easily extinguished by covering the vent through which the gas issues. The verdure 
   <lb n=2071/>of the garden on the other side of the court-yard of the temple, and the delightful shade of the trees, 
   <lb n=2072/>afford these hermits a refreshing coolness. If superstition finds, in the evanescent flame, an object 
   <lb n=2073/>of adoration, no inconsiderable advantage is derived from the naplha, which is so common here, and 
   <lb n=2074/>in the neighborhood, and yields to the ciown an annual revenue of 200,000 rubles.

<lb n=2209/>
<p>
   <lb n=2210/>It was a soft evening in May, 1812, when Catharine Harman, a laJy of noble bearing, and iffl 
   <lb n=2211/>perial beauty, was stioUing in a grove of oaks that ornamented the grounds of a mansion on' the 
   <lb n=2212/>banks of the Chesapeake. Far beyond the share of the most favored was the lovehness of the lady, 
   <lb n=2213/>and the fairest of her sex in her charming presence, might have wondered at nature's partiahty. 
   <lb n=2214/>Apparently the showers of but eighteen springs had freshened the bloom of her beauty, yet the next 
   <lb n=2215/>evening her twentieth birth-day was to be commemorated at the noble mansion of her family. 
   <lb n=2216/>Fairer than all the lover dreams of paradise was the exquisite symmetry of her person. The outline- 
   <lb n=2217/>was swelling round, and softly undulating as if finished by angels from heaven's rarest models. At 
   <lb n=2218/>rest, the matchless proportions were health and beauty deified ; but in motion, best was their won- 
   <lb n=2219/>derful loveliness developed. And her walk had the imposing dignity of the high dama nurtured in 
   <lb n=2220/>the olden courts of lady-love and troubadour, combined with the elegant, the tripping simplicity of a 
   <lb n=2221/>Hebe. She stepped — oh ! she floated, joyous and inspired, as if to the voluptuous melody of an Ita- 
   <lb n=2222/>lian opera ; and as her elegant figure, traced so faint, yet so roundly full, in a rich close robe of the 
   <lb n=2223/>times, swept the long grass, noiseless as the sailing albatross, and wound among the whispering trees 
   <lb n=2224/>as a virgin cloud from the court of the moon, a painter might have sketched the portrait of a celes- 
   <lb n=2225/>tial huntress alighting in her groves. Her ankle and foot — for ah ! there is a dangerous coquetry 
   <lb n=2226/>in a pretty foot — small, and charmingly shaped — the indispensable of womanly beauty — were 
   <lb n=2227/>barely seen ere they vanished in their mysterious ambush, as if one glance were enough to enchant. 
   <lb n=2228/>Her face ! alas ! the artist's finest touch were even Apollo the artist, could not breathe its passicii, 
   <lb n=2229/>its divinity ; to look on it were to wither the heart, and give memory immortality. It was not the 
   <lb n=2230/>cherubic laughingness of the playful girl, but the matured, the superb, and fascinating loveliness of 
   <lb n=2231/>the woman. 
</p>
<lb n=2232/>
<p>
   <lb n=2233/>Her complexion was that happiest union of color, seen only in female cheeks and in the pei-fec?- 
   <lb n=2234/>tion of painting — the softest blending of the lily and the rose — yet it rivalled the fairest lily or the 
   <lb n=2235/>richest rose. Her head was of splendid mould, and hex forehead high and queenly. A few shoit 
   <lb n=2236/>curls clustered like the locust flowers on its ravishing fairness ; and waving masses of dark brown 
   <lb n=2237/>hair, straying in ringlets from under a jewelled clasp, flung their wild profusion over a neck of snow, 
   <lb n=2238/>and a bosom whose faultless contour rivalled the proudest creations of the Grecian chisel, in whicfi 
   <lb n=2239/>nothing of beauty or grace is unfinished. That glossy, voluptuous hair, was like the luxuriant sea- 
   <lb n=2240/>grass in the mermaid's bower, floating over, yet slyly showing its virgin pearls. 
</p>
<lb n=2241/>
<p>
   <lb n=2242/>The jetty eyebrow was pencilled with the rainbow's curve; her lashes were long, black, and ex- 
   <lb n=2243/>quisite ; and there was that thrilling and mystic depth of soul in her lustrous black eyes which the 
   <lb n=2244/>flower of nature's nobility only have. By turns they were soft as the houri's glance — by turns they 
   <lb n=2245/>flashed as the moonlit-rill, or beamed with the still enthusiasm of the stars. Truly the eye is the 
   <lb n=2246/>mirror of woman, for its reflection is mystery ; even in sleep it has a spell we dare not trust. 
</p>
<lb n=2247/>
<p>
   <lb n=2248/>The nose was strictly Grecian — that classic inheritance of so many fair claimants ; the sunny, 
   <lb n=2249/>oval cheek vvas a delicious repose of blushes ; and the round superb chin, when drawn proudly up, 
   <lb n=2250/>was slightly doubled. But her scarlet lip of scented ripeness — ah ! there was a witchery there that 
   <lb n=2251/>mocks the power of pen. Even anger cannot rob a woman's lip of its magic, for in its pout there rs 
   <lb n=2252/>death to the young heart. In jo3'ous love, it is a cradle of smiles tempting an impassioned caress — 
   <lb n=2253/>a fount of delicious nectar intoxicating to sip — or rather it is the honeyed altar of passionate love. 
   <lb n=2254/>But in offended pride and bridling beauty, how ravishing its toss, its quiver ! The lips of the dan- 
   <lb n=2255/>gerous Catharine Harman wore the softest smile, the rosiest pout, the proudest cuil, and in their ver- 
   <lb n=2256/>milion shadow were arrayed a set of teeth whiter than the foam of the sea. 
</p>
<lb n=2257/>
<p>
   <lb n=2258/>The expression of her countenance was difficult to define. In pensiveness, it was poetry in its 
   <lb n=2259/>richest garb ; in animation, it copied the wave of the laughing lake ; and, again, it wore that lofty some- 
   <lb n=2260/>thing, that hauteur perhaps, that springs from a noble and cultivated intellect ; but at times its.

</p>
<lb n=2265/>
<p>
   <lb n=2266/>wondrous meaning was as changeful and exhaustless as the picture of the cloud in the rippling 
   <lb n=2267/>spring. Her face was a gay masquerade of expression. 
</p>
<lb n=2268/>
<p>
   <lb n=2269/>A child of sorrow was this beautiful being — amiable as she was lovely, yet unfathomable in a 
   <lb n=2270/>passing acquaintance. Outwardly lively and dashing, she was one of that strange few who, when 
   <lb n=2271/>they list, can stand calm, dark, and unread under the scrutiny of the world, 
</p>
<lb n=2272/>
<p>
   <lb n=2273/>Grief has been said to exert a chastening influence, but some'imes it nurtures dangerous predis- 
   <lb n=2274/>positions — but of this again. At the age of fifteen, Catharine Harman had lost a sainted mother. 
   <lb n=2275/>Two years after, an only brother, led by that fever of travel and adventure so seducing to youth, had 
   <lb n=2276/>left his home, and been killed in a duel in a distant state. His blooming sister was left with but two 
   <lb n=2277/>relatives on earth — a passionate indulgent old father, and a portionless male cousin, two years her 
   <lb n=2278/>junior, who was avi-ay at college. 
</p>
<lb n=2279/>
<p>
   <lb n=2280/>The fair Kate Harman h id been brought up a pretty pet, which is to say that she was self-willed, 
   <lb n=2281/>though, like many pets, her heart was in the right place. The rose that flowers in a garden of 
   <lb n=2282/>weeds is the sweeter by contrast, for it is at once associated with some inherent excellence which 
   <lb n=2283/>defied neglect. So with the happy pet, whose innate goodness cannot be spoiled by parental indul- 
   <lb n=2284/>gence. By natural consequence of her rearing, Catharine was somewhat of a coquette. Start not ! 
   <lb n=2285/>nor cross thyself, guileless reader, for thou art generous, and coquettes are a much abused race. 
   <lb n=2286/>What a brilliant world of song and loveliness, of sighs and smiles, of tears and thrilling tones, of wild 
   <lb n=2287/>reproach, sweet repentance, and eloquent sorrow arc embodied in that single name of coquette ! At 
   <lb n=2288/>once the delighted fancy pictures a superb and accomplished female luxuriating in the " purple light 
   <lb n=2289/>of love." The very name implies beauty, talent, and amiability ; in that these alone win admiration, 
   <lb n=2290/>and by these only will gentlemen admit they are conquered. That wretched ambition, which pub- 
   <lb n=2291/>licly displays the peacock's feathers, is not the intoxicating play upon hearts of a beautiful and po- 
   <lb n=2292/>lished woman. The firat is the toy of vanity — the other, the innocent love of being loved — an evi- 
   <lb n=2293/>dence at once of overflowing kindness. This is the pleasing diflercnce between the painted flirt and 
   <lb n=2294/>the witching, glorious creature who coquettes from conscious nobleness — claiming homage as the 
   <lb n=2295/>prerogative of her heavenly nature. If her smile is a lure, (sure it is a pious fraud to lead mortals 
   <lb n=2296/>to heaven !) it honestly shows the gilded barb, and adoring man takes it with a rapture which 
   <lb n=2297/>breathes, " 'tis delicious to yield when angels tempt." Nothing in this world is half so harmless and 
   <lb n=2298/>unasking as love ; emotion so gentle and so gratuitous, cannot fiiil to awaken a regard in its object, 
   <lb n=2299/>thus bringing into play commendable exorcises of feehng. Females delight in the gentle charge of 
   <lb n=2300/>heartless coquette. 
</p>
<lb n=2301/>
<p>
   <lb n=2302/>Now, coquetry in a cottage proves at once that it is natural ; and, zounds ! who, in this christian 
   <lb n=2303/>age, will say that adored woman shall be rifled of her birthright 1 Rivalry is the soul of love, as 
   <lb n=2304/>jealousy is its test ; and tiie real lover of a dashing coquette feels a delicious uncertainty which 
   <lb n=2305/>teaches him truly to value her. He must be a happy man, who is loved by one of these captivating 
   <lb n=2306/>beings ; there must be — oh, there is — an intensity of devotion in the love that prefers him to the 
   <lb n=2307/>world of its choice. Vanity — than which no feeling is more slandered and more disinterested — 
   <lb n=2308/>shares the giddy triumph. To think that she is the queen of hearts, and he the queen's king ! Many 
   <lb n=2309/>may have heard the story of Oian al Bekar, who was the devil amongst women — a very prince of 
   <lb n=2310/>coquettes — and Zelirc, his queen. They reclined in a nuptial bower, and the prince whispered — 
   <lb n=2311/>" You are beautiful, Zelire, and love me ; I am happy, for all men envy me," and he kissed his de- 
   <lb n=2312/>lighted bride. " You love me, Oian," murmured she, "and I am happy, for all women envy me." 
   <lb n=2313/>Can a prospect of domestic felicity be more flattering 1 
</p>
<lb n=2314/>
<p>
   <lb n=2315/>To the belle in polished, or perhaps artificial society, coquetry is an armor of security — one of the 
   <lb n=2316/>acquired luxuries of society. Tears are a woman's weapons with her husband, sighs with her lover, 
   <lb n=2317/>but she must fight the cruel world with coquetry. There is less of the amiable weakness in the 
   <lb n=2318/>other sex, from lack of power ; for, alas, they all would if they could, and do as they can. Where, 
   <lb n=2319/>then, is the credit of good motives for its condemnation by gentlemen 1 Ladies seldom cast the 
   <lb n=2320/>charge on one another. 
</p>
<lb n=2321/>
<p>
   <lb n=2322/>Star-gazers may have seen before now a gay, innocent-looking cloud suddenly darken and shoot 
   <lb n=2323/>forth lightning which it seemed too gentle to have harbored. So it was sometimes with Catharine 
   <lb n=2324/>Harman, To look on her faultless face, one would have never thought it passion's throne, yet she 
   <lb n=2325/>had that flavor of prettiness called " temper." There is something " interesting," highly so, in the 
   <lb n=2326/>female of holy placidity of disposition — one whose spirit glides unruffled along the calm tide of the 
   <lb n=2327/>ocean of life, and floats into port without a gun or a flag. How sweet, how heavenly ! — yes, a little 
   <lb n=2328/>too much so for this world. That " interesting" is an equivocal compliment, at best. Give me the 
   <lb n=2329/>woman who has a leaven of mortality ; a spirited girl, who will bridle up and argue, for nothing is 
   <lb n=2330/>so surpassingly delightful as the making up of a lovers' quarrel. A lake, sheltered by mountains, is 
   <lb n=2331/>very pretty, and all that, in its sweet repose ; but w ho delights not more in the sea — the wild, ma- 
   <lb n=2332/>jestic, beautiful, and laughing sea — which also has its hours of bewitching rest 1 Oh ! the .spice of 
   <lb n=2333/>"variety ! 
</p>
<lb n=2334/>
<p>
   <lb n=2335/>Well, Catharine, in addition to the sin of coquetry, had tempei. Yet there was but one chord, 
   <lb n=2336/>waking but one tone, to but one touch. The untimely and mysterious end of her brother had 
   <lb n=2337/>wrought a perilous effect on her sensitive nature. Few feelings are so beautiful as a sister's love —

<lb n=2342/>
<p>
   <lb n=2343/>trusting as the dove in kindness returned, and, like the dove, unmurmuring in neglect. Its influence 
   <lb n=2344/>is holy and lasting ; for kw brothers of amiable sisters are ever unkind to the sex. But this theme 
   <lb n=2345/>is for gifted pens. Catharine Harman had loved her brother Charles with an intensity equalled only 
   <lb n=2346/>by its return. At the restless age of eighteen he had left his paternal roof with a hard wrung con- 
   <lb n=2347/>sent, and the first news of his wanderings was that he had fallen in a duel at New Orleans. Mourn- 
   <lb n=2348/>ful is the grief for the wanderer whose eyes are closed by strangers' hands, for it has no consolation. 
   <lb n=2349/>It seems so hard to be robbed of the last look, the parting message, of those who are dear. Had 
   <lb n=2350/>his sister drunk his last sigh, and planted the willow on his youthful grave, tears had been a luxury ; 
   <lb n=2351/>but as it was, memory had no farewell look or word to cheer its melancholy. The glad stream that 
   <lb n=2352/>has been dammed across, is slow and silent, yet at some time it will burst the barrier that gave it 
   <lb n=2353/>strength. As Catharine brooded over her brother's death, a new and powerful passion crept over 
   <lb n=2354/>her young heart — an unyielding abhorrence of duelling and duellists. This strong and absorbing 
   <lb n=2355/>feeling lit up disdain in her glance, and lent her tongue the withering eloquence of passion at the 
   <lb n=2356/>name or sight of a duellist. Each blighting sarcasm was an expiation to the shade of her brother. 
   <lb n=2357/>At such moments, how different was she from the winning Catharine, the courteous and animated 
   <lb n=2358/>belle ■? 
</p>
<lb n=2359/>
<p>
   <lb n=2360/>Gifted, accomplished, and wealthy ; at home in the graceful dance, or waking the melody of Eu- 
   <lb n=2361/>terpe from her harp ; the light of the gay saloon, and the toast of the private circle ; it was not won- 
   <lb n=2362/>derful that this brilliant favorite of nature should exercise the dangerous power of her inheritance. 
   <lb n=2363/>Many a conquered youth had knelt impassioned at the shrine of her beauty, and thought himself 
   <lb n=2364/>blessed with a tear of pity. The rich and powerful had courted her alliance ; but, with the air of 
   <lb n=2365/>an empress, she answered, " My liberty is dearer than thou." 
</p>
<lb n=2366/>
<p>
   <lb n=2367/>But the fair Kate has been walking all this time in the grove by herself. She neared the skirt 
   <lb n=2368/>of the wood that sloped to a grassy bank, and flung its image on the tide. Leaning on the trunk 
   <lb n=2369/>of an ample oak, while the leaves of a pendent bough were wooing her lips and ringlets, she put on 
   <lb n=2370/>a poetical face, and gazed musingly on the water. 
</p>
<lb n=2371/>
<p>
   <lb n=2372/>The scene was brilliant and beautiful. Mysteriously charming it is to trace the landscape's sha- 
   <lb n=2373/>dow pencilled bright as its copy in the waveless tide. Fair earth is a vain baggage, and delights to 
   <lb n=2374/>take a peep at herself, as some pretty school giil, who carries a mirror in her bosom to dress her 
   <lb n=2375/>ringlets by. There, curiously inverted in that glorious bay, stood every quiet tree and yellow cliff, 
   <lb n=2376/>the setting sun, the anchored clouds, and the bandit fish-hawk watching still by his naked nest. It 
   <lb n=2377/>was nature sketching her own portrait from her looking glass. Far from the shore, hung dizzily be- 
   <lb n=2378/>tween two heavens, sat a slight pilot schooner, raking true to her own weblike outline, on which she 
   <lb n=2379/>rested keel to keel. Here and there a stout bay craft was dozing on the crimson couch, and a thin 
   <lb n=2380/>column of smoke curled up amidships. At the distance of a mile, a gay looking ship, the palace of 
   <lb n=2381/>the cabin-king, appeared dotted with painted ports, and her sails and colors hanging sleeping in 
   <lb n=2382/>their pride. The sailor's favorite lay, " the girl I left behind me," wandered from the rigging to the 
   <lb n=2383/>shore, plaintive as an unheard farewell. Far down, a long low point stole away into the channel, 
   <lb n=2384/>with its sentinel lighthouse stark at the end; and, beyond, the blue Chesapeake rolled his funeral 
   <lb n=2385/>tide till sky and sea were blended in the enchantment of distance. Around the embowered man- 
   <lb n=2386/>sion a profusion of trees flung the mingled shade of the classic elm, the collonaded poplar, the whis- 
   <lb n=2387/>pering locust, and the lordly oak. Rows of white outhouses glanced among the foliage ; and, around 
   <lb n=2388/>the neat negro quarters, troops of noisy young " tow heads" were gamboling with dogs of all de- 
   <lb n=2389/>grees. Near by, an orchard of choice and various fruit was sending an odorous tribute to the sky ; 
   <lb n=2390/>and a spacious garden on the southern wing, with its jetting fount, its silver rill, and vine-clad bow- 
   <lb n=2391/>er, its winding walks, and delicious shrubbery, spoke the culture of a refined and finished taste. 
   <lb n=2392/>From a flowering lawn to the bay, there stretched a beautiful grove of oaks, the play ground of a 
   <lb n=2393/>pair of fawns, and the favorite stroll of their lovely mistress. It was a striking and animated picture 
   <lb n=2394/>,of southern comfort and elegance. Over all, the setting sun brushed his burnished mantle, for he is 
   <lb n=2395/>a rare and skilful artist. The exquisite blending of ray and shade, the light in gay reUef, and the 
   <lb n=2396/>mystic tints of the far blue hills, are each and all his patent of matchless artistry. 
</p>
<lb n=2397/>
<p>
   <lb n=2398/>That flow of soft delight which lovely scenery awakens in the gifted mind, stole over the lady as 
   <lb n=2399/>the floating serenade of the lute, and she murmured, " it is beautiful." 
</p>
<lb n=2400/>
<p>
   <lb n=2401/>" The scene," answered a low and melodious voice, " is insipid, for beauty is by comparison. An 
   <lb n=2402/>angel is an angel only on earth, in heaven she is but a woman. This scene is dull, for its charms 
   <lb n=2403/>have fled to deck a fairer shrine. Nature is jealous of you, peerless Catharine, as your music master 
   <lb n=2404/>was when his fair pupil excelled him." 
</p>
<lb n=2405/>
<p>
   <lb n=2406/>A graceful foim of rounded eighteen was bending before her, and a sad and handsome face beamed 
   <lb n=2407/>upon the startled lady. She knew him not, and the stranger enjoyed her confusion with silent va- 
   <lb n=2408/>nity — for there is a singular delight in the incognito of one returning among his friends after an ab- 
   <lb n=2409/>sence of years. No youth, especially at such a time, can bear to be saluted with familiar recogni- 
   <lb n=2410/>tion. That careless " how are you] why you have not changed much," is chilling enough to the 
   <lb n=2411/>fancied unknown. A stare and a distant bow are the most subtle flattery- — for vanity reads in them 
   <lb n=2412/>a change of personal appearance — for the better of course. Thus it may have been in the present

   <lb n=2420/>he was so handsome I 
</p>
<lb n=2421/>
<p>
   <lb n=2422/>"And I," again spoke the stranger, folding his aims, and bowing his head in eloquent melancho- 
   <lb n=2423/>ly, "have mused for years on that only balm of absence, remembrance of the loved, to find that I 
   <lb n=2424/>am forgotten. Would for his peace that Walter de Berrian were blessed with his cousin's forgetful- 
   <lb n=2425/>ness." 
</p>
<lb n=2426/>
<p>
   <lb n=2427/>" Walter, Walter ! my own dear cousin, I did not know you," exclaimed Catharine, quite taken 
   <lb n=2428/>by delightful surprife, as she extended her hand, and almost herself. In another moment she re- 
   <lb n=2429/>tired, sweetly confused, before the trembling and grateful gaze of the youth. iiThe easy belle was 
   <lb n=2430/>abashed, and theie was mischief in her soft confusion. The young man at her side was an orphan, 
   <lb n=2431/>tinder the guardianship of her father. Four yeais ago he left for college, a bashful stripling, whom 
   <lb n=2432/>his wild romping cousin had often kissed just to see him blush. She had read his letters, breathing 
   <lb n=2433/>a poetry of feeling which she could scarcely realize from the pen of the retiiing Walter. But Catha- 
   <lb n=2434/>line was flashing on her career of beauty and triumph, and seldom thought of her absent cousin, un- 
   <lb n=2435/>less with a wonder of ideal interest. He stood beside her now an elegant gentleman, with thought 
   <lb n=2436/>upon his brow, and soul in his sad black eye — her equal in knowledge and mind — for a moment the 
   <lb n=2437/>change embarrassed her. 
</p>
<lb n=2438/>
<p>
   <lb n=2439/>" Your hand only !" ejaculated the young De Berrian, in strangely musical tone, as the blushing 
   <lb n=2440/>lady drew back. " This is a cold meeting — a slander to our heart. Why, my cousin, if wc art glad 
   <lb n=2441/>to meet, should our joy be locked in this unmeaning shake? Why not lake counsel of our feelingsl" 
</p>
<lb n=2442/>
<p>
   <lb n=2443/>" I do," she answered, with a pretty curtesy. 
</p>
<lb n=2444/>
<p>
   <lb n=2445/>" We did not meet so once, Catharine, nor is this the greeting of kindred spirits — excuse me for 
   <lb n=2446/>complimenting myself." 
</p>
<lb n=2447/>
<p>
   <lb n=2448/>" Oh sir, since you are so disinterested, you are welcome to my share of the compliment. But 
   <lb n=2449/>•what of our meetings oncel I have'nt any memory ; you know when I used to climb that cliffyon- 
   <lb n=2450/>der for the flowers on its brink, while you were praying me to come down, I never looked behind, 
   <lb n=2451/>it made me giddy." 
</p>
<lb n=2452/>
<p>
   <lb n=2453/>"Ah it is true of all conquerors that they drown the cries of the wounded in the music of victory. 
   <lb n=2454/>But I meant, dearest cousin, that our hands formerly met after our lips — thinking they were safe in 
   <lb n=2455/>so innocent an example," returned Walter doubtfully. 
</p>
<lb n=2456/>
<p>
   <lb n=2457/>" Why then,'' answered the laughing belle, " you were a sly pretty boy, and I, a little woman, 
   <lb n=2458/>for I had already broken some dozen of hearts, and worn as many miniatures. But now you have 
   <lb n=2459/>grown so tall and handsome, with such meaning in your eyes — I — you would not have your cousin 
   <lb n=2460/>kiss a man"!" 
</p>
<lb n=2461/>
<p>
   <lb n=2462/>"No, loveliest girl! Never may that monster of beard and brutality wound my cousin's cherry 
   <lb n=2463/>lips. Reserve their dew and breath for the caress of thy softer sex and the warm touch of adoring 
   <lb n=2464/>boyhood. I am just eighteen," and, as the pleasing Walter spoke, his arm warily circled the round 
   <lb n=2465/>waist of the half-willing Catharine, and, amid slaps and stifled screams, he sought her averted lips. 
   <lb n=2466/>After a tantalizing chase, he snatched a lily hand from over the blushing fugitives, and printed upon 
   <lb n=2467/>them a long, delicious kiss. 
</p>
<lb n=2468/>
<p>
   <lb n=2469/>"How da:e you sir?" demanded Catharine, drawing up her pretty chin. 
</p>
<lb n=2470/>
<p>
   <lb n=2471/>"I am dying — my Ufe is the forfeit of my rashness." 
</p>
<lb n=2472/>
<p>
   <lb n=2473/>" See what you have made of my hair, you impudent boy !" she said with a fatal glance, as she 
   <lb n=2474/>shook out the disordered tresses. 
</p>
<lb n=2475/>
<p>
   <lb n=2476/>The youth stood as if he had suddenly waked in the bower of a Peri : and well might the exqui- 
   <lb n=2477/>site being before him have brought in question the reality of sight. The rich blood was planting 
   <lb n=2478/>roses in her superb cheeks, and through the splendid curls, that showered over hex face, he saw a 
   <lb n=2479/>pouting lip and a witching eye. 
</p>
<lb n=2480/>
<p>
   <lb n=2481/>" Saint Mary !" whispered De Berrian, as if he feared to frighten the vision, "what crime, fairest 
   <lb n=2482/>exile, did you commit in Heaven ?" 
</p>
<lb n=2483/>
<p>
   <lb n=2484/>" Theft sir," she returned with a penitent sigh. "It is my only fault; I stole Cupid's arrows." 
</p>
<lb n=2485/>
<p>
   <lb n=2486/>" Then it is no mystery that they never wound yourself," said Walter, recovering his mortality. 
   <lb n=2487/>" Fatal hirntress ! now that the stolen quiver is nearly empty, in that you have more heaux than ar- 
   <lb n=2488/>rows, you kill with the more deadly artillery of your eyes. Such is the boasted progress of refinement. 
   <lb n=2489/>Yet spare a triumph so poor as I ! Fire not from that murderous ambush again. The next glance 
   <lb n=2490/>■will read the treasured secret of years," and his head fell mournfully upon his bosom. 
</p>
<lb n=2491/>
<p>
   <lb n=2492/>" Oh ! is there a casket there that will hold a secret so long ? Give it to me, my own kind cou- 
   <lb n=2493/>sin, and I won't look death at you again," and she leaned imploringly on his arm. 
</p>
<lb n=2494/>
<p>
   <lb n=2495/>" It is yours, my adored Catharine," he murmured low and passionately, " I love you." 
   <lb n=2496/>" Love me ! I hope you do: I would not have a cousin that did not love me," She looked the 
   <lb n=2497/>sweetest surprise, and turned a demure face to the perplexed youth. 
</p>
<lb n=2498/>
<p>
   <lb n=2499/>"Roguish counterfeit, and ridiculous me !" thought he, "I must pretend innocence too. The 
   <lb n=2500/>surest lure for a butterfly is a painted rose." De Berrian had read much, seen much, and thought 
   <lb n=2501/>more. His fancy was rich, and his conversational powers of the first order. He adverted to the 
   <lb n=2502/>beautiful scenery aroimd them, and, insensibly, Catharine was drawn from her perfection of sim-

<p>
   <lb n=2508/>plicity. Her gifted cousin was spieading a rare repast with a tasteful hand, and she partook with 
   <lb n=2509/>kindred enthusiasm. They descanted on the "beauties of nature," "painting," and " music," and 
   <lb n=2510/>wept over "poetry" and tlie "jp thetics." The cousins were shining in a new and dazzling hght. 
   <lb n=2511/>They were surprised at the extent of their powers, delighted with themselves, and with each other. 
   <lb n=2512/>Love, in the natural order of events, was the next theme, and they both seemed awaie of the law,, 
   <lb n=2513/>for Walter was trembling, and playing with hu unsuspecting little hand, and Catharine gave her 
   <lb n=2514/>head the ndke droop to one side, and looked delightfully simple, 
</p>
<lb n=2515/>
<p>
   <lb n=2516/>" To me," said Walter with a speculative air, " it is inscrutable that actions and feelings should 
   <lb n=2517/>contradict each other. In this I am unblest, for my tongue is the confidant of my heart, which, as 
   <lb n=2518/>with your sex, means, that it keeps secrets by calling in assistance. Now, m.y cousin, I love you — 
   <lb n=2519/>see how my tongue betrays its faith — do you love me.^" 
</p>
<lb n=2520/>
<p>
   <lb n=2521/>" Why what do you take me for, Walter 1 Do not the laws of Lsaven and earth command us to 
   <lb n=2522/>love our relatives]" 
</p>
<lb n=2523/>
<p>
   <lb n=2524/>" Why will you not understand mel" he asked, with a passionate vehemence. " My love, beau- 
   <lb n=2525/>tiful woman, is not that calm, unanxious instinct of kindred. (Dh ! it is the freshest dew of the soul 
   <lb n=2526/>falling on its favorite rose ! Catharine, we were children together, and the youngest tendril of the 
   <lb n=2527/>vine circles the nearest flower, and it never loosens its clasp for another." 
</p>
<lb n=2528/>
<p>
   <lb n=2529/>" Beautiful," she interrupted, with enthusiasm ; " but the vine grows, puts forth other tendrils, andr 
   <lb n=2530/>the youngest is first to decay, while the poor flower has long since perished in its withering clasp. 
   <lb n=2531/>Heaven save this frail flower from such keeping !" 
</p>
<lb n=2532/>
<p>
   <lb n=2533/>" They died faithfully together — an emblem " 
</p>
<lb n=2534/>
<p>
   <lb n=2535/>" But I don't want to die, dear, I'll tell you, skeptic — I named a wreath of flowers, " love," and 
   <lb n=2536/>threw it on the stream of isles in our garden. It floated gayly on, coquetting with every wave and 
   <lb n=2537/>bough, lingering a while on the golden sands of a flowered islet, and gliding away with a promise 
   <lb n=2538/>to come back A fairer spot was ever in view — some far sweet isle, in the majesty of distance, 
   <lb n=2539/>wi'ched the loitering voyager along, till the poor withered thing of vanity was stranded on a bub- 
   <lb n=2540/>ble. First love may be sincere while it lasts, but the same beauties of person and mind, by the 
   <lb n=2541/>same impulse, will charm in another. Absence conqueis love by love's own weapons." 
</p>
<lb n=2542/>
<p>
   <lb n=2543/>"Thank you, sweet coz, for the lesson you leach; for, since my idol is the fairest and best, my 
   <lb n=2544/>faith will never be tempted." 
</p>
<lb n=2545/>
<p>
   <lb n=2546/>" Mine is not equally guarded," she rejoined laughing, " or rather I never loved. I don't believe 
   <lb n=2547/>in that lisping romance of the nursery. I have frailties enough." 
</p>
<lb n=2548/>
<p>
   <lb n=2549/>" Frailties!" said De Berrian shoitly." I cannot understand that senseless afTectation which can 
   <lb n=2550/>name the noblest passion in the gift of heaven a frailty. Yet listen, Catharine," he softened as he 
   <lb n=2551/>lip put on its haughtiness, " I know that you are kind and gentle as your fawns, for the child ne^ 
   <lb n=2552/>ver forgets the playmate of his cradle. Your bosom thrills with sympathy at the tale of sorrow, and 
   <lb n=2553/>that liquid eye is lit with heaven's light when virtue triumphs. Surely love would sue to nestle in 
   <lb n=2554/>a heart like yours. Ah! there is a remembrance, sweet with the fragiance of other years, which 
   <lb n=2555/>bids me speak. Here, under these trees, we have woven the blue hare-bells together, and you have 
   <lb n=2556/>sportingly kissed me ! O then, even then, I could have held your soft sweet lips to mine, and wished 
   <lb n=2557/>that moment eternity. Then I learned to adore you, and if there is one feeling unmixed with self, 
   <lb n=2558/>one trait that hallows frailty, it is the delicious love of early years, which blooms and smiles when 
   <lb n=2559/>the head is white, and the eye rayless. From birth my nature named you happiness, my honor was 
   <lb n=2560/>woven with you as glory, and my young ambition saw in you its heaven. Mine is the love that 
   <lb n=2561/>loves but once, and mine I offer thee." 
</p>
<lb n=2562/>
<p>
   <lb n=2563/>" Thank you," answered the beauty, in a rapture of modesty. " How proud I am of my cousin— 
   <lb n=2564/>so eloquent, so tender. I am in torment to show my triumph." 
</p>
<lb n=2565/>
<p>
   <lb n=2566/>" Is this your answer 1" demanded Walter, hastily, 
</p>
<lb n=2567/>
<p>
   <lb n=2568/>" What is the question, sir 1" 
</p>
<lb n=2569/>
<p>
   <lb n=2570/>" Do you love me 1" 
</p>
<lb n=2571/>
<p>
   <lb n=2572/>" That's not fair," she returned, sweetly ; " do you love we?" 
</p>
<lb n=2573/>
<p>
   <lb n=2574/>" Oh ! devotedly, my first and fairest," and he caught her hand, 
</p>
<lb n=2575/>
<p>
   <lb n=2576/>" Not so fast," she exclaimed, pretending surprise ; " the first flowers of spring are fairest and 
   <lb n=2577/>frailest, too. Your ofl'er is painful and unexpected ; speak of it no more." 
</p>
<lb n=2578/>
<p>
   <lb n=2579/>Yet Catharine felt proud, gratified at his long cherished aflfection, which, as a romping, teazin^ 
   <lb n=2580/>girl, she had slyly seen in a thousand adoring looks and silent rambles. As a lovely and winning 
   <lb n=2581/>belle, there lingered amid all her giddy triumphs a tender interest for her pensive cousin. His love 
   <lb n=2582/>she felt was a feeling tribute to her worth, and then he was a proud and portionless orphan. But 
   <lb n=2583/>it would never do that the hunted coquette should be won so easily. She would not admit to her- 
   <lb n=2584/>self that she loved him ; yet, as she stole a look at his faultless figure and handsome face, eloquent 
   <lb n=2585/>with vexation and disappointment, something whispered—" If ever I should love, my noble cousia

<lb n=2701/>
<p>
   <lb n=2702/>" CuESE the pale faces !" exclaimed a tall Indian who stood upon a ledge of rocks which jutted 
   <lb n=2703/>over a dark ravine, down which the mountain current whirled with the rapidity of an arrow, sound- 
   <lb n=2704/>ing like the deep and dull rumbling of distant thunder, and throwing up the spray in hazy wreaths 
   <lb n=2705/>which almost reached the ledge upon which the Indians stood. 
</p>
<lb n=2706/>
<p>
   <lb n=2707/>" Curse the pale faces ! dost thou think I can be subdued by the cubs whose dams I prostrated 
   <lb n=2708/>at my feet !" He who spoke was a tall Indian of a herculean mould, with a high and expansive 
   <lb n=2709/>forehead, and a pair of dark eyes, which glistened like the mountam tiger's as he spoke. His fea- 
   <lb n=2710/>tures were sharp and sternly set, while his shaggy eyebrows were natm-ally drawn down over his 
   <lb n=2711/>eyes, which gave to his features an ascetic expression not very prepossessing. The Indian to whom 
   <lb n=2712/>he addressed the expression, was a small man, with a narrow receding forehead, dark fieiy eyes, and 
   <lb n=2713/>a countenance the unnatural distortions of which, when he spoke, would lead a physiognomist into 
   <lb n=2714/>the mdubitable belief that this delectable individual might be one of that number whose qualms of 
   <lb n=2715/>conscience for evil deeds might be too frequent. The large Indian gritted his teeth as he finished 
   <lb n=2716/>speaking, and brandished his tomahawk towards fort Duquesne with a fearful vigor, which, with the 
   <lb n=2717/>dark scowl upon his face, caused the smaller Indian to recoil with fear. 
</p>
<lb n=2718/>
<p>
   <lb n=2719/>" 'Tis even so," at length spoke the latter, in a dry guttural voice. " The cubs have grown in 
   <lb n=2720/>strength, till they have risen to sweep us from the earth ; already have they encroached into our 
   <lb n=2721/>hunting grounds, and om- game is daily becoming less beneath their fiery weapons." 
</p>
<lb n=2722/>
<p>
   <lb n=2723/>" Let them grow ! the taller the tree grows, the easier 'tis blown dowTi by the wind," said 
   <lb n=2724/>Pontiac, (for it was he,) who gazed so intently in the direction of fort Duquesne, as not to observe 
   <lb n=2725/>the countenance of the dwarf Pishairo, which assumed a sinister smile, while his small bright eyes 
   <lb n=2726/>glittered like the enraged snake when he watches in the grass for his prey. " 'Tis said the pale war- 
   <lb n=2727/>rior would wed the daughter of Pontiac ; has the news yet reached the ear of ovur sachem 1" 
</p>
<lb n=2728/>
<p>
   <lb n=2729/>" The sachem glared upon the dwarf as if he wonld fathom his inmost thoughts, while the 
   <lb n=2730/>bitter smile which had spread over his features suddenly passed off, and a demure composure was 
   <lb n=2731/>the only expression observable. " Hast thou been among the pale faces contrary to my wishes 1 if 
   <lb n=2732/>so, better hadst thou be a snake than Pishairo," said the chief sternly through his clenched teeth, as 
   <lb n=2733/>he continued gazing upon the countenance of the dwarf. " Speak ! how comest thou by this idle 
   <lb n=2734/>talk, which would better become one of thy own kind than me V 
</p>
<lb n=2735/>
<p>
   <lb n=2736/>" I have sought thee, Pontiac, for my breast is burdened with news. Listen ! As the sun was 
   <lb n=2737/>sinking behind the mountain, and ere the birds had ceased their warbling, I beheld the pale face in 
   <lb n=2738/>his canoe, which he plied silently, scarcely disturbing the dark shadows in the waters as he passed ; 
   <lb n=2739/>he landed, and with the stealthiness of the wild cat, when he crawls upon his prey, mounted he the 
   <lb n=2740/>green bank which rises by thy mountain wigwam ; he gained the top — a low cry, and thy dark-eyed 
   <lb n=2741/>daughter " 
</p>
<lb n=2742/>
<p>
   <lb n=2743/>The fierce sachem sprang upon his feet, and fixing his fiery eyes upon the dwarf, drew back 
</p>
<lb n=2744/>
<lb n=2745/>
<lb n=2746/>
<p>
   <lb n=2747/>44 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<lb n=2748/>
<p>
   <lb n=2749/>his long spear, as if in tHe act of hurling it, while the informant crouched clo^r to th rock beneath 
   <lb n=2750/>which he sat. 
</p>
<lb n=2751/>
<p>
   <lb n=2752/>" When the Ottawa sachem discovers Pishairo's tongue forked lUie the subtle snake's, then let 
   <lb n=2753/>him strike the base blood from his heart," and the dwarf laid his hand upon his bosom, and gazed 
   <lb n=2754/>steadfastly upon the chief, who, after scrutinizmg his countenance, which was as expressionless as 
   <lb n=2755/>the cold marble, exclaimed in a voice of passion, " None of the pure blood of Pontiac shall mingle 
   <lb n=2756/>with the base blood of the pale face, unless it be in the struggle for life and death. I have said it ! 
   <lb n=2757/>Curse the white race ! Were I the father of a thousand daughters, whose eyes were as dark as the 
   <lb n=2758/>night, and whose hair were as beautiful as the raven's plumage, I would lay them all upon the dust 
   <lb n=2759/>and mingle their blood with the dirt ere it should mingle with that cursed race ! I will stand in 
   <lb n=2760/>their path, and stop their journey, or, upon the bones of my forefathers, perish," and the chief shook 
   <lb n=2761/>his spear with vehemence towards the dwarf. 
</p>
<lb n=2762/>
<p>
   <lb n=2763/>" These were words of truth," assented the small man, who still lay close to the rock, 
</p>
<lb n=2764/>
<p>
   <lb n=2765/>" Pishairo speak," said the sachem in a peremptory tone, which was not to be disobeyed. 
</p>
<lb n=2766/>
<p>
   <lb n=2767/>"The daughter of the Ottawa sachem gazed into the eyes of the pale face with those of the dove, 
   <lb n=2768/>and her voice was as soft as the nightingale when he sings to his love, as she whispered in a low 
   <lb n=2769/>voice, which reached my ear,' Thy canoe did not darken the waters last setting sun ; no ripple came 
   <lb n=2770/>to the shore from thy paddle; has the daughter of the Ottawa sachem grown cold in thine eye 1' 
   <lb n=2771/>Then spoke the pale faced chief, and his voice was like unto the silvery tones of the dark-eyed maiden, 
   <lb n=2772/>' The pale face loves the Ottawa maiden, but not for her lands — 'tis the maiden he wants, and he 
   <lb n=2773/>•would take her from this dreary forest to the bright land of his people— would the red maiden fol- 
   <lb n=2774/>low her pale lover 1' and he placed around her neck a chain made from the bright metal, as he drank 
   <lb n=2775/>from her glowing eyes the confession that she would be his own. In a mellow voice he bade her 
   <lb n=2776/>meet him at the next setting sun, and then his canoe went its noiseless way and soon disappeared ; 
   <lb n=2777/>these are not forked words." 
</p>
<lb n=2778/>
<p>
   <lb n=2779/>The eyes of the chief flashed fire, he gritted his teeth, and clenched his spear with the power of 
   <lb n=2780/>a vice, but, with that tact peculiar to him, covered the fury which raged within him under features 
   <lb n=2781/>which indicated nothing more to an observer than their usual stern and determined expression. He 
   <lb n=2782/>strode off, and the features of the dwarf again assumed their usual cunning and sinister expression. 
   <lb n=2783/>The haughty Ottawa sachem had beheld with a jealous eye the daily encroachments of the white 
   <lb n=2784/>race upon the lands owned by his tribe. His foresight told him that the power which a while pre- 
   <lb n=2785/>viously was unlimited among the tribes, was daily becoming weaker — and he already viewed, in an- 
   <lb n=2786/>ticipation, the whites as masters of the land of his ancestors, unless he adopted vigorous measures to 
   <lb n=2787/>drive them from it ere they increased to such numbers as would render futile all his attempts to ex- 
   <lb n=2788/>pel them. Already had his name ceased to create that electric effect which it was wont ere the 
   <lb n=2789/>whites came to the country, and he determined, with one sanguinary blow, to regain that mighty 
   <lb n=2790/>influence which he had lost. He was determined that his voice should again be heard with rever- 
   <lb n=2791/>ence at the council fire, and that, v\hen in his absence, his belt should summon a host of warriors 
   <lb n=2792/>to his standard, as it formerly did in the days of his glory. It is seldom we see one possessing power 
   <lb n=2793/>once, when levelled to the common standard of a private individual, who is willing to remain so ; 
   <lb n=2794/>but with the never-tiring and never-quietted passion ci'iilidon continually spurring him on, he is 
   <lb n=2795/>never satisfied, never at ease, but unceasingly engaged in plotting and counterplotting for the prize 
   <lb n=2796/>which can never be reached, till at last he expires, a victim to the passion which bums alike in the 
   <lb n=2797/>breast of the savage and the king. 
</p>
<lb n=2798/>
<p>
   <lb n=2799/>Pontiac still possessed unlimited sway over his own nation — yet the influence of the whites was 
   <lb n=2800/>also felt among his own tribe ; they did not obey his wishes with the same alacrity as previous to 
   <lb n=2801/>the appearance of the whites on their soil. The dwarf, who belonged to the Peoria nation, whom 
   <lb n=2802/>the warlike Ottawas had conquered and reduced to slavery, was a soi-disant chief: but the fate of 
   <lb n=2803/>war had not only reduced him to a private individual, but also to a slave, in which capacity he 
   <lb n=2804/>served under the Ottawa sachem ; which, after all, was more compatible with his talent than his for- 
   <lb n=2805/>mer station, which was an hereditary gift. Love and jealousy are passions which rage in a savage 
   <lb n=2806/>with more energy than in a refined bieast, and these were at this time the two predominant passions 
   <lb n=2807/>of Pishairo. He had seen Pontiac's beautiful daughter, and to see was to love; he had gazed upon 
   <lb n=2808/>her till he was intoxicated with her charms ; long and ardently had he watched her expanding wo- 
   <lb n=2809/>manhood, and, like the rose bud, so beautiful at first, now that she had expanded to maturity, ap- 
   <lb n=2810/>peared more lovely still. This amiable lover had beheld the meeting of the preceding evening, and 
   <lb n=2811/>inflamed wiih jealousy, he sought the chief, whose irritable disposition he knew could be easily 
   <lb n=2812/>fanned into a flame, particularly when the subject was the white aggressors. His object for com- 
   <lb n=2813/>municating this intelligence was the reverse of what the chief supposed it, who imagined he had 
   <lb n=2814/>Mad the countenance of the dwarf.

<lb n=2821/>
<p>
   <lb n=2822/>As the trees were gilded with the last rays of the declining sun, a canoe silently glided towards 
   <lb n=2823/>the bank upon which stood the wigwam of the Ottawa chief. The person who sat in it, and noise- 
   <lb n=2824/>lessly plied the paddle, appeared to be aware of his proximity to the hunting ground of the Ottawas, 
   <lb n=2825/>by the many anxious looks which he directed to every tangled coppice which he passed. After re- 
   <lb n=2826/>viewing well the woods from the middle of the stream, he turned the prow towards the shore, and 
   <lb n=2827/>with one or two dips of his paddle, the canoe bounded to the land ; he sprang out, and drawing it 
   <lb n=2828/>farther upon the bank, stealthily walked up the hill, observing to examine the priming of his pis- 
   <lb n=2829/>tols, which he carried in his belt, previous to commencing the ascent. He gained the top, and 
   <lb n=2830/>■whistling softly, beheld the Ottawa maiden advancing from the direction of her father's wigwam. 
   <lb n=2831/>At this moment an Indian stepped from behind a tree near the white man. 
</p>
<lb n=2832/>
<p>
   <lb n=2833/>" Ah, Pishairo, thou art here agreeably to thy promise," exclaimed the white man, as he grasped 
   <lb n=2834/>the Indian's hand, " and thou hast talked with the sachem's daughter — how can I reward thee 1" 
</p>
<lb n=2835/>
<p>
   <lb n=2836/>" Reward !" exclaimed the dwarf, as his features assumed the sardonic expression peculiar to 
   <lb n=2837/>them when he was over excited. " Thinkest thou a Peoria sachem asks reward 1 he takes it." 
</p>
<lb n=2838/>
<p>
   <lb n=2839/>" This language is enigmatical ; explain thyself, warrior," said the white man, whose face slightly 
   <lb n=2840/>reddened. " How couldst thou take thy reward unless I chose to give it ?" 
</p>
<lb n=2841/>
<p>
   <lb n=2842/>The dwarf burst out into a hysterical laugh. " Does the eagle ask the hawk for his prey "? No ! 
   <lb n=2843/>he pounces upon him and takes him" — and the dwarf walked off laughing immoderately. 
</p>
<lb n=2844/>
<p>
   <lb n=2845/>The white man gazed after him, but the Indian maiden was in his arms ere he could give vent 
   <lb n=2846/>to an expression of anger. He impiinted a kiss on her forehead, and his eyes immediately lost their 
   <lb n=2847/>expression of angei with which he gazed at the dwarf. 
</p>
<lb n=2848/>
<p>
   <lb n=2849/>" Is the Ottawa maiden ready to go to the land of the white man's people 1" 
   <lb n=2850/>The girl hung her head, and then looking him in the face with eyes beaming love, she answered, 
   <lb n=2851/>" The Ottawa maiden is ready to leave her people, and follow her white warrior to his bright land." 
</p>
<lb n=2852/>
<p>
   <lb n=2853/>" Then we will hasten ere '' and turning around, the white man beheld himself surrounded 
</p>
<lb n=2854/>
<p>
   <lb n=2855/>with Indians, who stood as many as the trees. He seized the maiden with the left hand, and with his 
   <lb n=2856/>light drew a pistol, which he discharged at the nearest Indian ; they rushed on him, but with his 
   <lb n=2857/>knife, which he brandished in the air with herculean strength, he kept the wairiors at bay, and 
   <lb n=2858/>slowly retreated towards the boat ; thiice did they rush up, and thrice did he repel them ; but finally 
   <lb n=2859/>he was overpowered by the savages, thrown upon the ground, and bound. The maiden was led to 
   <lb n=2860/>her lodge, and the while man borne to the densest part of the woods, where were erected the tents 
   <lb n=2861/>of the warriors. He was taken to a spacious tent, in which sat Pontiac and all of his oldest chiefs. 
   <lb n=2862/>A low guttmal interjection from each man as he passed, indicated their knowledge of his capture ; 
   <lb n=2863/>and then all were as silent and motionless as statues. The sachem motioned with his hand, and 
   <lb n=2864/>the white man was untied, and stood amongst them. The chief arose to address him, and from a 
   <lb n=2865/>spark of joy which appeared to twinkle in his eyes, it was evident he was striving to master feelings 
   <lb n=2866/>of exultation, which were so intense as almost to overcome him. The white man folded his 
   <lb n=2867/>arms, and looked steadfastly in the eyes of Pontiac as he spoke ; and from the fearless man- 
   <lb n=2868/>ner in which he bore himself, it was evident that he could be no uncommon person. The 'sa- 
   <lb n=2869/>chem spoke slowly and distinctly, and his words embodied that sarcasm which strikes to the soul of 
   <lb n=2870/>the addressed. 
</p>
<lb n=2871/>
<p>
   <lb n=2872/>" White man, listen ! The red man and the white man were friends ; they sat at the same coun- 
   <lb n=2873/>cil fire, and they slept upon the same blanket ; they walked the same path, and they smoked to- 
   <lb n=2874/>gether the same pipe ; they ate of the same venison, and there was peace ! White man, listen ! Ye 
   <lb n=2875/>grew in strength, (for then ye were weak) till, like the tall oak, ye fain would spread youi branches 
   <lb n=2876/>over the other trees, to guard them from the stoim ; ye are now grown high, but beware ! — none 
   <lb n=2877/>but the tallest trees are stricken by the fire of the clouds. (Every warrior grunted a commendation.) 
   <lb n=2878/>Ye grew in strength till the land which you hunted upon grew small in your eyes, and then ye 
   <lb n=2879/>would have ours. Ye taught our young warriors to drink the fire water, which drove them mad, and 
   <lb n=2880/>they were no longer warriors. Is this all ■? No ! Not content with oui lands, ye would steal upon 
   <lb n=2881/>our hunting grounds to carry off our daughter; what does the paleface merit?" The sachem's 
   <lb n=2882/>eyes twinkled like two stars as he gazed around upon the rows of warriors. 
</p>
<lb n=2883/>
<p>
   <lb n=2884/>" Curse the wild cat ! he would prey upon his red brothers," said a clear eyed old warrior, whose 
   <lb n=2885/>scalp lock was blanched with years. 
</p>
<lb n=2886/>
<p>
   <lb n=2887/>" And merits burning at the stake," said another, whose loclis were no less white. 
   <lb n=2888/>"And his bones cast to the dogs — curse him!" exclaimed a third. 
</p>
<lb n=2889/>
<p>
   <lb n=2890/>" Curse him !'' reiterated the rest in a low tone, as they involuntarily tightened their grasps 
   <lb n=2891/>around their tomahawk handles — " can the white chief find his tongue 1" 
</p>
<lb n=2892/>
<p>
   <lb n=2893/>The prisoner already knew of the mighty scheme against the whites which the sachem wag pro- 
   <lb n=2894/>jecting by his dutiful slave Pishairo, and he felt that his only chance for life would be to obtain, if 
   <lb n=2895/>possible, a protraction of his execution. He spoke firmly and frankly, and admitted what they aU 
   <lb n=2896/>leady suspected. There was no cringing beneath the stern and steady gaze of Pontiac, but he threw 
</p>
<lb n=2897/>
<lb n=2898/>
<lb n=2899/>
<p>
   <lb n=2900/>46 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<lb n=2901/>
<p>
   <lb n=2902/>it back by one equally stern and defying ; he spoke with powerful energy, for he was pleading for 
   <lb n=2903/>life; he described in glowing colors the impression the first sight of his daughter had upon him, and 
   <lb n=2904/>that he was resolved to wed her in order to cement the bonds of friendship firmer between the white 
   <lb n=2905/>and red men, 
</p>
<lb n=2906/>
<p>
   <lb n=2907/>A demoniacal smile spread over the features of the sachem when the white man had finished speak- 
   <lb n=2908/>ing ; he drew himself up to his full height, and fiercely demanded the war club — should be passed 
   <lb n=2909/>around, which was soon done, and it was decided that the prisoner should be burned at the stake the 
   <lb n=2910/>following morning. He was taken to a wigwam and firmly bound, and four lynx-eyed warriors 
   <lb n=2911/>were stationed over him, who had mingled their blood, and swore to take the life of any one of 
   <lb n=2912/>their number who should be so unfortunate as to fall asleep. 
</p>
<lb n=2913/>
<p>
   <lb n=2914/>The prisoner was the young commander of Fort Duquesne, who had a short time previous left 
   <lb n=2915/>his native country, buoyant with hope, but in an unlucky moment beheld the pretty Indian maid- 
   <lb n=2916/>en, whose native charms captivated him. None of the Indians were aware of the rank of their pri- 
   <lb n=2917/>soner save Pontiac, and a very few of the veteran chiefs and warriors, who were all anxious for his 
   <lb n=2918/>death, more that the news might intimidate the soldiers of the fort, than for the heinousness of the 
   <lb n=2919/>crime of striving to steal a girl. 
</p>
<lb n=2920/>
<p>
   <lb n=2921/>About midnight, a messenger stood before the lodge of Pishairo, who was tossing about on his 
   <lb n=2922/>blanket, a prey to the burning thoughts which tortured his brain. The Indian tore away the rude 
   <lb n=2923/>screen from before the place of entrance, and bade the dwarf arise and proceed to the council house, 
   <lb n=2924/>whither he repaired instantly. Pontiac sat at the farther end of the house, and at each side of him 
   <lb n=2925/>four chiefs, whose hair were snowy with age, and like all grave counsellors, when on duty, they sat 
   <lb n=2926/>stem and motionless, with the exception of their lips, which slightly moved as the smoke from them 
   <lb n=2927/>curled in thick wreaths over their heads. 
</p>
<lb n=2928/>
<p>
   <lb n=2929/>"Pishairo!" The dwarf stood motionless, in a listening attitude. 
</p>
<lb n=2930/>
<p>
   <lb n=2931/>" Pishairo has his ears sharpened," said he, in a firm tone. 
</p>
<lb n=2932/>
<p>
   <lb n=2933/>" Listen," said the sachem ; " travel with the wings of the dove to fort Duquesne, and bear its 
   <lb n=2934/>commanding chief this belt ; look upon it ! 'tis a broad one ! the wampum is red. It speaks of 
   <lb n=2935/>war ! Tell him the red men would have him leave his fort, and march his men from our soil ere to- 
   <lb n=2936/>morrow's sun climbs the sky, or their great chief, who is our prisoner, shall be burned at the stake. 
   <lb n=2937/>Listen ! tell him the red warriors await his answer, in numbers as many as the leaves upon the 
   <lb n=2938/>trees — hasten." 
</p>
<lb n=2939/>
<p>
   <lb n=2940/>The aged chiefs granted an assent ; the dvrarf received the belt and departed. Ere he had pro- 
   <lb n=2941/>ceeded half a mile, a messenger overtook him, with orders from the sapient council to return. The 
   <lb n=2942/>dwaif measured the distance to the council house, and then turned back, and his eyes assumed a 
   <lb n=2943/>diabolical expression, and his eyes rolled with rage. The chiefs still occupied their seats, and ap- 
   <lb n=2944/>peared to take no farther notice of his return than by puffing larger volumes of smoke from their 
   <lb n=2945/>lips. Pontiac fixed his eyes upon the dwarf's countenance, and the gaze appeared to read the in- 
   <lb n=2946/>most thoughts which worked so wildly and energetically in his breast ; his own countenance was 
   <lb n=2947/>as unmoved and expressionless as if he slept. 
</p>
<lb n=2948/>
<p>
   <lb n=2949/>" Will the panther degrade himself and be a fox 1" at length the sachem thundered out. 
</p>
<lb n=2950/>
<p>
   <lb n=2951/>The dwarf laid his hand on his heart, and then throwing out his arms, exclaimed, " If the Ottawa 
   <lb n=2952/>sachem thinks the panther could be a fox, let him treat him as one." 
</p>
<lb n=2953/>

   <lb n=2956/>" Methinks Pishairo is no snake," grumbled another. 
</p>
<lb n=2957/>
<p>
   <lb n=2958/>A writhing smile played upon the sachem's face, as he respectfully nodded to the old men who 
   <lb n=2959/>spoke, and bade the dwarf depart, nor tarry on his way.

<lb n=2964/>
<p>
   <lb n=2965/>By day-break next morning, the warriors of the surrounding tribes poured in from all directions, 
   <lb n=2966/>till the woods were filled with them. The large council house was occupied by the old men, while 
   <lb n=2967/>the young warriors went through their war dance, and excited each other's passions with songs of 
   <lb n=2968/>the white aggressors, and tales of their own chivalrous feats. At the council, the Ottawa sachem 
   <lb n=2969/>exerted his talents with the most skilful success. With a profound knowledge of the character of 
   <lb n=2970/>the members of the several tribes who sat before him, he spoke words which, to them, were as fire ; 
   <lb n=2971/>nothing was left unsaid to arouse their passions against the whites. With oratorical powers, which 
   <lb n=2972/>could not be commanded by a white man, and an energy of gesture, which was natural, he painted 
   <lb n=2973/>in vivid colors to their imaginations, the usurpations of the white race since their arrival on the soil; 
   <lb n=2974/>how they had taken possession of their hunting grounds, and destroyed their game, and finally tried 
   <lb n=2975/>to steal away their children to make them slaves. He appealed to their prejudices and to their pas- 
   <lb n=2976/>sions ; and to render them more sanguine of success, promised them the assistance of the Great 
   <lb n=2977/>Spirit, who, he said, had visited him in a dream, and declared he would assist their cause, which was 
   <lb n=2978/>the holy one of freedom. The old waniors grasped their weapons, and, with suppressed interjections

<lb n=2983/>
<p>
   <lb n=2984/>of rage, shook them in the air. During this excitement a small man entered, and took his way 
   <lb n=2985/>through the rows of warriors, till he stood before the orator. It was Pishairo ; he bore on the point 
   <lb n=2986/>of a long pole the war belt which he had received of Pontiac the previous evening; it was stripped 
   <lb n=2987/>of all its wampum, and was bare ! The sachem snatched it from the pole, and held it before the ex- 
   <lb n=2988/>cited members of the council, while his countenance was distorted with passion. The effect was in- 
   <lb n=2989/>stantaneous; the whole council arose with one burst of rage, and rushed out of the door, followed 
   <lb n=2990/>by Pontiac, who tore the belt to a thousand pieces, as he strode after them. The young warriors 
   <lb n=2991/>deserted the painted pole around which they danced, and with a wild yell crowded forward at the 
   <lb n=2992/>heels of the host which rushed forward with the irresistible impetus of the mountain torrent. They 
   <lb n=2993/>arrived at the wigvi^am where the prisoner lay, which they tore to pieces, and unbinding him, they 
   <lb n=2994/>bore him to the stake amid the deafening yells of the young warriors, while hundreds crowded in 
   <lb n=2995/>with arms full of dry faggots. The white man tried to speak, but his voice wSs drowned amid the 
   <lb n=2996/>loud curses of his enemies, whose fists and spear handles w-ere as busy as their tongues. His clothes 
   <lb n=2997/>were instantly torn from him in rags, and his body was painted black ; a buffalo thong was tied 
   <lb n=2998/>around his neck, and fastened to the stake, leaving a line long enough for him to move freely. The 
   <lb n=2999/>faggots were piled around at the distance of six feet, and a warrior stood with a torch to light them, 
   <lb n=3000/>when a shrill cry was heard, and the daughter of Pontiac sprang over the dry wood, and threw her- 
   <lb n=3001/>self upon the breast of her lover, which she clung to as a drowning man to a straw. The warriors 
   <lb n=3002/>looked upon this sight, which was so suddenly and unexpectedly presented them, with astonish- 
   <lb n=3003/>ment ; but there was no gaze of pity mingled with those looks — no compassion for her distress ; 
   <lb n=3004/>they curled their lips with rage, which soon broke out in yells of impatience. Pontiac drew back a 
   <lb n=3005/>moment with surprise, and then, with the fury of a demon, he grasped his tomahawk, and rushed 
   <lb n=3006/>upon his daughter to dash out her brains, when his arm was caught by Pishairo, the violent and se- 
   <lb n=3007/>cret lover of the maiden. With a thundering exclamation of contempt, the sachem seized the dwarf, 
   <lb n=3008/>as if he had been the smallest infant, and hurled him far over the heads of the warriors. The In- 
   <lb n=3009/>dian sprang upon his feet, and stung with rage, rushed at Pontiac, whom he reached in time to sus- 
   <lb n=3010/>pend a second blow, when a famous chief of another tribe interfered, and saved the life of the 
   <lb n=3011/>maiden. She was torn from the prisoner, and borne back to her wigwam ; the faggots were fired, 
   <lb n=3012/>and the dreadful work commenced. At this moment, a discharge of rifles burst upon the astonished 
   <lb n=3013/>warriors, and many of them were laid low with the dead ; but the rest, v.ho were excited to phren- 
   <lb n=3014/>zy, fought like lions. Before the English could load their guns, the Indians, led by Pontiac, were 
   <lb n=3015/>among them with the dreadful tomaliawk, which they wielded with their usual force and success. 
   <lb n=3016/>The battle was now hand to hand, and each man was engaged in a struggle which was for life or 
   <lb n=3017/>death. During this time, the Indian maiden rushed through the burning faggots and cut the cord 
   <lb n=3018/>which bound her lover, who joined his people, nov/ losing ground beneath the desperation of the In- 
   <lb n=3019/>dians. Long and deadly was the contest, but finally the' whites were forced to give way before the 
   <lb n=3020/>fury of the savages. They retreated with tolerable order, under the example of their naked and 
   <lb n=3021/>blackened commander, who had lost none of his bi avery with his clothes. They regained their boats, 
   <lb n=3022/>and after striving once more to gain an advantage, without success, paddled ofl', followed by the 
   <lb n=3023/>curses of the warriors, whose rage was none appeased b}' being deprived of the consoling sight of a 
   <lb n=3024/>prisoner burnt at the stake. Pontiac mounted a log, and in a few moments succeeded in fanning 
   <lb n=3025/>their already excited passions to a furious flame, and then the whole savage host marched for Fort 
   <lb n=3026/>Duquesne, as the exciting war song, from a thousand voices, swelled upon the air.

</head>
<lb n=3031/>
<p>
   <lb n=3032/>Among the warriors was a Chippewa chief, named Minavana, gifted with a powerful eloquence, 
   <lb n=3033/>which, with an indomitable disposition, rendered him a formidable rival of the Ottawa sachem. The 
   <lb n=3034/>Chippewas were at that time the strongest, with the single exception of the Oltawas, of the tribes 
   <lb n=3035/>inhabiting that vast wilderness stretching between the lakes and the Ohio river. This chief beheld, 
   <lb n=3036/>with a jealous eye, the ascending influence of the Ottawa sachem, whose power he iinagined was on 
   <lb n=3037/>the ebb, and with all the secret intrigue which he possessed, caballed against Pontiac. But these 
   <lb n=3038/>intrigues did not escape the wily sachem's notice, who, by means of some of the Chippewa's own 
   <lb n=3039/>warriors, received daily information of the progress of his plots. 
</p>
<lb n=3040/>
<p>
   <lb n=3041/>The sun was high in the heavens, when the host of warriors reached a ravine, formed by a moun- 
   <lb n=3042/>tain torrent, which, for ages, had rolled down the path. Here they encamped for the night, and af- 
   <lb n=3043/>ter placing sentinels around the neighborhood of the camps, the Ottawa sachein took his spear, and 
   <lb n=3044/>strode up the mountain side. He went alone — there was no human being to whom he could com- 
   <lb n=3045/>municate his secret projects, for there was no red man whose mind appeared to him gigantic enough 
   <lb n=3046/>to share his ambitious schemes. He strode up the mountain, looking upon either side, as he held 
   <lb n=3047/>his spear ready to strike into any of the wild animals, which, at that time, inhabited the mountain- 
   <lb n=3048/>ous countries in great numbers. The sun was now sinking behind a bed of clouds at the far west_ 
   <lb n=3049/>the birds were singing their evening songs ; the wind was lulled to sleep, and even the stern sa'

</p>
<lb n=3054/>
<p>
   <lb n=3055/>chem's breast was influenced by the repose around him ; his fierce spirit was calmed, and as he sat 
   <lb n=3056/>on a high rock, overlooking the whole country, he reasoned dispassionately on the probable chance 
   <lb n=3057/>of his succeeding in his bold design of driving the whites from his country. " Then again," said he, 
   <lb n=3058/>" will I be the sole king of this broad and blooming hunting ground : there will be no white men to 
   <lb n=3059/>teach our warriors cowardice, nor to create dissatisfaction among our young men. All will be as it 
   <lb n=3060/>were in the olden times ere the pale faces visited our shores ; and when the sachem's runners were 
   <lb n=3061/>not treated with contempt." 'J'he sachem's voice sank lower, but he was so absorbed in his ambi- 
   <lb n=3062/>tious thoughts, as not to observe two individuals who stood upon a rock just above him. They 
   <lb n=3063/>gazed eagerly upon him, and then spoke earnebtly, but in a tone sufficiently low as not to reach the 
   <lb n=3064/>ear of the dreaded chief. The smaller warrior, who was the dwarf Pishairo, stealthily disappeared 
   <lb n=3065/>behind the rock ; the other, who was the Chippewa sachem Minavana, made a noise which attracted 
   <lb n=3066/>the attention of Pontiac, and then appeared to be looking in another direction, apparently uncon- 
   <lb n=3067/>scious of his proximity to the Ottawa. 
</p>
<lb n=3068/>
<p>
   <lb n=3069/>" The Chippewa sachem is a panther in the fight," said Pontiac, in a tone of commendation. 
</p>
<lb n=3070/>
<p>
   <lb n=3071/>The Chippewa turned around, and, apparently surprised, saluted the sachem Vv'ith dignity and 
   <lb n=3072/>marked respect. 
</p>
<lb n=3073/>
<p>
   <lb n=3074/>" Would the sapient Pontiac practice his spesr upoii the heart of the bloody panther ere he plants 
   <lb n=3075/>it in the white man's 1" said the Chippewa, with a deferential inclination of the head, as he strode 
   <lb n=3076/>to the rock upon which sat the Ottawa. " I have sought thee eagerly ; the pale face warriors are 
   <lb n=3077/>upon our grounds, and our young warriors pant for battle — they want Pontiac." 
</p>
<lb n=3078/>
<p>
   <lb n=3079/>The Ottawa sprang to his feet, and followed Minavana. They wound their way around huge 
   <lb n=3080/>rocks — now upon the edge of a frowning precipice, where one false step would hurl them to atoms, 
   <lb n=3081/>and then at the bottom, where rocks rose above them, like the towers of some tremendous castle ; 
   <lb n=3082/>but they trod their way with a precision which could not be learned but by one who had spent years 
   <lb n=3083/>among the mountains. They finally reached a deep ravine, half way to the encampment of the In- 
   <lb n=3084/>dian army. The rocks rose high on each side, leaving a space between them of but a few feet. The 
   <lb n=3085/>Ottawa walked some distance before, wholly occupied in anticipating the battle, in which he hoped 
   <lb n=3086/>to be a formidable participator; while walking, he heard a voice, and turning around, the Chippewa 
   <lb n=3087/>chief was no where to be seen ; but in the gloom of the evening, he beheld a party of his warriors, 
   <lb n=3088/>armed alone with knives; they slowly advanced, dispersing, apparently with a view of taking him 
   <lb n=3089/>alive. The Ottawa hurled his spear in the breast of one, and, with his war cry, attacked them witli 
   <lb n=3090/>a fury which was irresistible ; he broke through them, and leaving four of their number dead, bound- 
   <lb n=3091/>ed down the mountain side; a shrill yell before him, by its peculiar tone, informed him a Chippewa 
   <lb n=3092/>was near ; he drew his knife, aud bounded forward — the sachem Minavana stood before him, 
</p>
<lb n=3093/>
<p>
   <lb n=3094/>" Curse thy false heart, Chippewa, thou art a squaw !" and with one jump, they stood facing each 
   <lb n=3095/>other, their eyes gleaming hate, and their lips curled with the scorn with which they pretended to 
   <lb n=3096/>view each other. 
</p>
<lb n=3097/>
<p>
   <lb n=3098/>" Thou art but a little girl, Ottawa, when the Chippewa sachem stands before thee," and with 
   <lb n=3099/>these approbious epithets, they fought with fury. Their physical powers were well matched, but 
   <lb n=3100/>the dread in which the Chippewa held Pontiac, might have weakened his energies, and he appeared 
   <lb n=3101/>to quail beneath the glare of the Ottawa's eye ; but he fought with the desperation which his situ- 
   <lb n=3102/>ation required. They were now locked in each other's firm embrace, and, after writhing awhile, 
   <lb n=3103/>they fell from the rock upon which they fought, upon a ledge a few feet below. They sprung upon 
   <lb n=3104/>their feet, and stood a moment to regain energy for their last struggle. They viewed each other 
   <lb n=3105/>with gestures of scorn. 
</p>
<lb n=3106/>
<p>
   <lb n=3107/>" The Ottawa squaw can't fight — his arms are too weak," panted the Chippewa in a contemp- 
   <lb n=3108/>tuous tone, while he knew he had been worsted in the scuffle. 
</p>
<lb n=3109/>
<p>
   <lb n=3110/>" The Chippewa is a fox, he is unworthy to live among warriors," oiied the other, and with 
   <lb n=3111/>drawn knives they again rushed' at each other ; and the Chippewa, who was the most excited by the 
   <lb n=3112/>other's taunting language, threw himself off his guard, and received the Ottawa's knife, which pene- 
   <lb n=3113/>trated to his heart. Pontiac tore from his head the scalp, and went his way to the camp. The war 
   <lb n=3114/>song rang upon his ear, and the young warriors were dancing around the painted war pole, while 
   <lb n=3115/>the old men had already assembled in the council house, and with impatience awaited the presence 
   <lb n=3116/>of their sachems. Pontiac entered with the reeking scalp of Minavana in his hand ; he took his sta- 
   <lb n=3117/>tion at the head of the council house, and held up before them the scalp, from which yet dropped 
   <lb n=3118/>the warm blood. The house was now full to overflowing ; the young warriors had ceased their 
   <lb n=3119/>dance, and repaired to the council en masse to hear of the next day's operation ; every wigwam was 
   <lb n=3120/>deserted, and all the warriors choked up that spacious yet temporary house, till there was not room 
   <lb n=3121/>for one more spectator. With his usual strength of voice, the Ottawa sachem recounted to the listen- 
   <lb n=3122/>ing multitude the manner in which he had procured the scalp he held before them. In the most 
   <lb n=3123/>glowing colors he depicted to them the struggle he had to save his life, which he declared was va- 
   <lb n=3124/>lueless to himself, but of infinite value to his nation at this critical moment. He shook the scalp in 
   <lb n=3125/>the air, and called upon his people to revenge the attempt upon his life, which he assured them was 
   <lb n=3126/>only the beginning of a long concocted plot to undermine the power of his nation, and build up ano- 
   <lb n=3127/>ther on its ruins. His eloquence ran like lightning tlirough the ranks of warriors, and their various

   <lb n=3139/>passions were shown conspicuously upon their features. The young shook their tomahawks in the 
   <lb n=3140/>air, and with demoniacal gestures, desired to be led against their enemies. 
</p>
<lb n=3141/>
<p>
   <lb n=3142/>At this moment, when all was excitement, the dwarf Pishairo stepped before Pontiac,_and after 
   <lb n=3143/>eyeing him for a moment, came closer to him, as if to impart an important secret. The sachem 
   <lb n=3144/>stooped down in a listening posture; the dwarf suddenly drew a knife and stuck it to the handle in 
   <lb n=3145/>his breast — the blade pierced the heart of Pontiac ! he sank upon the earth and died ; the mighty 
   <lb n=3146/>Pontiac, whose name carried terror even among the whites, expired at the feet of his base slave, the 
   <lb n=3147/>dwarf Pishairo. A loud burst of rage rang from the lips of every warrior present, who rushed up, 
   <lb n=3148/>and seizing the murderer, bore him from the council house ; they no longer thought of their chief, their 
   <lb n=3149/>whole thoughts were completely absorbed with revenge. They carried the traitor into an open space, 
   <lb n=3150/>and by piece-meal, they cut his flesh from his body. The wretch was one hour expiring. Their re- 
   <lb n=3151/>venge satiated, they returned to their fallen sachem, who lay upon the ground dead and stiff". They 
   <lb n=3152/>all silently gathered around, wrapped in profound and solemn thought, for now their rage had passed 
   <lb n=3153/>away. Long did they stand and silently gaze upon the marble features of him, whose frown could 
   <lb n=3154/>have awed so many. At length a chief arose, his hair was as white as the driven snow, and his once 
   <lb n=3155/>powerful frame was bent with years ; his voice trembled with age and emotion as he spoke, and he 
   <lb n=3156/>was listened to with reverential attention. He recanted the bold exploits of the fallen lion who was 
   <lb n=3157/>at their feet, and he dwelt long upon his virtues, which were as many and as bright as the dew-drops 
   <lb n=3158/>upon the leaves. The impression could not be resisted even by the stoical warriors ; the large tear- 
   <lb n=3159/>drops trickled down their cheeks despite their efforts to conceal them, as they looked upon all that 
   <lb n=3160/>remained of Pontiac, the last of the Ottawa sachems. And well might they weep ! for the gigantic 
   <lb n=3161/>mind, which kept their tribe to its pinnacle of power, had departed forever !

<p>
   <lb n=3165/>The daughter of Pontiac wandered about like a restless spirit, till at length she suddenly disap- 
   <lb n=3166/>peared from among them ; and for many moons did the red man search after her, but she was not 
   <lb n=3167/>to be found, and they finally concluded she had followed her father to the " great hunting grounds 
   <lb n=3168/>far away to the rising sun." At length she was discovered — she was the wife of the young com-

<p>
   <lb n=3231/>Come, let us recline awhile beneath the wide-spreading branches of this ancient pine, and steal 
   <lb n=3232/>from the busy hours a few moments for wholesome meditation. Around us are reposing, in the 
   <lb n=3233/>calm tranquillity of dreamless sleep, the friends of our childhood — the beloved of our liper years. A 
   <lb n=3234/>holy melancholy, a subdued sorrow, rests with brooding wings upon this solemn bourne. These 
   <lb n=3235/>pale violets mark the hallowed spot where slumbers the young mother's darling — the proud father's 
   <lb n=3236/>hope. Tears, pure as parental love, have bedewed their opening buds — tears prompted by aflection 
   <lb n=3237/>so deep and true that the pure offering has found acceptance in the sight of Him, and a sweet and 
   <lb n=3238/>tranquil sorrow steals o'er the hearts of the youthful mourners, purifying and preparing them for 
   <lb n=3239/>the solemn change that awaits all mortality. Yon marble column glancing in the sunlight, a sculp- 
   <lb n=3240/>tured wreath encircling its cleft brow, tells us of the deep-springing affection of years by thy hand 
   <lb n=3241/>severed, oh ! death — of kind tones hushed — of the young household desolate — of the prattling cry 
   <lb n=3242/>of laughing infants for their dear mother's voice and smile stilled. The wife, the mother, rests be- 
   <lb n=3243/>neath. Mark that venerable monument, by wind-reft pines and time-worn oaks o'ershadowed ! Let 
   <lb n=3244/>us, with reverential step, approach and gaze upon its solemn face ! No more is heard the voice of 
   <lb n=3245/>admonition, or of calm advice. No more the joyous grand-children climb about grand-pa's knees, 
   <lb n=3246/>and shout with merry hearts at his jokes, or weep with breasts o'ercharged with sympathetic grief, 
   <lb n=3247/>while breathless listening to the old man's legendary tales. No more beside the cheerful hearth is 
   <lb n=3248/>seen that venerable form — that noble brow — those silvered locks. The old man here from his labor 
   <lb n=3249/>rests, and his fond family know him no more. Turn we to this simple slab of modest gray ; no 
   <lb n=3250/>name — no date proclaims who rests beneath. These deep-hewn lines will tell, perhaps, the story 
   <lb n=3251/>of his life.

   <lb n=3273/>love — have these all ceased v/ith the throbbing of thy heart 1 Has the inner life — the ethereal es-

   <lb n=3275/>flower-scented morning whispers " No!" The soothing calm of summer's twilight eve murmurs 
   <lb n=3276/>" No !" The sheeted lightning and the crashing tempest thunder " No !" The insect humming 
   <lb n=3277/>through its happy hour — the shy bird sheltered in some quiet nook — pour forth their voice of love 
   <lb n=3278/>and inward sense of happiness. Think you, there mingles no tiibute of the heart with their har- 
   <lb n=3279/>monious hymnings '! And thou ! man ! whose mortality rests at my feet — thou, alone, had'st no

   <lb n=3281/>worm, if thou did'st feel not the immortal spirit within thee, like the imprisoned bird, beat at the

   <lb n=3307/>midnight hours. Then, when the listening spirit may almost hear the stately music of the revolv- 
   <lb n=3308/>ing spheres, 'tis thus she speaks — " Oh, Present! why, with fleet step and agitated mien, speed'st 
   <lb n=3309/>thou onward to thy bourne ? That which I was, thou art — what I am, thou shalt become. The 
   <lb n=3310/>doom is on thee, and thou can'st not wander from the one path. Why, then, oh why, by the silent 
   <lb n=3311/>■way-side wilt thou not sit down and listen to my voice l Thou can'st not hear it in the city's busy 
   <lb n=3312/>haunts, or in pleasure's lighted halls. And I will tell thee, oh ! Present, that thou art but a shadow — 
   <lb n=3313/>the shadow of the future, as I was of thee. Thou can'st not attain the real or the permanent with 
   <lb n=3314/>all thy strugglings. They appertain unto the Future. Let this solemn truth arrest thy anxious 
   <lb n=3315/>steps ! Cease to seek that which thou can'st not find, and suffer thyself silently to be borne on the 
   <lb n=3316/>calm waters of hope to the bosom of thy destiny. With liberal hand and thankful heart, pluck the 
   <lb n=3317/>sweet-scented flowers around thee springing, and let their fragrance sooth thee to rest. A happy 
   <lb n=3318/>and a contented spirit is the noblest and the fittest offering thou can'st place upon the altar of thy 
   <lb n=3319/>worship. Therefore, be wise, be contented, and thou shalt be happy." C, R. T.

<lb n=3399/>
<lb n=3400/>
<lb n=3401/>
<p>
   <lb n=3402/>The use of the bow is of remote antiquity — its obvious simplicity of construction, as well as the 
   <lb n=3403/>purposes to which it is adapted, having rendered its employment almost universal from the very ear- 
   <lb n=3404/>liest periods of which we have any distinct account. But we do not wish to trouble our readers with 
   <lb n=3405/>a disquisition upon its ancient history. It was originally formed, no doubt, of the rough bough of a 
   <lb n=3406/>tree, but improvements would be almost immediately discovered. The simple branch would speedily 
   <lb n=3407/>be rendered more convenient by a little cutting, so as to make the curve regular on both sides of the 
   <lb n=3408/>centre. Homer tells us how the bow of Pandarus was fashioned — 
</p>
<lb n=3409/>
<p>
   <lb n=3410/>He heard, and madly at the motion pleased, 
   <lb n=3411/>His polished bow with hasty rashness seized. 
   <lb n=3412/>'Twas formed of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil; 
   <lb n=3413/>A mountain goat resigned the shining spoil. 
   <lb n=3414/>Who, pierced long since, beneath his arrows bled ; 
   <lb n=3415/>The stately quarry on the cliff lay dead. 
   <lb n=3416/>And sixteen palms his brows' large honors spread ; 
   <lb n=3417/>The workmen joined and shaped the bended horns, 
   <lb n=3418/>And beaten gold each taper point adorns. 
</p>
<lb n=3419/>
<p>
   <lb n=3420/>Herodotus says that the bows of the Ethiopians were four cubits, or not less than six feet long. 
   <lb n=3421/>The Grecian bow is said to have been of the figure of their own letter sigma. The Scythian bow 
   <lb n=3422/>was somewhat of the same form. The bows used by the Daci were made in a very beautiful curve. 
   <lb n=3423/>It has been supposed that the Romans introduced the bow into Britain, or at least very much im- 
   <lb n=3424/>proved those which they found in use among the natives, and in course of time it became the national 
   <lb n=3425/>weapon of the class of inhabitants called yeomen. 
</p>
<lb n=3426/>
<p>
   <lb n=3427/>But the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes were certainly well acquainted with the use of the bow; a 
   <lb n=3428/>knowledge they derived at an early period from their progenitors. The Scandinavian Scalds, speak- 
   <lb n=3429/>ing in praise of the heroes of their countiy, frequently add to the rest of their acquirements a supe- 
   <lb n=3430/>riority of skill in handling the bow. It does not, however, appear that this skill was extended be- 
   <lb n=3431/>yond the purpose of procuring food, or for pastime, either by the Saxons or by the Danes, in times 
   <lb n=3432/>anterior to the conquest. 
</p>
<lb n=3433/>
<p>
   <lb n=3434/>Representations of the bow occur frequently in the Saxon MSS. The cut annexed, taken from 
   <lb n=3435/>a manuscript of the tenth century found in the Cotton Library, gives the figure of a Saxon bow and 
   <lb n=3436/>arrow. The bow is curiously ornamented, having the head and tail of a serpent carved at the ends ; 
   <lb n=3437/>and was probably such an one as was used by the nobility. In all these old Saxon bows we may 
   <lb n=3438/>observe one thing remarkable, that is, the string not being made fast to the eitremities, but permitted

</p>
<lb n=3460/>
<lb n=3461/>
<lb n=3462/>
<p>
   <lb n=3463/>It is well known that the Normans used the bow as a military weapon; and, under their govern- 
   <lb n=3464/>ment, the practice of archery was not only much improved, but generally diffused throughout the 
   <lb n=3465/>kingdom. 
</p>
<lb n=3466/>
<p>
   <lb n=3467/>In the ages of chivalry the usage of the bow was considered as an essential part of the education 
   <lb n=3468/>of a young man who wished to make a figure in life. The heroes of romance are therefore usually 
   <lb n=3469/>praised for their skill in archery ; and Chaucer, with propriety, says of sir Thopas, " He was a good 
   <lb n=3470/>archere." 
</p>
<lb n=3471/>
<p>
   <lb n=3472/>In the seventeenth century archery was much commended as an exercise becoming a gentleman 
   <lb n=3473/>to practice, and greatly conducivp to health. The ladies also were foud of this amusement. It was 
   <lb n=3474/>usual, when they exercised the bow, for the beasts to be confined by very large enclosures, sur- 
   <lb n=3475/>rounded by the hunters, and driven in succession from the covers to the stands, where the fair sports- 
   <lb n=3476/>women were placed ; so that they might readily shoot at them, without the trouble and fatigue of 
   <lb n=3477/>rousing and pursuing them. It is said of Margaret, the daughter of Henry the Seventh, that when, 
   <lb n=3478/>she was on her way towards Scotland, a hunting party was made for her amusement in Alnwick 
   <lb n=3479/>Park, where she killed a buck with an arrow. It is not specified whether the long-bow or the cross- 
   <lb n=3480/>bow was used by the princess upon this occasion ; we are certain, that the ladies occasionally shot 
   <lb n=3481/>with both, for when queen Elizabeth visited lord Montecute at Cowdrey, in Sussex, on the Monday, 
   <lb n=3482/>"Her highness tooke horse, and rode into the park, at eight o'clock in the morning, where was a 
   <lb n=3483/>delicate bowre prepared, under the which were her highness musicians placed ; and a cross-bow, by 
   <lb n=3484/>a nympth, with a sweet song, was delivered into her hands, to shoote at the deere ; about some thirty 
   <lb n=3485/>in number were put into a paddock, of which number she killed three oi four, and the countess of 
   <lb n=3486/>Kildare one." 
</p>
<lb n=3487/>
<p>
   <lb n=3488/>The foregoing observations refer chiefly to the lo7ig-how, so called, to distinguish it from the 
   <lb n=3489/>arbalisi, or a-oss-bow, which was not only much shorter than the former, but fastened also upon a 
   <lb n=3490/>stock, and discharged by the means of a catch or trigger, which probably gave rise to the lock upon 
   <lb n=3491/>the modern musket. We cannot pretend to determine at what period the cross-bow was first brought 
   <lb n=3492/>into England, but we believe not long before the commencement of the thirteenth century ; at least, 
   <lb n=3493/>we never meet with any representation of such an engine prior to that period. On the continent, 
   <lb n=3494/>where probably it originated, its appearance might be somewhat earlier. Historians assure us, that 
   <lb n=3495/>Richard the First was wounded by an arrow from a bow of this kind, while he was reconnoitering 
   <lb n=3496/>the walls of the castle of Chalezun ; which wound was the occasion of his death. 
</p>
<lb n=3497/>
<p>
   <lb n=3498/>The courage, discipline, strength and skill, displayed by British bowmen, during a period of 
   <lb n=3499/>more than six centuries, are so much a matter of ordinary history that it is hardly necessary to enlarge 
   <lb n=3500/>upon them here. In all the expeditions of which they formed a part, they proved to their adversa- 
   <lb n=3501/>ries a terror and a scourge. Even the bare appearance of a body of English archers in the field, often 
   <lb n=3502/>led to a bloodless victory ; and, as experience had proVed that the best armor was no protection against 
   <lb n=3503/>their arrows, their bold and confident spiiit often led them into very unequal contests. 
</p>
<lb n=3504/>
<p>
   <lb n=3505/>Secured in their position by an ingenious mode of fortification, — the materials for which each 
   <lb n=3506/>archer carried on his person, — the English bowmen laughed to scorn the fiercest charges of the steel- 
   <lb n=3507/>clad chivalry of the middle ages. Of all the European nations, none suffered more severely, or more 
   <lb n=3508/>requently, from the effects of their archery than the French. Like the Italians, when invaded by the 
   <lb n=3509/>Huns, — another nation of formidable bowmen, — they composed a mass, expressly depreciating the 
   <lb n=3510/>calamities it inflicted upon them : — " Ab AngUcorum nos defendejacidls /" — " From the arrows of 
   <lb n=3511/>the English, defend us, O Lord !" 
</p>
<lb n=3512/>
<p>
   <lb n=3513/>The ancient legislators, ever on the watch to encourage and enforce the practice of this art, once 
   <lb n=3514/>the sole guardian of the national independence, passed many judicious laws to prevent its falling into 
   <lb n=3515/>disuse. By these, a fine of one mark was levied on every master of a family who permitted any of 
   <lb n=3516/>his male inmates to be without a bow and three shafts, for the space of a month.* The local autho-

   <lb n=3520/>54 burton's gentleman's magazine. 
</p>
<lb n=3521/>
<p>
   <lb n=3522/>rities were required to superintend the erection of public butts, in the environs of every town and 
   <lb n=3523/>village. Many of their ancient positions are yet known, however different the uses to which the 
   <lb n=3524/>ground where they once stood, is at present applied. 
</p>
<lb n=3525/>
<p>
   <lb n=3526/>The nobility and spiritual persons were, by law, excepted ; but men of every other rank and calling 
   <lb n=3527/>assembled, at these public shooting-grounds, to ply the sturdy yew and gallant gray goose wing. 
   <lb n=3528/>Thither the lordly baron sent his feudal vassals ; thither came the squire, the independent franklyn, 
   <lb n=3529/>the wealthy yeoman, the lude peasant, and the unwashed artizan. All formed one promiscuous 
   <lb n=3530/>multitude, of which the numbers, in populous districts, were so considerable that, after the first season, 
   <lb n=3531/>the grass never grew around these public marks. 
</p>
<lb n=3532/>
<p>
   <lb n=3533/>The sabbaths and other holidays vi'ere appropriated, by the statute, for these exercises of archery. 
   <lb n=3534/>But our British progenitors, enthusiastically attached to their favorite weapon, rendered all penal 
   <lb n=3535/>enactments, for a series of ages, unnecessary. The intervals of labor were all devoted to the shoots 
   <lb n=3536/>ing-giound, and their bows and arrows accompanied them in every excursion. 
</p>
<lb n=3537/>
<p>
   <lb n=3538/>The extreme range of a flight shaft, when discharged from one of their ancient bows, is stated to 
   <lb n=3539/>have been four hundred yards, or nearly one quarter of a mile.-j- At about a fourth of this distance, 
   <lb n=3540/>the war arrow would penetrate any ordinary breast-plate, and slay man or hoise at little short of 
   <lb n=3541/>two-thirds of it. To maintain and promote this strong and vigorous shooting, the statute of the 
   <lb n=3542/>33d of Henry the Eighth forbade any man, above the age of foui-and- twenty, to use the lighter kind 
   <lb n=3543/>of arrows, unless the butts were upwards of two hundred and twenty yards apart. After the pro- 
   <lb n=3544/>mulgation of this law, the strong and dexterous archers frequently increased the distance, of their 
   <lb n=3545/>own accord, to two hundred and forty yards. The practice is alluded to by Shakspeare, who, beyond 
   <lb n=3546/>all question, was not only a bowman, but an accomplished one. A contempt for mediocrity is one 
   <lb n=3547/>of the characteristics of genius. The pursuits of his juvenile days — for we have all read of his moon- 
   <lb n=3548/>light excursions to Charlecot Deer-Park, — the law of the land, which permitted no youth of his age 
   <lb n=3549/>and rank to remain one month without a bow and shafts — are sufficient evidence ; and, if more were 
   <lb n=3550/>wanting, we have it under his own hand. 
</p>
<lb n=3551/>
<p>
   <lb n=3552/>Burke once playfully observed — and the pointed sally is characteristic of that great man — th^t 
   <lb n=3553/>fox-hunting formed nf ui mportant balance of the British constitution. His meaning is sufficiently 
   <lb n=3554/>obvious. The chase, oy bringing the aristocracy into familiar contact with the gentry and middle 
   <lb n=3555/>classes of society, broke down the bar of exclusiveness, and led to a mutual interchange of good 
   <lb n=3556/>offices, socially, and in many instances, poUtically advantageous to each.

   <lb n=3558/>" And surely" — says a very agreeable writer, and one evidently well conversant with the sub- 
   <lb n=3559/>ject — " the praise of these excellent qualities belongs more especially to modern archery. No visi- 
   <lb n=3560/>tant of the splendid bow-meetings which each revolving summer recals into existence, throughout the 
   <lb n=3561/>sylvan glades of this romantic land, ever remained uninfluenced by the joyous hilarity, the delight- 
   <lb n=3562/>ful ease and freedom which light each countenaKce with smiles. There, where men of various ranks, 
   <lb n=3563/>and, grace d Dieu ! women too assemble, to bear away — 
</p>
<lb n=3564/>
<p>
   <lb n=3565/>The arrow with a golden head, 
   <lb n=3566/>A.nd shaft of silver white, — 
</p>
<lb n=3567/>
<p>
   <lb n=3568/>the plumed hat and forest gieen place all upon a temporary equality. Superior adroitness alone con- 
   <lb n=3569/>fers distinction. The possessor of- a ducal coronet, whose ill-aimed shaft flies wide of the mark, cheer- 
   <lb n=3570/>fully yields precedence to the untitled bowman who has placed Ids within its broad circlet of gold. 
   <lb n=3571/>Hail then to the free, frank, and joyous spirits which compose an assemblage of British bowmen ! 
   <lb n=3572/>No doubt but the circumstances under which the arclier pursues his amusement, have considerable 
   <lb n=3573/>influence in producing this happy condition of mind. The balmy breezes of summer, — the charms 
   <lb n=3574/>of picturesque scenery, — the romance with which glorious tradition has invested his pursuits, — and 
   <lb n=3575/>the emulation engendered by the knowledge that most of his competitors boast a skill little inferior 
   <lb n=3576/>to his own, — keep the spirits in a state of agreeable excitement. He cannot be unconscious that he 
   <lb n=3577/>is ' the observed of all observers ;' for every attitude — whether it be the preliminary action of string- 
   <lb n=3578/>ing the bow, or the final one by which an arrow is discharged against a distant mark, — displays un- 
   <lb n=3579/>rivalled manliness and grace. His bow, arrows, belt, bracer and shooting-glove are, for the most part, 
   <lb n=3580/>exact counterparts of those used by England's yeomanry, five centuries ago. Even the attire in 
   <lb n=3581/>which he shoots bears a general resemblance to the costume of the same warlike period. These 
   <lb n=3582/>things never fail to tinge imaginations at all excitable with a strong feeling of enthusiasm; and 
   <lb n=3583/>which the regulations of an archery fete are certainly not calculated to weaken. The contest takes 
   <lb n=3584/>place in the presence, and amidst the plaudits, of assembled hundreds.

   <lb n=3605/>It is to the good sense and discernment of the ' Woodmen of the Forest of Aiden' that we owe, 
   <lb n=3606/>in modern times, the introduction of the bow, as a suitable and healthful recreation for their fair 
   <lb n=3607/>countrywomen ,■ — and it was fortunate that their individual position in society entitled them to dic- 
   <lb n=3608/>tate laws to fashion, under whose powerful auspices the practice of archery by females was intro- 
   <lb n=3609/>duced to the world.

   <lb n=3612/>cruelty requiring no excessive corporeal exertion — offering a combination of the rhost graceful po- 
   <lb n=3613/>sitions appropriate to every other exercise, — and invariably associated with refined and polished so- 
   <lb n=3614/>ciety, archery, from that time, made rapid advances in public estimation. The British fair quickly 
</p>
<lb n=3615/>
<p>
   <lb n=3616/>emancipated themselves from the ancient tyranny of back-bones, embroidery frames, spinnets, harp- 
   <lb n=3617/>sichords, and all the other foolery of their grandmothers.

   <lb n=3624/>connexions. Soon, however, the admissions became less exclusive. The piizes awarded by this so*. 
   <lb n=3625/>ciety have always been distinguished for their splendor and variety. But the Aylesfords, the Mor- 
   <lb n=3626/>daunts, the Adamses, the Molands, and the Bagots, of the last — with the Boultbees, the Parkers, 
   <lb n=3627/>the Gresleys, and the Wises, of the present, age — the fair victors who have won, or still ' win and

   <lb n=3633/>Mrs. Crespigny's public breakfasts were another interesting feature in the annals of female archery. 
   <lb n=3634/>Many a deUghtful morning's lounge did these same breakfasts afford to such of the ' fashionable 
   <lb n=3635/>world' as had the good fortune to obtain cards of invitation. They were the most literal and prac- 
   <lb n=3636/>tical illustrations of the utile dulci that I ever knew. The company shot ' games,' as they are caIIc«J 
   <lb n=3637/>in the technicalities of archery. Eleven was the decisive number ; and the arrows count according 
   <lb n=3638/>to their positions in the target. A shot in the gold circle reckons as nine, — the red, seven, — the 
   <lb n=3639/>inner white, five, — the black, three, — the outer white, one. Fines of half-a-crown were paid by the 
   <lb n=3640/>losers, the amount being appropriated to the support of a Sunday-school. The girls of the charity 
   <lb n=3641/>attended these archery meetings, attired in dresses of grass-green.

<p>
   <lb n=3643/>One hundred yards was the space between the targets. When the gentlemen had shot, they 
   <lb n=3644/>walked, in procession with the ladies, thirty paces forward ; and the latter then discharged their ar- 
   <lb n=3645/>rows, at the unusual distance of seventy yards. Many will agree with me in thinking that these 
   <lb n=3646/>archety breakfasts might be judiciously revived, at the present day."

<p>
   <lb n=3666/>The History of the Navy of the United States of America. By J. Fenimore Cooper. Lea and 
</p>
<lb n=3667/>
<p>
   <lb n=3668/>Blanchard, Philadelphia. 
</p>
<lb n=3669/>
<p>
   <lb n=3670/>In appealing before the public with this History of our Navy, Mr. Cooper has had two serious 
   <lb n=3671/>difficuUies to surmount — one of prejudice, and one of exaggerated anticipation. It cannot be denied 
   <lb n=3672/>that, for many years past, he has been rapidly sinking in the estimation of his countrymen, and in- 
   <lb n=3673/>deed of all right minded persons. Even his firmest friends were becoming ashamed of the univer- 
   <lb n=3674/>sality of his cynicism ; and his enemies, ceasing in a measure from open hostility, have been well 
   <lb n=3675/>content to abide the apparently inevitable self-ruin which his own unconquerable ill temper was so 
   <lb n=3676/>speedily bringing about. A flashy succession of ill-conceived and miserably executed literary pro- 
   <lb n=3677/>ductions, each more silly than its predecessor, and wherein the only thing noticeable was the pee- 
   <lb n=3678/>vishness of the writer, the only thing amusing his self-conceit — had taught the public to suspect even 
   <lb n=3679/>a ladical taint in the intellect, an absolute and irreparable mental leprosy, rendering it a question 
   <lb n=3680/>whether he ever would or could again accoinplish any thing which should be worthy the attention 
   <lb n=3681/>of people not positively rabid. In this state of affairs, it was not ut all wonderful that the announce- 
   <lb n=3682/>ment of a Naval History of the United States, by the author of the attack upon Sir Walter Seott, 
   <lb n=3683/>was received with apathy and general distrust — with a feeling very different indeed from that which 
   <lb n=3684/>would have agitated the whole reading world at a similar announcement during the golden days of 
   <lb n=3685/>the celebrated novelist, and once exceedingly popular man. 
</p>
<lb n=3686/>
<p>
   <lb n=3687/>Among the few, on the other hand, who had better opportunities of penetrating the mystery, and 
   <lb n=3688/>fathoming the extent, of that obstinate disease of the spleen which had so long made the author a 
   <lb n=3689/>burden to himself, and an object of compassion to his friends — among those who knew the disorder 
   <lb n=3690/>not altogether incurable, and who had good reason to rely firmly upon the innate vigor and elastici- 
   <lb n=3691/>ty of the constitution — even among these we have noticed a want of proper consideration in regard 
   <lb n=3692/>to the subject matter of the anticipated work — a misconception of the extent and capacities of the 
   <lb n=3693/>theme — which has operated to the temporary disadvantage of the historian. 
</p>
<lb n=3694/>
<p>
   <lb n=3695/>Mr. Cooper's strength in sea narrative was well known, and justly appreciated ; and in a work 
   <lb n=3696/>on Naval Histoiy, much was expected of a character very similar to that which had afforded its 
   <lb n=3697/>charm to the " Pilot," and rivetted attention in the " Red Rover." This expectation would have 
   <lb n=3698/>been comparatively well founded had the announcement been that of a Naval Biography, Here, an 
   <lb n=3699/>allowable minuteness of detail would have given vigor and vitality to the narration, and the person- 
   <lb n=3700/>al adventures of the several heroes would have been overspread, in the simple discussion of fact 
   <lb n=3701/>with all the warm hues of the most spirit-stirring romance. In no general naval record, however, 
   <lb n=3702/>should we look too confidently for interest, beyond that grave species which is attached to the mere 
   <lb n=3703/>statement of fact. In records of our own marine, especially, we should look for little farther than 
   <lb n=3704/>this. The story of the simple events of our expeiience (for we are a nation of single ships) must 
   <lb n=3705/>always be deficient in that excitement which is derivable from the unity and majesty of the combined 
   <lb n=3706/>operations of fleets. Here then our sea-history labors under disadvantages not experienced by that 
   <lb n=3707/>of Europe. The tales we have to tell, of detached combat after combat, can form, at best, but a series 
   <lb n=3708/>of monotonous episode, where if the mind seeks, as it will, for connexion, this can only be establish- 
   <lb n=3709/>ed by means of a diy and barren mass of documental and statistical detail. 
</p>
<lb n=3710/>
<p>
   <lb n=3711/>Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, (whose importance we have by no means adequately 
   <lb n=3712/>pointed out) Mr. Cooper has succeeded in writing a book which cannot fad to do him lasting honor, 
   <lb n=3713/>not more in a literary point of view, than as affording evidence of the final triumph of his kindlier 
   <lb n=3714/>and more manly feelings over the promptings of Satan and the spleen. The very preface is redolent 
   <lb n=3715/>of a returning good humor — of a recovered modesty — of a resuscitated common sense. Mr. Cooper 
   <lb n=3716/>is evidently Mr. Cooper once again, and as such we most cordially welcome him home to the good 
   <lb n=3717/>XT ill, and to the affections, of his countrymen. That he, in preference to any one, should have writ- 
   <lb n=3718/>ten the Naval History of the United States, is a matter about which there is but little difference of 
   <lb n=3719/>opinion; and we rejoice, from the bottom of our heart, that he has arisen to the good work, from the 
   <lb n=3720/>moral death which has so long enwrapped him, while it is yet a convenient season for the under- 
   <lb n=3721/>taking — ^before the veteran actors in the drama have all passed away from among us — while there is 
   <lb n=3722/>yet many a tongue to tell what the eyeshave seen — many a living witness to the gallant and glorious 
   <lb n=3723/>exploits which have had so much to do in the rendering us, and in the preserving us, a free people.

<p>
   <lb n=3729/>It is not our design, of course, to speak at length of any portion of a History which will speak scr 
   <lb n=3730/>very eloquently for itself. The narrative commences with the first settlement by the English, pro- 
   <lb n=3731/>ceeds with some details respecting the earliest achievements of the rival French and British colonies, 
   <lb n=3732/>connected with a clear and rapid survey of the condition of the maritime powers of Europe, and 
   <lb n=3733/>after discussing, in a masterly manner, every momentous event in the annals of our Navy, terminates 
   <lb n=3734/>•with the contest of 1812. The war of the Revolution is brought to a close about the middle of the 
   <lb n=3735/>first volume, and the more important subsequent occurrences occupy the lemainder of the publication. 
</p>
<lb n=3736/>
<p>
   <lb n=3737/>The work, as a whole, has, wc think, all the great requisites of a proper History — distinctness of 
   <lb n=3738/>narration, rigorous impartiality, an evident anxiety for truth, and a concise philosophical discussion 
   <lb n=3739/>of fact, rather than a shadowy speculation upon motive. Every similar book, as a matter of course, 
   <lb n=3740/>is liable to objection — to cavil — in regard to its detail ; and, in the present case, we have heard oc- 
   <lb n=3741/>casional censures upon which we scarcely think it necessary to comment. Battles, whether by sea 
   <lb n=3742/>or land, (and battles form our staple here) are seldom witnessed by distinct authorities from the same 
   <lb n=3743/>points of observation, and this fact alone is sufficient to account for a thousand immaterial discre- 
   <lb n=3744/>pancies. 
</p>
<lb n=3745/>
<p>
   <lb n=3746/>In legard to style, let us hear Mr. Cooper himself. 
</p>
<lb n=3747/>
<p>
   <lb n=3748/>" Some of the greatest writers of the age have impaired the dignity of their works, by permitting 
   <lb n=3749/>the peculiarities which have embelllslied their lighter labors to lessen the severity of manner that 
   <lb n=3750/>more properly distinguishes narratives of truth. This danger has been foreseen in the present in- 
   <lb n=3751/>stance, though the nature of the subject, which seldom rises to the level of general history, affords a 
   <lb n=3752/>constant temptation to offend. A middle course has been adopted, which, it is hoped, while some 
   <lb n=3753/>defects of execution may probably be detected, will be found on the whole to be suited to a recital of 
   <lb n=3754/>facts, in the familiar form that, in a measure, the incidents have demanded." 
</p>
<lb n=3755/>
<p>
   <lb n=3756/>The mere English of our author was never, at any period, remarkable for precision of arrange- 
   <lb n=3757/>ment, and however easily, in a work of pure romance, such defect may be disregarded, we must own 
   <lb n=3758/>that it derogates very materially from the beauty of an otherwise excellent historic style. In the 
   <lb n=3759/>volumes before us sentences occur, by far too frequently, where positive ambiguity arises from sheer 
   <lb n=3760/>negligence in regard to the ordinary proprieties of grammar. 
</p>
<lb n=3761/>
<p>
   <lb n=3762/>" Republicanism itself is brought into disrepute, in denying the just rewards of long services to 
   <lb n=3763/>officers, by attaching to it the weakness of a neglect of incentives, an ignorance on the subject of the 
   <lb n=3764/>general laws of discipline, and the odium of injustice. It is by forgetting the latter quality, more 
   <lb n=3765/>through the indifference of a divided power, than from any other cause, that republics have obtained 
   <lb n=3766/>their established character of being ungrateful." 
</p>
<lb n=3767/>
<p>
   <lb n=3768/>Here is great confusion of expression. By '' the latter quality" justice is intended, while 2??jus- 
   <lb n=3769/>tice is implied. 
</p>
<lb n=3770/>
<p>
   <lb n=3771/>" A territorial aristocracy, promotion, in both the army andthenav}', is the inevitable fruit of favor, 
   <lb n=3772/>or of personal rank." 
</p>
<lb n=3773/>
<p>
   <lb n=3774/>This sentence, as it stands, is utterly unintelligible, and can only be comprehended at all by placing 
   <lb n=3775/>before it the words immediately antecedent — which are " The nature of the English government is 
   <lb n=3776/>no secret." It now appears that the English government is " a territorial aristocracy." But every 
   <lb n=3777/>properly constructed sentence should have within itself the means of its own (grammatical) compre- 
   <lb n=3778/>hension. 
</p>
<lb n=3779/>
<p>
   <lb n=3780/>" The man who, refusing to adopt remedies that he believes unsuited to his constitution, is dis- 
   <lb n=3781/>creet, when he carries his system so far as to forget to look for others to supply their places, becomes 
   <lb n=3782/>careless and culpable." 
</p>
<lb n=3783/>
<p>
   <lb n=3784/>This exceedingly ambiguous proposition is rendered perfectly plain by merely a different arrange 
   <lb n=3785/>ment of the same words. 
</p>
<lb n=3786/>
<p>
   <lb n=3787/>" The man who is discreet in refusing to adopt remedies that he believes unsuited to his constitu- 
   <lb n=3788/>tion, becomes careless and culpable when he carries his system so far as to forget to look for others 
   <lb n=3789/>to supply their places." But upon this topic quite enough has been said. 
</p>
<lb n=3790/>
<p>
   <lb n=3791/>Mr. Cooper's observations on the subject of our general marine policy are, v/e think, among the 
   <lb n=3792/>very best portions of his book. They are strikingly comprehensive in view, and evince a profound 
   <lb n=3793/>knowledge of the true incentives of human action. Our limits will permit us to give but a small por- 
   <lb n=3794/>tion of his remarks. 
</p>
<lb n=3795/>
<p>
   <lb n=3796/>"A careful review of these facts and principles must satisfy all who study the subject, that the 
   <lb n=3797/>United States of America have never resorted to the means necessary to dovelope, or even in a limit- 
   <lb n=3798/>ed sense, to employ their own naval resources. As a consequence, they have never yet enjoyed the 
   <lb n=3799/>advai^tage of possessing a powerful marine in time of war, or have felt its influence in sustaining 
   <lb n=3800/>their negotiations, and in supporting their national rights in a time of peace. As yet the ships of 
   <lb n=3801/>America have done little more than show the world what the republic might do with its energies duly 
   <lb n=3802/>directed, and its resources properly developed, by demonstrating the national aptitude for this species 
   <lb n=3803/>of warfare. 
</p>
<lb n=3804/>
<p>
   <lb n=3805/>" But the probationary period of the American marine is passing away, and the body of the peo- 
   <lb n=3806/>ple are beginning to look forward to the appearance of their fleets on the ocean. It is no longer 
   <lb n=3807/>thought there is an unfitness in the republic's possessing heavy ships ; and the opinion of the country 
</p>
<lb n=3808/>
<lb n=3809/>
<lb n=3810/>
<p>
   <lb n=3811/>in this, as in other respects, is slowly rising to the level of its wants. Still many lingering prejudices 
   <lb n=3812/>remain in the public mind, in connexion with this all important subject, and some that threaten the 
   <lb n=3813/>service with serious injury. Of these, the most prominent are, the mode in which the active vessels 
   <lb n=3814/>are employed ; a neglect of the means of creating seamen for the public service ; the fact that there 
   <lb n=3815/>is no force in commission on the Ameiican coast; the substitution of money for pride and self-respectj 
   <lb n=3816/>^s the aim of military men ; and the impairing of discipline, and lessening the deference for the jusr 
   <lb n=3817/>tice of the state, by the denial of rank. 
</p>
<lb n=3818/>
<p>
   <lb n=3819/>" Undei the present system of employing the public vessels, none of the peculiar experience that 
   <lb n=3820/>belongs to the higher objects of the profession is obtained. While ships may be likened to regiments 
   <lb n=3821/>as regards the necessity of manoeuvring together, there is one important feature in which they are 
   <lb n=3822/>totally dissimilar. It may be pretty safely thought that one disciplined regiment will march as far, 
   <lb n=3823/>«adure as much, and occupy its station as certainly as another, but no such calculation can be made 
   <lb n=3824/>■an ships. The latter are machines, and their qualities may be improved by human ingenuity, when 
   <lb n=3825/>their imperfections have been ascertained by experiment. Intelhgent comparisons are the first step

   <lb n=3828/>*' It will be clear to the dullest mind, that the evolutions of a fleet, and, in a greater or less degree. 
   <lb n=3829/>Its success, must be dependent on the qualities of its poorest vessels ; since its best cannot abandon 
   <lb n=3830/>their less fortunate consorts to the enemy. The naval history of the world abounds with instances^ 
   <lb n=3831/>in which the efforts of the first sea-captains have been frustrated by the defects of a portion of the 
   <lb n=3832/>ships under their command. To keep a number of vessels in compact order, to cause them to prer 
   <lb n=3833/>serve their weatherly position in gales and adverse winds, and to bring them all as near as possible 
   <lb n=3834/>up to the standard that shall be formed by the most judicious and careful commander, is one of the 
   <lb n=3835/>iiighest aims of naval experience. On the success of such eflorts depend the results of naval evolu- 
   <lb n=3836/>tions more frequently than on any dexterity in fighting guns. An efficient fleet can no more be 
   <lb n=3837/>formed without practice in squadrons, than an efficient army without evolutions in brigades. By not 
   <lb n=3838/>keeping ships in squadrons, there will also be less emulation, and consequently less improvement. 
</p>
<lb n=3839/>
<p>
   <lb n=3840/>" Under the present system three principal stations aie maintained ; two in the Atlantic, and one 
   <lb n=3841/>in the Mediterranean. On neither of these stations would the presence of a vessel larger than a sloop 
   <lb n=3842/>of war be necessary, on ordinary occasions, provided a force of heavy ships could periodically and un- 
   <lb n=3843/>expectedly appear on all. It is seldom that a single ship of the line is required on any sei-vice; and 
   <lb n=3844/>it is ceitain that a solitary two-decked vessel could have no great influence on those important in- 
   <lb n=3845/>terests which it is the practice of the rest of Christendom to refer to the agency of fleets. By putting 
   <lb n=3846/>in commission six or eight two-decked ships, and by causing them to appear, from time to time, on 
   <lb n=3847/>all the more important stations this side of the two great southern capes, the country, at no material 
   <lb n=3848/>additional cost, would obtain the several objects of practice in fleets, of comparative trials of the 
   <lb n=3849/>qualities of the most important class of vessels in the navy, of a higher state of discipline, and of a 
   <lb n=3850/>vast improvement in the habits of subordination on the part of commanders, a defect that all expe* 
   <lb n=3851/>rience shows is peculiar to the desultory mode of service now in use, and which has produced more 
   <lb n=3852/>naval disasters in the world than probably any other one cause. In a word, the principal ends of a 
   <lb n=3853/>siavy can no more be obtained, by the services of single ships, than wars can be decided by armies 
   <lb n=3854/>cut up into battalions."

   <lb n=3861/>A brilliant and bold production, bearing the impress of the mind of its author. With the tenets, 
   <lb n=3862/>liowever, here so well supported by Mr.Dimitry we will not altogether coincide. They border sMueT 
   <lb n=3863/>what too closely, in our apprehension, upon the eloquent madness of Turgot, Price, Priestly, Con', 
   <lb n=3864/>dorcet, and De Stael — yet, strange to say, none of these names occur in the Lecture with the excep- 
   <lb n=3865/>tion perhaps, of that of Priestly, in an incidental manner! There can be no doubt, however, at what 
   <lb n=3866/>sparkling fountains our author has imbibed his scarcely tenable notions of the perfectibility of man. 
   <lb n=3867/>For to this end, more than to any other, tend the doctrines and the arguments of the essay. In thfl 
   <lb n=3868/>position itself we have little faith, but great faith in the ability of our fiiend to make the best of a bad 
   <lb n=3869/>topic. This, in the present instance, he has undoubtedly accomplished, as the spirited passage aa- 
   <lb n=3870/>iiexed will testify more fully than any assertion of our own.

<lb n=3871/>
<p>
   <lb n=3872/>" The highest degree of perfection to which man is, by nature, destined, grows out of the free an4 
   <lb n=3873/>complete development of his individuality, under the influences of beauty, goodness, and truth, aruj 
   <lb n=3874/>of his close and brotherly union with his fellow-laborers on earth. The principle of human perfeo» 
   <lb n=3875/>tibility will, therefore, when fully developed, induce a state in which mind and matter, reconciled to 
   <lb n=3876/>each other, will produce a lofty and splendid harmony; in which each special order of mind will find 
   <lb n=3877/>a corresponding object, and a proper sphere of action and usefulness ; in which man, instead of wast, 
   <lb n=3878/>ing his powers in fruitless strifes, will exert them in subjugating material nature; in which the iHr

<lb n=3894/>
<p>
   <lb n=3895/>Such is the society which awaits the futurity of the world. Under what combination of circum- 
   <lb n=3896/>stance and time it shall be fashioned, cannot be ascertained. But history unerringly points to it — 
   <lb n=3897/>reason sanctions it ; while, at the same time, it teaches that it shall be given to man to compass its 
   <lb n=3898/>attainment ; for reason embodies certain invariable principles which, when once asserted and grasped 
   <lb n=3899/>by the people, ai'e used by them as a resting point for farther and extended operations. In regard to 
   <lb n=3900/>the principles themselves, their progress will no longer consist in variation, innovation, or change j 
   <lb n=3901/>but their immutability shall be the basis of all improvement, which, out of this condition, would be 
   <lb n=3902/>liable to the same oscillations and doubts, m the midst of which man has hitherto all but fruitlessly 
   <lb n=3903/>consumed his powers and his strength. Now, those principles will obtain so soon as natural law — 
   <lb n=3904/>I mean the law deduced from human reason, as a criterion of truth — the law inherent to our sociable 
   <lb n=3905/>nature, and harmonising with humanity in all places and time ; so soon as that law, in accordance 
   <lb n=3906/>with the moral law of Christiarrity, shall have every where supplanted the conventional law, which 
   <lb n=3907/>is not based, however we may try to conceal it, upon the general constitution of human nature, but 
   <lb n=3908/>upon the partial interests of individuals, corporations, cities, provinces, and States — upon the neces- 
   <lb n=3909/>sity of circumstances and the will of the lawmaker. 
</p>
<lb n=3910/>
<p>
   <lb n=3911/>That such a society may bs realized in a given time we are bound to believe with as much cer- 
   <lb n=3912/>tainty as we believe that we are gifted with the exercise of reason. We must, otherwise, surrender 
   <lb n=3913/>to the harrowing conviction that our appearance here is but an aimless and fantastic farce ; that some 
   <lb n=3914/>evil genius, after having engraved in our nature an instinct of that which is impossible, mocks at out 
   <lb n=3915/>insatiable appetences and our panting efforts round a charmed circle, in which we ever return to the 
   <lb n=3916/>starting point ; that, after all, the tradition of Tantalus is no fable ; and that this world is but a vast 
   <lb n=3917/>gehenna, irr which perpetual torture and perpetual disappointment are the inevitable lot of man. But 
   <lb n=3918/>how can we withhold our faith from a doctrine co-extensive with the mind, and brilliant as hope 
   <lb n=3919/>itself? A doctrine for which the Savior suffered on earth ; and which martyrs and sages have vin- 
   <lb n=3920/>dicated with their blood and their lives, offered up in testimony of its truth 1 Many may view these 
   <lb n=3921/>monitions of history as phantasms of the brain ; oi brand rational inductions as Utopian dreams. Let 
   <lb n=3922/>them ! When the first troglodyte issued from his cavern into the social world, and returned to his 
   <lb n=3923/>fellow-intelligent brutes with the story of civilization abroad, they met his words with derision and 
   <lb n=3924/>scorn ! They, bound in the darkness of their caves and the filth of their clay hovels, could not realize 
   <lb n=3925/>the splendors of the palace and the comforts of its life. They too — had the supercilious word, in- 
   <lb n=3926/>vent€d by their imitators, been known — they, too, would have exclaimed, Utopia! They, whose 
   <lb n=3927/>inch-deep intellect, or whose all-controlling prejudices, stop at the surface of things, and, viewing the 
   <lb n=3928/>evils only which still afflict society, pronoimce the notiotr of perfectibility to be chimerical and vain, 
   <lb n=3929/>they do not intelligently attend to the sober teachings of reason and truth. Marr, as a sensual being, 
   <lb n=3930/>belongs to the world of the senses ; and that is an habitual state of war between his physical powers'— 
   <lb n=3931/>a bellum omnium contra omnes — a war of all against all. But, again, man, as a rational being, also 
   <lb n=3932/>belongs to the world of mind ; and, as such, he is destined, by the law of his spiritual nature, to subf 
   <lb n=3933/>due the material world. The complement of that law will be to defeat the belligerance of material 
   <lb n=3934/>forces; and, at some providential period, to assert the full and definite triumph of reason, and the 
   <lb n=3935/>consequent prevalence of happiness and peace. Individuals now enjoy that triumph of reason and 
   <lb n=3936/>blessing of peace. Why should they not extend to the collective being called society 1 To argue 
   <lb n=3937/>that it cannot, is to argue that there is no essential law that will equally apply to man in. his indi- 
   <lb n=3938/>vidual and social capacity : it is to advance an unnatural, an anti-social, and a degrading paradox : 
   <lb n=3939/>it is to strike at the vitality of virtue, through the freedom of man's will, and madly to insult the 
   <lb n=3940/>superhuman wisdom of Him who made man the proxy of his power!"

<p>
   <lb n=3947/>The " Letters on Paraguay" were exceedingly well received by the reading puDlic, and this is a

   <lb n=3950/>existed ; that it was an inland region of South America ; that it had been the seat of the Jeauite.

   <lb n=3967/>Isabel; or Sicily. A Pilgrimage, By Henry T, Tuckerman. Lea and Blanchard, Phila- 
   <lb n=3968/>delphia. 
</p>
<lb n=3969/>
<p>
   <lb n=3970/>Mr. Tuckerman is known as the author of the "Italian Sketch Book," and of many very readable 
   <lb n=3971/>articles in the magazines and annuals. Without much of profundity, of originality, or vigor, he is 
   <lb n=3972/>more than usually pure in style, and orthodox in sentiment. The present work will, we think, greatly 
   <lb n=3973/>enhance his reputation as a graceful and agreeable writer. The general plan has apparently been 
   <lb n=3974/>suggested by that of Bulwer's Pilgrims of the Rhine — although here the similarity ceases. 
   <lb n=3975/>Frederick Otley, an American gentleman, travels in Europe with the view of alleviating his grief 
   <lb n=3976/>for the loss of a beloved wife, leaving in his southern home a daughter, in charge of her uncle, his 
   <lb n=3977/>brother. The absence of the traveller is long continued, and the daughter, having grown to wo- 
   <lb n=3978/>manhood, forms the design of surprising him by a visit in Sicily, of which countiy Otley, in his last 
   <lb n=3979/>letter, expressed an intention of making the tour. The uncle accompanies her on the voyage, and the 
   <lb n=3980/>volume concludes with the re-union of the family. The main, indeed the whole design, is to pre- 
   <lb n=3981/>sent the reader with a picturesque account of Sicily, and with the author's own reflections during a 
   <lb n=3982/>tour in that comparatively little travelled portion of the old world. The chain of fiction above men- 
   <lb n=3983/>tioned, (which appears to us somewhat supererogatory) is given, says Mr. T., for the purpose of 
   <lb n=3984/>avoiding that egotistical tone from which it is dithcult to escape in a formal journal, as well as to 
   <lb n=3985/>obviate the necessity of dwelling upon those unimportant details and circumstances which aie com- 
   <lb n=3986/>mon to every tour m Europe, and therefore too familiar to be interesting. There is an air of quiet 
   <lb n=3987/>enthusiasm pervading the whole of tliis little book, which, insensibly, has its influence upon the 
   <lb n=3988/>mind of the reader — disposing him to think well of Mr. Tuckerman as a man, not less than to be 
   <lb n=3989/>pleased with him as an author. There is much in his character, as we gather it from " Isabel," of 
   <lb n=3990/>the warmest poetical impulse — of a perfectly unaffected romance.

<lb n=3996/>
<p>
   <lb n=3997/>In general we dislike such title-pages as this. There is a misty atmosphere of humbug all about 
   <lb n=3998/>them, through which we peer with a suspicious eye. Time was when the duties of an editor were 
   <lb n=3999/>matter of perfect simplicity — at least so far as concerned the public comprehension of these duties; 
   <lb n=4000/>but " we have changed all that" as the world grows older, and in every such announcement as we 
   <lb n=4001/>find here, there always \\es perdu a very pretty little enigma. 
</p>
<lb n=4002/>
<p>
   <lb n=4003/>In its solution there are several points to be considered. Sometimes, as in the case of those su- 
   <lb n=4004/>perb passionate tales the "Recollections of a Chaperon," the work will be written, as well as edited, 
   <lb n=4005/>by a Lady Dacre. Here there is an affectation of modesty — yet the affectation is not altogether un- 
   <lb n=4006/>graceful. Of all the modern editorship this is, beyond doubt, the species least objectionable. 
</p>
<lb n=4007/>
<p>
   <lb n=4008/>The editorship protective is cf a different class. Here, as in the case of Mr. Willis, (whose fine 
   <lb n=4009/>taste should have taught him more intelligible things,) the author makes a somewhat droll bow to a 
   <lb n=4010/>foreign audience, holding fast (God only knows why) to the arm of a Barry Cornwall. However, 
   <lb n=4011/>there is no harm in the world done, and the worst that can happen is a good hearty laugh on the 
   <lb n=4012/>part of the public. 
</p>
<lb n=4013/>
<p>
   <lb n=4014/>But there is a third order of this editorial humbuggery which is positively no joke, and which 
   <lb n=4015/>should never be regarded as such by any decent individual. An example is found in the case of the 
   <lb n=4016/>London publisher, Bentley, who had the downright impudence to get up, some time ago, a reprint 
   <lb n=4017/>of our own admirable " Nick of the Woods," and announce it (no doubt to the great edification of 
   <lb n=4018/>Dr. Bird,) as under the editorial supervision of Mr. Benjamin D'Israeli. 
</p>
<lb n=4019/>
<p>
   <lb n=4020/>In the present instance Mr. James evinces, we think, a sort of half consciousness of being engaged 
   <lb n=4021/>in a rather silly affair. The whole preface has the countenance oiun mouton qui reve. " To day," 
   <lb n=4022/>he says, with the air of an injured man, " it is necessary for an editor to state what he really has 
   <lb n=4023/>done for the work he edits, lest any false impression should be adopted by the pubhc." Having 
   <lb n=4024/>premised thus much, he goes on to show very clearly that in the case now in question he has done — 
   <lb n=4025/>piecisely nothing at all. We could not wish a better commentary upon the whole editorial system.

<lb n=4040/>
<p>
   <lb n=4041/>Taking up tliis volume with a strong feeling of prejudice, induced by a certain ad captandum 
   <lb n=4042/>air in the title, our attention was ri incited by the very initial sentences, and before getting through 
   <lb n=4043/>with the second page we acknowledged the hand of a master. The book is replete with a wordly 
   <lb n=4044/>wisdom even profound ; it is the product of a vigorous and cultivated mind, imbued with a thorough 
   <lb n=4045/>knowledge of its subject, and discussing it con amore. 
</p>
<lb n=4046/>
<p>
   <lb n=4047/>The leading truths here inculcated, are, we think, the more important, because, being through 
   <lb n=4048/>their very nature confined to superficialities, or apparently so confined, the world at large is easily 
   <lb n=4049/>disposed to fall in with those frequent opinions of the grave and learned which declare them inessen- 
   <lb n=4050/>tial. But in this case we challenge the judgment of the tribunal, and will not abide by any decision 
   <lb n=4051/>which shall be " grave and learned." Pour savoir ce qu'il est (^DieuJ ilfaut etre Dieu meme, says 
   <lb n=4052/>the Baron de Bielfeld, in speaking of a more august subject ; but the spirit of his remark is abund- 
   <lb n=4053/>antly applicable to the present matter in hand. To form any just estimate of the importance of 
   <lb n=4054/>habitual intercourse with our fellows, and, more especially, of an attentive regard to the modelling 
   <lb n=4055/>and polishing of our social habits, we must already be men of the world — we must have felt all the 
   <lb n=4056/>miseries of a niauvaise honte, and have revelled in all the luxury of a disenthralment from its bonds. 
</p>
<lb n=4057/>
<p>
   <lb n=4058/>Upon the evils of an absolutely unsocial eKistence it is folly to comment. He who has, at any 
   <lb n=4059/>period, entered with heart into the proper spirit of a high society, will find even a temporary with- 
   <lb n=4060/>drawal from its usages (urged, let us say, by necessity, or induced by disgust, or sought for the se- 
   <lb n=4061/>verer purposes of study) followed by very serious inconveniences, often by poignant mortifications, 
   <lb n=4062/>always by a thorough conviction of man's unfitness for such existence, and of its enervating and de- 
   <lb n=4063/>basing influence upon his intellectual powers, if not upon the whole organization of his moral being. 
   <lb n=4064/>Collecting and concentrating in his retirement an imaginary strength, the solitary student makes at 
   <lb n=4065/>length, for some long designed effort, a step into the world of busy life — but this step is feebly and 
   <lb n=4066/>irresolutely advanced. A farther progress fully awakens him to his weakness and his folly. The 
   <lb n=4067/>volition is in abeyance, which should vivify his forces, and impart to them decision. He now feels 
   <lb n=4068/>and perhaps acknovvledges his error. 
</p>
<lb n=4069/>
<p>
   <lb n=4070/>We could name no book whatever, in which are better exemplified the truth of opinions such as 
   <lb n=4071/>these than in the unpretending volume now before us. In almost every respect it is a valuable and 
   <lb n=4072/>exceedingly well written treatise. Among the detailed precepts which form its body there is, per- 
   <lb n=4073/>haps, little to be found which the letters of Lord Chesterfield have not already given. But without 
   <lb n=4074/>the oflTensive heartlessness of those very objectionable writings, this American work equals them, at 
   <lb n=4075/>least, in all their reputable poists — in vigor of thought and diction, in acumen, in practicability, and 
   <lb n=4076/>in eyideiaces of wordly knowledge.

   <lb n=4089/>drawing that public attention to the science in this country which is now so obviously manifested. 
   <lb n=4090/>We hope that his success with the present publication will be commensurate with the wider range 
   <lb n=4091/>which he has taken. It cannot be denied that a synopsis such as he now puts forth has been long 
   <lb n=4092/>a desideratum. While there has been no deficiency of school books in any one of the sciences em- 
   <lb n=4093/>braced within a proper course of Natural History, it must still have occurred to many as singular, 
   <lb n=4094/>that in a study whose very existence may be said to depend upon method, there should have been, 
   <lb n=4095/>hitherto, no attempt at collecting the parts into an easily discernible whole.

   <lb n=4097/>As the work of Mr. Wyatt professes to be simply a translation of the well known Tableaux of 
   <lb n=4098/>M. Lemmonnier, we need say little more in the way of recommendation than that all the useful 
   <lb n=4099/>spirit of the original has been preserved — and this we say from personal knowledge, and the closest

   <lb n=4106/>ing the purposes of our x\merican schools, some little latitude was of course admissible and unavoid- 
   <lb n=4107/>able. The book is a large octavo, beautifully printed on fine paper, and illustrated by forty-nine well 
   <lb n=4108/>executed plates. Copies, colored with accuracy, under the superintendence of Mr. James Ackermann, 
   <lb n=4109/>are for sale at our principal bookstores. The whole work does credit to all parties, and should be 
   <lb n=4110/>patronized, not less for its intrinsic value than as a matter of just poUcy, by all Philadelphians who 
   <lb n=4111/>have the publishing interest of the city at heart.

<p>
   <lb n=4119/>This is an exceedingly interesting work, and should be in the hands of every one who reads at 
   <lb n=4120/>all. The first volume is made up of the mtroductions to the different speeches of Lord Brougham, 
   <lb n=4121/>which were intended to elucidate the history of certain measures discussed, and, incidentally, of the 
   <lb n=4122/>periods to which they related. The aim is, to give a pictui'e of the times, in an account of the per- 
   <lb n=4123/>sons who bore the chief part in their transactions, in the supposition that the course of state affairs^ 
   <lb n=4124/>their posture at any given period, and the nature of the different measures propounded from time to 
   <lb n=4125/>time, can only be well understood by giving an accurate representation of the characters of those 
   <lb n=4126/>who figured most remarkably upon the stage. This portion of the book embraces a world of detail 
   <lb n=4127/>concerning Cobbett, Stephen, Perceval, Roscoe, Lord Castlereagh, Homer, Wilberforce, Bentham, 
   <lb n=4128/>Sir James Mackintosh, Canning, Huskisson, Grattan, and others. 
</p>
<lb n=4129/>
<p>
   <lb n=4130/>The second volume is occupied with Lord Brougham's inaugural discourse on being installed 
   <lb n=4131/>Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow ; practical obsei-vations upon the education of the people ; 
   <lb n=4132/>and a dissertation on the eloquence of the Ancients ; with an appendix of translations from De- 
   <lb n=4133/>mosthenes. In the matters here contained. Lord Brougham fully sustains his reputation for sound 
   <lb n=4134/>scholarship, as well as profound and luminous criticism. The whole work is imbued with the racy 
   <lb n=4135/>spirit of the author's own intellect — an intellect essentially Demosthenic in the almost rude strength, 
   <lb n=4136/>directness, and impetuosity of its operations. We cannot too pointedly press this excellent publi- 
   <lb n=4137/>cation upon the attention of our readers. The following passage is from a paper on marriage, di- 
   <lb n=4138/>vorce, and legitimacy.

   <lb n=4140/>" To illusti-ate by example his (Sir Wdliam Scott's) singularly refined and pungent wit in con- 
   <lb n=4141/>versation, or the happy and unexpected quotations with which he embellished it, or the tersely told 
   <lb n=4142/>anecdotes with which he enlivened it, without for an instant fatiguing his audience, would be diffi- 
   <lb n=4143/>cult — ^because it is of the nature of the refined essence in which the spirit of the best society con- 
   <lb n=4144/>sists, not to keep. When some sudden, and somewhat violent changes of opinion were imputed to

   <lb n=4148/>was Sir William Scott's remark. A celebrated physician having said, somewhat more flippantly 
   <lb n=4149/>than beseemed the gravity of his cloth, " Oh, you know. Sir William, after forty a man is always 
   <lb n=4150/>either a fool or a physician!" " May'nt he be both. Doctor 1" was the arch rejoinder, with a most 
   <lb n=4151/>aich leer, and insinuating voice, half drawled out. " A vicar was once," (said his lordship,* presi- 
   <lb n=4152/>ding at the dirmer of the Admiralty sessions) " so wearied out with his parish clerk confining himself 
   <lb n=4153/>entirely to the 100th psalm, that he remonstrated, and insisted upon a variety, which the man pro- 
   <lb n=4154/>mised ; but old habit proving too strong for him, the old words were as usual given out next Sun- 
   <lb n=4155/>day, ' All people that on earth do dwell.' Upon this the vicar's temper could hold out no longer, 
   <lb n=4156/>and, jutting his head over the desk, he cried, ' Damn all people that on earth do dwell !' — a very 
   <lb n=4157/>compendious form of anathema," added the learned chief of the spiritual court."

<lb n=4158/>
<p>
   <lb n=4159/>* Sir W. Scott was, durmg the latter years of his life, created a peer, by the title of Lord Stow- 
   <lb n=4160/>ell ; but it is by his former name that he is known to the profession, and to the world.
