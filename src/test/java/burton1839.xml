BURTON'S 



GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE. 



EDITED B X 



WILLIAM E. BURTON AND EDGAR A. POE. 



VOLUME y 



FROM JULY TO DECEMBER. 




By a gentleman, we mean not to draw a line that would be invidious between high and low, rank and subordina- 
tion, riches anil poverty. No. The distinction is in the mind. Whoever is open, just, and true ; whoever is of a 
humane and affable demeanor; whoever is honorable in himself, and in his judgment of others, and requires no 
law but his word to make him fulfil an engagement ;— such a man is a f;entleman ;— and such a man may De found 
among the tillers of the earth as well as in the drawing rooms of the high born and the rich.

THE ELIZABETHAN STAGE 



•WITH AK BH"G HAVING OK STIEX, BESIEKED BTBDSS, KEPHBSBSTIira 



THE PERFORMANCE 



Of Shalispeare'' s Comedy of Love's Lahor's Lost before Qmai Elizabeth. 



The subject of the accompanying plate is a fancy sketch by a celebrated English artist, named 
Buss, representing the performance of Shakspeare's comedy of Love's Labor's Lost, before queen 
Elizabeth and her Court. We believe, from the London papers, that the painter intended to repre- 
sent Shakspeare upon the stage before his august patron, in the performance of Don Adriano de Ar- 
mado, a fantastical Spaniard, a character in the above comedy. But we have no authority that the 
dramatist ever performed in the play in question, although we do not possess the power of contra- 
dicting the assertion. The nation and nature of the character, and the quaint allusion contained in 
its name, were undoubtedly designed as a grateful compliment to her virgin majesty. Shakspeare 
was indubitably a courtier, and spared no means of gratifying the weaknesses of Elizabeth and the 
prejudices of the day. The vilifying twisting of the character of Richard IIL, the mortal enemy of 
the giandfather of the queen, is a convincing evidence in support of our assertion. 

The play of Love's Labor's Lost (so named in the folio of 1623,) is generally supposed to be the 
earliest of Shakspeare's productions. Malone assigns 1591 as the date of the original drama, but 
changed it afterwards, with sufficient reason, to 1594. Chalmers supposes 1592 as the year wherein 
this comedy was written, but gives no satisfactory cause for his preference. The original edition of 
this play is doubtless lost, for the oldest copy extant, dated 1598, is said, in the title page, to be 
" newly corrected and augmented." In 1597, it was represented at Wliitehall palace, before queen 
Elizabeth, by her express desire — we are then to suppose that we possess the copy of the piece as it 
■was " newly corrected and augmented" for the purpose of exhibition before her majesty. 

We have said that there is no autho.ity extant for the assu nption that Shakspeare personated 
Armado, even at the command of her majesty the quean. At the same time, if he played in ^®

BURTONS GENTLEMAN S MAGAZIN: 



piece, he was likely to select tlie character of the thrasonical Spaniard, inasmuch as the broad hu- 
mors of the other masquers rendered them unavailable to an actor of our poet's calibre, and the parts 
of the dashing and witty courtiers were above his pitch. 

In Ben Jonson's Every Man in his Humor, his name appears attached to Old Knowell; Adam, 
in his own As You Like It, was another of his assumptions. In Seganus, his name appears 
amongst the comedians — although we know that his ghost in Hamlet was one of his best perform- 
ances, and that he occasionally figured in vaiious of his kingly characters, such as the Fourth, Sixth, 
and Eighth Henrys in his own historical plays. 

The last mention of Shakspeare's name as an actor appears in the list of characters attached to 
Ben Jonson's play of Seganus, published in 1603. 

Queen Elizabeth frequently indulged in witnessing dramatic performances, produced at her own 
expense, within her own palace walls. The Cotton MSS. contain various charges made in the ac- 
counts of the Master of the Revels for velvets, silks, cloths of gold, etc., for setting forth the stage 
In the very first year of her reign, there is a notice of the players being stopped in their perform- 
ances in consequence of the objectionable matter which they represented. " The same day at nyghS 
(Christmas) at the quens court, ther was a play afor her grace, the whych the plaers plad shuche 
matter that they wher commandyd to leyff off, and continently the maske cam in dansyng." Ne- 
vertheless, we find on the same authority, that on the twelfth night following, " a skaffold" for the 
play was set up in the hall, and " after play was done ther was a goodly maske, and after, a giett 
bankett that last tyll midnyght," 

The " skaflTold in the hall" sounds rudely to a modern ear, as the chief appliance and means of 
dramatic display in the palatial abode of the queen of England. But the public stage was in its in- 
fancy at the time of Shakspeare's birth, and the conveniences and elegant fittings wherewith the 
drama of the present day is graced, were unknown to the most ardent well-wisher of the stage in 
the early days of Elizabeth's reign. Chalmers observes " that what Augustus said of Rome may be 
remarked of Elizabeth and the stage ; he found it brick and he left it marble." At her accession in 
1558, no regular theatre had been established, and the players of that period, even in the capital, 
were compelled to have recourse to the yards of great inns, as the most commodious places which 
they could obtain for the representation of their pieces. These being surrounded by open stages and 
galleries, and possessing hkewise numerous private apartments and recesses, from which the gen- 
teeler part of the audience might become spectators at their ease, while the central space held a tem~ 
porary stage, uncovered m fine weather, and protected by an awning in bad, were not ill calculated 
for the purposes of scenic exhibition, and most undoubtedly gave rise to the form and construction 
adopted in the erection of the licensed theatres. 

In consequence of Elizabeth's patronage, the drama rapidly assumed an important stand. A re- 
gular play-house was built in the Blackfriars in 1570, and in 1574, Burbage's regular company of 
players was established by royal license. Before the sixteenth century expired, fouiteen distinct 
companies of players exhilirated the golden days of good queen Bess, Shakspeare's name appearing 
on the list enrolled by lord Warwick and the lord Chamberlain. Theatres, of course, proportionately 
increased ; and during the time that Shakspeare immortalized the stage, not less than seven of these 
structures, of established popularity, were in existence, with various others of ephemeral notoriety.

Your gloiious standard launch againj 
To meet another foe ! — Camp. 



INTRODUCTION. 

The frigate Constitution has a deathless fame. There is a charm in her simple name that arrests 
the eye, and rivets the attention of the cursory readei. Old Ironsides! Why the hare mention of 
this sobriquet carries us back to the days of Nicholson and Talbot, to the actions with the Guerriere, 
the Java, and the Cyane and the Levant; and we fancy that we hear the roar of her cannon, the 
blast of her bugle, her cry of enthusiasm as she went into battle, and her loud huzza as she came 
out victoriously ; — before us, a Hull, a Bainbridge, and a Stewart appear, together with a host of 
other choice spirits, both officers and men, who trod her blood-stained decks, and shared her impe- 
rishable glory. Her picture is in almost every dwelling ; she marks the covers of toy books and 
paper reams, and hangs over the door of the seaman's rendezvous. The backwoodsman, in his log 
cabin amid the western forest, has counted her guns, and puzzled over her ropes. Every nation un- 
der heaven has seen her; and her deeds have been the talk of the civilized world. Tiuly, she is 
the lucky ship of our navy ! the pride of every patriot, and the boast of every American citizen ; 
and, sooner than surrender her to an enemy, every son of this vast republic should feel willing to 
go down with her to the blue depths of ocean with her drums beating and colors flying, and hear 
with pleasure the thunder of the scowling wave as it closes over her " pennon, spar, and sail." 

It is usual when men of mighty genius, of gallant bearing, of holy zeal, and of noble ancestry, ap- 
pear on this mundane sphere, for some contemporary to give a minute account of their lives and ac- 
tions ; and so far is the custom carried at the present day, that the curtain of domestic life is clewed up, 
and we are shown the mysteries behind the scenes. Will it be considered strange, then, if one shall 
■write a series of sketches of the deeds of the gallant Constitution 1 Surely, if each Httle great man 
has his Boswell, Old Ironsides shall have her trumpeter ! 

In the following pages, fact will be blended with fancy in such a manner as not to murder truth, 
and the author will endeavor to twine for himself a wreath from the inexhaustible laurel that now 
blooms from the stump of her keel, and hangs around her frame. Startling incidents from each 
cruize will be taken from authentic sources, and what has been omitted by the pen of history, will 
be added hy that of memory. In many instances, the details of others will be copied, taking care 
never to do so, without making proper acknowledgment in the notes at the bottom of the page. 
Having trod the deck of this noble frigate, and heard the piping of the gale through her rigging, and 
the thunder of her cannon above the shifting valleys of ocean, the author feels confident that he shali 
he able to serve up the dear old ship like a skilful cook, in a hundred different ways, and unfold 
many a deed of high and noble daring. 



EARLY HISTORY. 

Tlie frigate Constitution was laid down at Boston, Mass., under an act of Congress, approved 
March 27lh, 1794. She was modelled by Joshua Humphreys, Esq., of Philndelphia, — the father of 
the present talented Chief Naval Constructor, — who likewise modelled the frigates President, Uni- 
ted States, Chesapeake, Constellation, and Congress. She was rated a forty-four gun ship, but like 
all other rated ships, both English and American, she carried more guns than were named. She 
had thirty port-holes on the gun deck, and twenty-four on the spar deck, and her number of service* 
able cannon was fifty-four. She carries that number now. 



14 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

On the 30th of September, 1797, she ghded into her natural element amid the shouts of thousands 
of spectators, who had collected to witness the novel sight, and had she not stuck on the ways at an 
earlier period, she would have been the first vessel launched under the new organization of the navy. 
As it was, she was baptized with blood — a ship carpenter, by the name of Champney, having been 
killed by the falling of one of her shoars. 

On the 20th July, 1798, she got underway for the first time, under the command of Captain Sa- 
muel Nicholson, a gallant officer ; and in August cruized with four revenue cutters along the coast 
of the United States, to the southward of Cape Heniy. At the close of the year '98, while under 
the command of Captain Nicholson, she was attached to the West India squadron, commanded by 
Commodore Barry. In 1799, she became the flag ship of Commodore Talbot, on the St, Domingo 
station, and here she commenced her gallant career. 

Having thus brought the old ship down to the commencement of the present century, we leave 
the reader to learn her farther history from the following sketches and anecdotes. 



CUTTING OUT A LETTER OF MARQUE. 

Of all services of danger which a naval officer has to perform during a time of war, and there are 
^uany, the task of cutting out an armed vessel from under the guns of an enemy's foit, and bringing 
-her out of the harbor in safety, is considered the most desperate. Coolness and courage must travel 
hand in hand there; and the successful commander of such an expedition, under the most favorable 
circumstances, must consider himself well off if he earns his laurels at the cost of blood. 

The sun was slowly descending behind the blue peaks of San Domingo, when an American -fri- 
gate came in sight of the village of Port Platte, situated at the head of a small liaibor on tire south 
■side of the island, and, furling her courses, hove to, for tlie pui-pose of reconnoitering. After scan- 
iiing narrowly the little anchorage, the frigate put about, and, setting her courses, was soon lost amid 
the shades of night. The inhabitants of the village had felt great alarm at the near approach of the 
armed ship, and had reinforced their fort, beside sending a number of soldiers on board of the letter 
of marque, Sandwich, formerly a British packet, but now in the service of the French, which lay 
close under the guns of the fort, wheie she was receiving a cargo of coffee, previous to her making 
a run for France. 

It was in the year 1800, just after the action between the Constellation and La Vengeance, and 
Uic name of the conqueror, Truxton, passed from lip to lip with instinctive consternation. Night 
came on; the moon had not appeared, and scudding clouds obscured the stars. The reveilM had 
been beaten at the garrison, and the inhabitants of Port Platte had retired to dream of the daring 
cruizers of the American squadron. The frigate, when she had lost sight of the island, came about, 
and under easy sail stood in for the shore. She was the Constitution, Commodore Talbot, and from 
the silence that reigned throughout the ship, and the total absence of light from the battle lanterns, 
the most careless observer would have supposed that she was about to do sometliing for the glory of 
the old thirteen. 

As she drew nigh the port, two officers might have been seen at the gangway, watching narrowly 
the lights that twinkled ahead. At this moment, the heavy roar of a cannon came echoing along 
the waters, and then one after another, the lights disappeared, until none were seen but those which 
seemed to be designed to burn throughout the night. 

" Now is your time," said the elder of the persons to the younger ; "have the second cutter man- 
ned, sir, and come to me for farther orders." Thus saying, the commodore, for it was he, looked at the 
compass and entered the cabin. In a few minutes, a knock at the cabin door, announced the arrival 
of some officer to make a report. 

" Enter," said the bluff old commodore, and immediately lieutenant Hull, the first of the Consti- 
tution, stood before him. 

" Are you ready 1'' said the commodore. 
" All ready, sir," replied the lieutenant. 

" Then, sir," said the commodore, " you will enter the harbor of Port Platte without being dia- 
covered, ascertain whether the ciaft that lies under the guns of the fort is the Sandwich, and when 
you shall have done so, return and make a report to me." 

" How shall I ascertain that fact without boarding her 1" said the lieutenant. 
" You will know her to be the Sandwich," replied the commodore, " by the black stripes around 
her white masts, and by the shortness of her bowsprit. Make haste, sir, for I long to give you a 
job." 

The lieutenant smiled as he bade the commodore good night, and, immediately ascending, gave 
such orders to the officer of the deck as he deemed necessary under the citcumstances of the case. 
The night was pretty well advanced as Mr. Hull wrapped himself in his boat cloak, and seated him- 
self in the stern sheets of the second cutter. 

" Shove off— let fall — pull cheerily, my boys," were the orders he gave, in a low voice, in quick 



OLD IRONSIDES. 15 

SQCCession ; then passing swiftly around the frigate's stern, he pulled for the harbor, and was soon 
lost sight of. 

For two hours, nothing was heard of the adventurous ofircer or his boat, and the old commodore 
began to grow quite anxious about them. Already a pale streak stretched itself along the eastern 
waters, and the clouds giew thinner and fewer, while here and there a star peeped out, and was re- 
flected back by the waves below. 

" Boat ahoy '." challenged the sentinel at the gangway of the Constitution, as the dash of oars at 
this moment fell upon his ear. 

"Aye! aye !" replied the officer of the boat, and soon lieutenant Hull crossed the gangway of the 
^ip. 

" It is the Sandwich, sir," said the lieutenant, after reporting his return, and paying the custom- 
ary salute. 

" Are you certain!" said commodore Talbot. 

" I am, sir," replied the officer, " for I lay directly under hex stern, and heard through the cabin 
•windows, which were open, her officers congratulating themselves upon the departure of the Con- 
stellation, for such they deem this ship to be. Beside, I noticed her masts and bowsprit, as I swept 
along under the guns of the fort — they are as you described them to be." 

" I'll have her, by ," said commodore Talbot, as he looked again at the harbor, which began 

to show itself amid the haze of dawn. " About ship, sir — set all the studding sails," and, bidding 
the heutenant good night, the commander in chief bounced into his cabin. 

The frigate swiftly came about, and took her departure from the land. Soon the studding sails 
on both sides were spread out to the wind, and, like a mountain of snow, she danced along upon 
the bosom of the deep until her morning watch looked out in vain for the blue outline of the island 
of San Domingo. 

" Sail O !" cried the look-out. 

" Where away ?" said the officer of the deck. 

" On the lee bow, sir," replied the seaman. 

" Can you make her out 1" hailed the officer. 

«' She is a sloop, sir, and shows American colors." 

" Hoist our ensign," said the lieutenant. 

" Aye, there comes the Sally in the nick of time." said the commodore, who had left the cabin at 
the first hail. " Mr. Hull, make a signal for hei to run down and speak us ; we will soon proceed 
to business." 

In a short time, the sail, which proved to be the American sloop Sally, came alongside of the Con- 
stitution. After a conference with her captain, he and his crew came on board the frigate, while 
lieutenant Hull, with a party of seamen and marines, the latter led by the brave captain Carmick 
immediately repaired on board of the sloop. Having received orders from the commodore, the sloop 
now put her helm up, and ran for the island. 

" In the course of the night, while running down for her port under easy sail, a shot suddenly 
flew over the Sally, and soon after an English frigate ranged up alongside. Mr. Hull hove to and 
when the boarding lieutenant gained the sloop's deck, where he found so large a party of men and 
officers in naval unifoims, he was much surprised. He was told the object of the expedition how- 
ever, and expressed his disappointment, as his own ship was only waiting to let the Sandwich com- 
plete her cargo, in order to cut her out also."* 

It was about^noon of the following day when the sloop stood in to the harbor of Port Platte. Be- 
fore her lay the Sandwich, with her broadside bearing on the approach ; and in the rear of her at 
no great distance, a battery shov/ed its long row of black teeth for her protection. 

Lieutenant Hull had sent nearly all the men below, before he entered the harbor, and now, having 
a stern anchor ready, he bore down, like a short-handed lubberly sloop, for the bows of the Sand- 
wich. As he drew nigh the ship, he said, in a low voice, " Stand by to board," and soon a large 
number of men crouched under the bulwarks, ready for action. 

" You will be afoul of me," said the lieutenant of the Sandwich, who was leaning carelessly over 
the bulwark as the sloop came down. 

" I think I shall," was the laconic reply. In a moment, the sloop struck the bows of the enemy. 

" Let go the kedge '." thundered the lieutenant — it was done like magic. 

" Boarders, away !" cried he ; and, seizing his cutlass, he crossed the gangway of the Sandwich 
at the head of his men, and carried her without a struggle. 

Captain Carmick, in the ship's boats, now landed, carried the battery, spiked the guns, and retired 
without the loss of a man. 

A great commotion was nov/ perceptible on shore ; but the commander and his crew went swiftly 
to work to secure their prize, and, though she was dismantled above her deck, and her guns stowed 
in the hold, before sunset she had her royal yards crossed, her guns scaled, and her crew quartered.

Siie now got under way, with the American flag at her ensign-peak, and stood out of the harbor in 
company with the sloop. 

Evening vras slowly fading into night as a ship, followed at some distance by a sloop, boie down 
for the Constitution. 

" Hail the stranger," said commodore Talbot. 

^' What ship is thati" thundered the officer of the deck, through his trumpet. 

" The United States ship Talbot, I. Hull, commander," replied the victorious officer, as he drew 
near enough to be distinguished by the othcers of the frigate. 

" It is Hull, by heavens !" said the commodore. In a few minutes lieutenant Hull came on board 
and made his official report. After a short time, the Sally's captain and crew were returned to their 
vessel, with many thanks, and lieutenant Hull, having received orders to that effect, repaired on 
board the prize as her commander, and, crowding on all sail, followed the commodore to Jamaica. 



APEEPATMOKOCCO. 

In 1803, we find our favorite ship, bearing the broad pendant of commodore Preble, entering the 
Mediterranean, to battle with the powers of Barbary. Octol)er 6th, 1803, the frigate Philadelphia, 
captain Bainbridge, captured off Cape de Gatta a cruizer belonging to the emperor of Morocco, call- 
ed the Meshboha, of twenty-two guns, Ibrahim Lubarez, commander, with a crew of one hundred 
aaid twenty men. This vessel having piratically seized the brig Celia, of Boston, commodore Pre- 
Me, in the Constitution, accompanied by the Nautilus, and the return squadron of commodore Kod- 
gers, sailed for Tangier Bay, for the purpose of convincing the brother of the sun and moon that a 
war with the United States would inevitably result in the destruction of his piratical navy, 

Tangier is situated on the northern coast of Africa, but a short distance from Cape Spartel. It 
£S a walled city of Morocco, and is rarely if ever visited excepting by market boats and vessels of 
war, on account of the long quarantine which is imposed by ports higher up the Mediterranean, 
upon all vessels who may have touched there. It lies thirty miles west of Gibraltar, is strongly foi- 
tified, has fourteen thousand inhabitants, and is the principal sea-port of the Moors. 

Its appearance from the sea is beautiful. Castles and forts of white stone, with the blood red flag 
•floating over each baslioh ; numerous white buildings, with the flags of every commercial nation 
waving in the breeze above them. Groves of orange and cypress trees towering above the walls, 
Hiark the foreground ; while far in the blue distance, the mountains of Mauritania towering in gran- 
deur, and to the left, and nigh at hand, the wild and broken summits of Mount Abyla — or in com- 
3cnon parlance, Apes Hill — rising high above the straits, complete a picture which, for variety and 
beauty, is rarely equalled in the Mediteiranean. If you turn to the opposite shore, you behold, peep- 
ing out from its beautiful olive groves, the little town of Tarifa, in Andalusia, celebrated as the spot 
where the Moors first landed, undei Taric el Tuerto, and commenced the conquest of Spain ; and far- 
ther out from the main land, you see its light-house, pointing the wandering mariner to the passage be- 
tween the pillars of Hercules; and, farther up the straits, behold "Dark Calpe's frowning steep," 
rising like a watchful lion to guard the sunny sea. 

In an inexhaustible' stone quaiTy near the city, which has been worked from time immemorial, to 
supply the Moors with mill stones, there stood a pillar, with an inscription upon its base, which in- 
formed the reader that it was raised by the wandering Canaanites, who had been driven out of their 
land, " flowing with milk and honey," by Joshua, the son of Nun ; and from the solid blocks of 
stone that lie about the entrance, and the great extent of the excavation — which reaches out to the 
sea — it requires but a little stretch of the human mind to believe that the children of Anak once 
labored there. 

It was sunrise at the straits of Gibraltar, when an American squadron stood by Tarifa point, and 
liove to in the bay of Tangier. The shores were sleeping in misty splendor, as the commodore furl- 
ed his topsails and made a signal for the squadron to anchor. Having secured the ships, a salute of 
twenty-one guns was fired, with the flag of Morocco floating at the fore, which was speedily answer- 
ed by the battery on shore. Freedom and slavery now lay side by side ; the stars and the stripes, 
and the bloody ensigns of the corsairs, waved together in the breeze, while the rattling of the Con- 
sxitution's drums mingled with the clashing of the Mussulman's cymbals. It was a stirring hour — 
the emperor's household had heard the roar of artillery, and wonder sate upon every countenance. 

It was yet early in the morning when the most sublime and mighty prince of Mauritania, aroused 
from his quiet sleep in his drowsy harem by the report of the Constitution's cannon, repaired to the 
divan, and held high court. There was a scowl upon his brow as he twisted his magnificent mus- 
tachios, and his thin lip curled in scorn, while his dark eye flashed with unusual brilliancy. Be- 
fore him, were the abject subjects of his will, and myriads of heads bent down in homage as he 
seated himself, while his body guards, in jewelled robes and spotted turbans, with pomp and pride, 
took their stations behind his ottoman. At length, beckoning to the bey, he said — " What dogs are 



OLD IRONSIDES. IT 

these which disturb our ro3aI sleep before the hour of morning prayer 1 Hasten, Hassan, and bring 
us information." 

The bey informed him that a large squadron of American vessels of war had anchored in the 
harbor. 

" Mishalla !" said the emperor, with a look of apprehension, " let them be attended to." 

A white flag now streamed from the nearest bastion, which was answered by a similar display 
from every ship in the squadron ; and then a boat shot from the side of the Constitution, with a 
noble-looking oflicer in her stern-sheets, whose uniform showed him to be a captain in the navy of 
the United States. He was commodore Preble. In a short half hour, the emperor gave the gallant 
commodore an audience, and Mr. Simpson, the American consul, was placed upon a footing with, 
the consuls of the most favored nations. The emperor, through his interpreter, expressed his regret 
that any difference had arisen between the two nations, disavowed having given any hostile orders, 
and declared that he would punish any of his governors who had. He then gave an order, under 
his seal, for the release of the American brig Hannah, her cargo and crew, detained at Mogadore ; 
and the commodore gave up the Meshboha, the vessel taken by captain Bainbridge, and the Mis- 
houda, the vessel taken by commodore Rodgers, at an earlier period of the war. Having smoked a 
pipe and drunk the coffee of the most illustrious Moor, the commander of the squadron was about 
to retire from the presence chamber, when the emperor suddenly clapped his hands. Hassan Bey 
stepped forwaid. " Bring me the pen of my father, and the treaty made between him and the new 
world," said he, " that I may sign my name, and afHx my seal to it." 

The pen and the parchment scroll were then brought in, and Hassan Bey, having unrolled the 
latter on his bended knees, the emperor, in the presence of his divan, made his mark and affixed his 
seal below the ratification of his father ; and it is just to state, that ever afterwards he observed its 
stipulations with the strictness of an honest Mussulman. Three years ago, this treaty, which was 
to continue fifty years from its date, expired, and a new one was entered into, which is now in force. 
It is not a httle singular that the frigate Constitution, at the request of the consul of Tangier, made 
her second appearance off that port in 1836, to hasten a treaty with the emperor of Morocco. Will 
she, fifty years hence, be ready to do the same thing ? God grant it. 

After the usual ceremonies of leave-taking, the divan broke up ; the commodore then repaired on 
board his ship, and fired a salute ; the consul hoisted his flag again over his consulate, and the squad- 
ron getting under way, the Constitution stood up the straits followed by the Nautilus, while com- 
modore Rodgers and the return squadron proceeded to the United Slates. 

There is nothing like loaded cannon for expediting the consummation of a 'treaty with the Moors, 
and the only tribute that will satisfy them for ever, must consist of thirty-two pourvJ shot. There 
is no mistaking the meaning of such presents, and when offered by a Preble, from the deck of the 
Constitution, they — as we shall see hereafter — protected the flag, and increased the glory of his na- 
tive land. 

At midnight, as the Constitution, under easy sail, was beating up for Gibraltar, " she suddenly 
found herself alongside a large ship. Some hailing passed, without either party giving an answer ; 
commodore Preble, who had taken the trumpet himself, now told the name and country of his ship,, 
and his own rank. He then demanded the name of the stranger, adding that he would fire a shot 
unless answered. 

" ' If you fire a shot, I'll return a broadside,' was the reply. 

" Preble sprang into his mizen rigging, applied the trumpet, and said — ' This is the United States 
ship Constitution, a forty-four, commodore Edward Preble; I am about to hail you for the last time ; 
if not answered, I shall fire into you. What ship is that V 

" ' This is his Britannic Majesty's ship Donnegal, a razee of sixty guns.' 

" Preble told the stranger he doubted his statement, and should lie by him until morning, in order 
to ascertain his real character. He was as good as his word, and in a short time, a boat came from 
the other vessel to explain. It was an English /rig-a^e, and the Constitution had got so suddenly 
and unexpectedly alongside of her, that the hesitation about answering, and the fictitious name, had 
proceeded from a desire to gain time, in order to clear the ship and to get to quarters. The spirit of 
commodore Preble on this occasion produced a very favorable impression in his own ship ; the young: 
men pithily remarking, that if he was wrong in his temper, he was right in his heart."* 

The next morning, the Constitution came to anchor off Gibraltar, and thus ended the war with-. 
Morocco.

THE HOMEWARD BOUND 



'TwAs calm on the waters — and night had drawn on 

Her mantlet of sable, her bright starry crown, 

And deeper each moment the azure sky grew, 

The billow reared darker its bosom of blue, 

The mermaid was leaving her deep coral cave, 

To joy in the stillness that reigned o'er the wave ; \ 

Ere the last smile of day o'er ocean did fade, 

On topsail and mast-head and pennant it play'd. 

The vessel was gallantly cleaving the spray, 

With canvas wide spread on hei homeward bound way, 

And full many a heart beat madly that night, 

As Hope whispered the morrow would bring land in sight. 

The moon rode on high — and her fair streamlets fell 

Alike on the deck and old ocean's proud swell, 

Tinged each mast, spar, and cord with her silver pale, 

And with sjiots of dark shade deck'd each half furled sail. 

On the helmsman — it glanced — and on one it shone, 

That over the taffrail was leaning alone : 

His bright eye seemed fixed in the distance afar. 

Yet heeded not billow, nor moon-beam, nor star. 

For the smile on his lip, the glow on his cheek, 

The heave of his breast 'neath his folded arms, speak 

A spirit already that's nestled at home. 

Where liight eyes and warm smiles cheer the end of his roam. 

One hour fled on — God ! what changes were there I 
O'er ocean and sky hung the shroud of despair ; 
The billows seemed striving the heavens to scale. 
And dashed their white foam in the face of the gale ; 
While now and anon came the sea-maids' wild shrieks 
In such blood-freezing tones as no mortal tongue speaks; 
jVot a star -ray broke thro'. the storm's drifting rack 
To guide that lone ship on her tempest crost track, 
But the fitful flash gleamed from the low hanging cloud. 
And showed how the tall masts were broken or bow'd — 
And drowning yells, caught 'mid the water spirits' dirge. 
Told of wretches engulphed in the v/ reek-sweeping surge. 

Still night on the waters — on wings of the blast, 
O'er the face of the moon, were clouds driving fast, 
And thro' their rent masses ller radiant beams broke, 
Pure, bright as they did ere the storm demons woke. 
Yet where was the bark that on ocean then rode, 
A thing full of life — Hope's smiling abode 1 
The sea-mew scream'd shrill round a sad mastless wreck 
That was tost by each wave without guidance or check : — 
Where were her gallant crew? — that sea-bird's scream rung 
The knell of the lone wretch to life who yet clung — 
One last sigh he breathed to those weeping at home. 

Then o'er him in wreathes curled the billow's white foam ! G, 

Philadelphia April 2d. 



THE ENCOUNTER 



Tho tuneful morn arose with looks of li^ht — 

The ear UiatclrauU her music's call was chill : 
The eye that shone was Sealed in endless night • 

And cold and still 

Tlie pulses stood that 'neatlfcergaze were wont to thrill.

Evert village which has seen its third generation, and every public building -which has survived 
the peltings of a half century's storms, claim as a part of their natural possessions, a larger or smaller 
portion of legendary lore. It is the powerful principle of association which imparts its interest to the 
antique dwelling or dismantled tower ; and as we gaze upon them, the imagination pierces the mist 
of the past and enlivens the scene with beings of its own creation. We go back to years long since 
commingled with the ocean of eternity, and see the busy actors of life's drama, as they performed 
their parts in the particular acts assigned them; and although they have flitted off the stage, the the 
atre of their performance is still before us. It affords us pleasure even when we are thrown solely 
tipon our imagination for persons and incidents to complete the scene : but the effort is less when we 
are supported with the principal events by history or tradition. 

No public building, perhaps, of the same age, affords as much food to the lover of incident, as a 
college. Changing its occupants every year ; its inhabitants collected promiscuously from all ranks 
of society, and possessing every possible shade of character and temperament, — its history must ne- 
cessarily be diversified. If the walls of our older institutions had tongues, how many thrilling tales 
of high anticipations, youthful enthusiasm, powerful effort and blasted hopes, might they disclose ! 
I have often listened to the breeze as it sighed through the long halls of our building, and imagined 
that it bore to my ear the merry peals of laughter which have rung through its chambers, mingled 
with the low sighs of many a hardened heart which has told its sorrow to that heedless breeze. 

There is one tale of grief connected with our alma mater, which has floated among us as a con- 
stituent part of hei earlier history. About thirty years ago, among the many who were here engaged 
in the enthusiastic strife for literary acquirement, there were two young hearts whose warm currents 
have long since been frozen in death. The rising sun of their hopes was early shrouded in a dark 

cloud which cast a melancholy shadow over the history of their lives. T of Kentucky, was a 

young man of respectable parts, but bold, passionate, and supercilious. Although his talents might 
have gained him respect, his disposition created an aversion to him among his companions and fellow 
students. He had that haughtiness in his carriage which is always sure to render a member of a 
society, as united as that of a college, disagreeable and unpopular. In the assignment of chambers 
he obtained as his room-mate a young gentleman who differed as much from him in disposition as 

the zenith does from the nadir. C was a quiet gentle soul. He possessed those qualities which 

secured him the warmest aflections of all around him. Although in delicate health, and generally 
pensive and retiring, the natural kindness and warmth of his feelings which gushed up like a full 
spring, endeared him to every one who formed an intimacy with him. As they differed so much iu 
their disposition, it is not to be expected that their mutual company would be agreeable. For some 
time, however, the restraint which a slight acquaintance imposed, prevented an exhibition of impro- 
priety on the part of the former, or uneasiness in the latter, but as they became more familiar, the 

spirit of T showed itself in unkind treatment to his room-mate. The sensitive heart of C 

could not brook the continued injury and unjustifiable abuse which was heaped upon him day after 
day. The presence of his insulter rendered his room the most disagreeable place on earth to him, 
and when absent his mind brooded over the incurable wounds which had been inflicted upon him. 

We gave T warning that a continuance of his conduct would be visited with retribution; but 

still he persisted in the same treatment which he before observed. In an evil hour C sent him a 

note, demanding gentlemanly satisfaction. The challenge was accepted, and the necessary preli- 
minaries arranged. 

********** 

Day was just dawning, and the pencil of light which streamed across the eastern horizon, pro- 
claimed the rising morning. The stars had not yet ceased to be visible. The citizens of our quiet 
tovsm were yet wrapt in the arms of sleep. To a verdawt lane within sight of the college, two small 
groups of persons were seen to move. ' There was a solemnity in their deportment which indicated 



20 



BURTON S GENTLEMAN S MAGAZINE. 



that the occasion which called them out was not one of a lively nature. They moved with a firm,r. 
decisive step, as though neiving themselves to receive some sudden shock, or witness a painful catas- 
trophe. They stopped when they reached the lane, and a few minutes Vv^ere spent in conversation, — 
quick and hurried, — as though they feared that some superior force would suspend their operations. 

It was a duel scene. The ground wasmeasured ; the frail form of C and the tall person of T 

took their assigned station as the principal actors in the tragedy about to be enacted. Their weapons 
■were handed them, and each intent upon the horrid purpose of taking his brother's life, prepared to 
send his stained soul into the presence of a pure God. 

It was a moment of dread suspense. Hearts were beating then which might soon cease to pulsate 
forever. The shrine of many a holy affection and feeling, which if properly cultivated would have 
led them to honor and happiness, might soon be irreparably destroyed. The sun which should soon 
salute the earth with his blessed light, would look upon the happy homes of their childhood, where 
they had been caressed by the fondness of parents and friends, and where they were still remembered 
"with the kindest solicitude. Perhaps his first rays would greet an afleclionate mother in her chamber, 
mingling the most fervent petitions for her son's happiness with her morning orisons; and that son 
might be lost to her for ever. With quick succession, such thoughts passed through their fevered 
brain. A moment — a report — and the deed was done. C was wounded and fell. The re- 
mainder of the party, influenced by a dastardly cowardice wliich deserves to be branded, fled with 
precipitation. 

There lay the dying one, alone. The stream of his heart's blood was gurgling through the wound, 
and as he fell with his head down a declivity, it rushed through his throat, choking him with it&amp; 
warm current. It was vain to struggle with death. He had challenged the monster to the combat, 
and now felt his inabihty to meet him. And then to die in such a situation \- — with no kind friend 
to support the drooping head, and wipe the death-damp from the brow. Doubtless as he entered the 
dark avenue to the other world, fond memory presented the bright images of past joys, of kind sisters, 
of affectionate friends. In vain the earth put on her vernal robe, — he had looked upon her beauties. 
for the last time. It is painful to be ushered into the eternal world under any circumstances; but 
how terrible it is when we rashly tear aside the curtain which veils that future state of existence 
iirom us, and read upon the broad orb of eternity, our own condemnation. 

A melancholy fate is recorded of T . Warned by the spirit of his murdered companion, he 

left his native country, and sought to banish his painful feelings by visiting foreign lands. 

Ccelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt. The image was still before him : it abode 
Twith him in private, followed him in public, and glared fearfully upon him in his midnight dreams. 
It preyed upon his mind until settled dejection took place, which finally terminated in decided in-» 
sanity. A wild maniac, he roamed over Italy. The balmy breath of her zephyrs brought no calm 
to his soul ; he regarded not the famous softness of her sky. He, who had been nursed upon the 
lap of luxury, depended on the cold charity of those to whom he was bound by no tie but that of 
common humanity; his haughty spirit was broken, and the pround superstructure of his mind was a 
desolate ruin. He laid him in that stranger land, where no kind friend could pen his epitaph.

A SONNET. 



Still do thy waters flow, on which looked down 
The Seven-hilled city, from its pride of place, 
"Which mirrored forth its glory and its grace : 
Oh ! thou whose dicta shook the world, whose frown 
Made mightiest monarchs tremble on their thrones 
And bend in homage to thy conquering sway. 
Art now a heap of monumental stones : 
There, human greatness, shrouded in decay. 



Owns the vain-glory of usurping pride, 
Whose bubbles rise and sink on time's swift tide ; 
Still rolls, unchanged, imperial Tiber on. 
Though the rich splendors of its shores are gone. 
Thus rivers flow, though their proud cities fall,

THE ARREST. 



TRANSLATED F R O 51 THE FRENCH, 



" The debtor cannot be arrested before the rising nor after the setting of the snn.''— Code ilcpro, civ. art. 78 J. 



If you have hitherto escaped the grasp of the sheriff's officers, if the cuffs of your sleeves have not 
yet been defiled by the bailiff's touch, you can form no conception of the bitterness of an arrest. It 
is one of those unspeakable sensations which you will not again experience, save in Tartarus; thatis^ 
if old Minos shall think fit to condemn you. A few days ago, I was still free in that anomalous liberty, 
which knoweth not the clear light of heaven, and defendeth itself from the sun. Ferreted out by the 
commercial blood-hound, I was forced early in the morning from my ensconcement in a garret, where 
I was sleeping, neither well nor ill, until such time as it would be day with me, and still night witli 
the rest of mankind. Last Friday, as the town clock was striking eight — 

" The owl is commencing its flight," said a young woman, (the confidante of my misfortiisse,) 
through the key-hole. 

" Thanks, blue-eyed angel, with black hair," I replied, in aromantic tone of voice ; " since the ianip 
of heaven is extinguished, the cat may go out upon the gutters." 

With these words, I put on a light surtout, and directed my uncertain steps toward the Palais Eoy- 
al. Arrived near the bank, I mechanically cast my eyes upon the playbills of the day. 

"Theatre de Madame — First representation of 'The Setting of the Sun.' Comedy vandeTiDe; 
M. Perlet will perform the character of Aigentieres." 

Capital ! My instinct as a debtor irresistibly hurried me to such a representation. I entered pre- 
cisely as the curtain rose, and took the first seat that offeied. 

Aigentieres was just like myself, a night-bird; invited to a soiree, it there chances that he forgets 
himself, amid punch and the card-tables. At the rising of the sun he dares not venture into the 
streets, for he has perceived from the window a visage of bad omen : 't is that of a sheriff-officer, 
planted at the door of the hotel like a gibbet, and awaiting his victim with fatal vigilance. It was 
necessary, then, that Argentieres should devise a thousand pretexts for remaining at his post till even- 
ing. 

"How shall I manage"!" exclaimed Perlet. 

His embarrassing position drew from me an exclamation and sympathetic applause. My right 
hand neighbor, a very troublesome fellow, applied his glass and eyed my countenance with an im- 
pertinence truly provoking. I silently contented myself with turning my back to him, and offering^ 
a more befitting view; but the fellow, whose gaze partook somewhat of the satanical, ceased notfrcirj 
his scrutiny of my person ; above all, at that moment when the v/inding-up of the piece extracted a 
new burst of sympathy. My patience was exhausted, and I gave him an intentional push, hy acci- 
dent. 

" My dear sir! your address," said he to me, while re-adjusting his glass, which had been deraugedl 
by my abrupt motion. 

" Ah! very well," added he, reading the name and number of my street; "you shall see me, sir, 
early to-morrow morning." 

" You will oblige me, sir, by coming very early." 

" I shall not fail, I assure you." 

And as we quitted each other his glass was still pursuing me. I slept ill ; I am no coward, hut a 
duel occasions restlessness even to the man most philosophically detached from life. At six o'clock 
came a knock at my door; it was the quizzing-glass fellow, accompanied by two gentleman of a sx^~ 
ficiently pleasant countenance. 

" Gentlemen, I am at your service." / 

" You shall not escape us, sir." 

" These two pistols will decide our difference." 

" Quite useless, sir, we have here every thing requisite for us." 

" Since you are armed, then, at all points, we can depart." 

" At all points," replied he with a sneer, " that is the phrase ; let us get into the coach^'"

burton's gentleman's magazine. 



"Where are we going 1" 

"Rue de la Cle, sir." 

"How, Ruede la Clel" 

" By virtue of the peremptory decree issued against you on the first day of June, by the tribunal 
of commerce, duly registered, and to you notified, a petition, etc. etc., I arrest you, in the king's name : 
that you may not remain ignorant, I beg leave to inform you, that I am an officer in the guard of 
commerce, and these gentlemen are my satellites." 

At these words I fell into a lethargic despondency, from which I was not roused until I heard the 
grating of the lock of Saint Pelagic, as it closed behind me. 

" Another time," said I, " catch me giving my address to the first wrangler that comes to hand, and 
thus compromising my existence as a free man, for the sake of making a show of empty bravery." 

The reflection is excellent, but comes, unhappily, a little too late, like all other reflections in which 
tlie prisoner indulges within the walls of Saint Pelagic. J. G. W. 



THE CURSE OF THE FLOWERS. 



At the coming of dawn, ere the sun 
Had his visible course begun. 
And song burst from every bill ; 
Whilst the earliest breezes were chill. 
And the dews on our hearts and our homes 
Lay sweet as our balm in bee-combs ; — 
In the sultry succeeding of noon, 
When in the pale azure the moon 
Lay faint as the faintest of clouds, 
And we swoon'd in our emerald shrouds ; — 
At the graceful survening of even. 
Ere twilight shed sleep upon heaven ; 
We were cheer'd thro' the beautiful hours 
By bands of our sweet sister-flowers : — 
But' scarce had the sun's loving eye 
Look'd its last from the golden sky. 
When a creature that seem'd of the skies, 
By the light of her eloquent eyes, 
By her cheeks, and her lips, and her tresses, 
And the bed where they lay in caresses. 
And the grace of her form and its motion, 
Came amidst us ; and seeming devotion 
To our beauty and fragrancy paid. 
And with love-looks our droop'd lids survey'd: 
But ruin pursued her regard ; 
And bloom after bloom from the sward, 
And bud after bud, did she sunder ;, 
And o'er her white bosom and under 
With passion fantastic array'd them, 
And for joy with death-dreariness paid them : 
That now, in the light of the stars, 
Our sorrow dew'd slumber debars ; 
And the spii it of life in our veins, 
Of bereavement eternal complains; 



I And when the new dawn shall arise 
I On the verge of the orient skies, 
'Twill but vex the shut grief in our eyes I 

For this murder of those that we cherish'd ; 
Whose life in her selfishness perish'd, 
May she love, and be answcr'd with scorn, 
And her heart with vain cravings be torn ! 
Which to glut, with mere limb may she mate, 
And then sicken with loathing and hate; 
Whilst the life which her blood must allume, 
Doth but gasp thro' one breath to the tomb, 
And she drag on from mori'ow to morrow, 
To lorn death thro' a desert of sorrow ! 

But, if by the love she will vow, 
Which deep in her young blood doth grow, 
And which springeth, and springeth, and springeth 
And grace all about her forihbringeth — 
Never more, with a merciless hand. 
To make spoil of our innocent band 
But leave us to live, love and die 
At God's will, in the breath of his sky; 
And the beam and the dew of our birth 
Still feel as we wither in earth — 
We revoke every spell of our curse ; 
And its tenor heart-blighting reverse ; 
May her fond love, by fond answer met, 
Never droop in the shade of regret ; 
May she kiss, and still kiss, and adore ; 
Till the dream which enchanteth be o'er ; 
May she bee-drain the sweets it can gi've. 

And die when 'tis sorrov/ to live !

THE WHITE CK.OSS 



A BRAZILIAN S T K Y . 



BY LIEUT. C X E , U. S. A E, M T 



The coui-se of true love never did run smooth. 



Is all the bay and harbor of Rio de Janeiro, so often described by travellers as one of the most ca- 
pacious, and certainly the most beautiful in the world, no portion is so beautiful or possesses so 
much of the romantic and picturesque as Botafogo Bay, one of the many parts which unite to con- 
stitute the beauteDUS whole first mentioned. 

Brazil, justly styled the garden of the world, has no spot equally fair with tliis, and while wan- 
dering midst its verdant fields and in the depths of its forests, where 

" nor dint of hoof nor print of foot 
Lay in the wild luxurious soil ;" 

a traveller might well imagine he had at last reached the spot so long sought after, where our first 
father saw and wooed the fairest, first of women. Eve. 

To return, however, to the Bay of Rio, completely shut in on three sides by lofty hills and moun- 
tains covered with perpetual verdure, high among which the towering corcovado rears its head, like 
a blasted pine in a grove of beauty; groves of orange trees, filled with the "golden apple" scattered 
in every direction by the tasteful and profuse hand of nature, give a rich beauty and softness to the 
scene, while in bold relief are seen the massy Gavia and the well known sugar-loaf, nature's hand- 
marks, to guide the weary mariner to the " haven where he would be :" all that is wanting to com- 
plete the picture is the massy fort of Santa Oruz, "bristling horribly" with 

" those mortal engines, whose rude throats 
The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit," 

and presenting an impassable barrier to the entrance of the harbor, at the mouth of which it is situa- 
ted. 

The shores of Botafogo Bay are lined with villas of surpassing beauty and neatness of architecture ; 
among which stands pre-eminent that of the late beautiful Countess of Santos, a monument at once 
of the fiailty of its fair occupant and the munificence of her imperial lover, Pedro the First. 

I have been thus particular in the description, or rather in this poor attempt at description, of this 
lovely spot, from its being the scene of the events I am about to narrate ; and as the facts upon which 
this " ower true tale" are founded, did actually occur. I might in compliance with the long observed 
rule of scribbling, premise, " that the actors in the drama, or some of them, being still alive, delicacy 
forbids me to disclose their names, etc." Such, I believe, is admitted to be a privilege of long stand- 
ing, and I might be disposed to avail myself of it, but for the simple reason, that I do not know the 
real names of any one mentioned in my story, although I once heard them ; nor do I know whether 
they are ahve or dead, but I think I hear my fair reader exclaim, (while more than half inclined to 
throw away this nonsense,) the story, sir, the story ; thus, then it is : 

In the year 18 — ; but before I proceed any farther, I ought to tell you how I became acquainted 
with the facts I relate, and begging the pardon of any one, whose patience has accompanied me thus 
far, for drawing a little more upon their stock thereof, I will, in as brief a way as possible, state the 
the how, when, and where. 

It was on an evening of surpassing loveliness, such as is no where seen but in the tropics, that 
after having spent a day of solitude in my hammock, trying by inactivity and passiveness to escape 
the heat, as the thermometer had been playfully ranging from 90° to 100° in the shade, with no 
society but my Byron, my own thoughts, (poor company, I think I see you preparing to remark, so

that I will save you the trouble by confessing it myself,) and though last, by no means least, a choice 
"Havana," the which I can confidently recommend to every one, as the greatest of luxuries in a 
warm climate, where was I, oh ! I had just got out of my hammock, (another luxury,) and deter- 
lermined to enjoy to the utmost the coolness of the evening. I entered my canoe, and with my only 
attendant, (cook, valet, and chambermaid, " trio juncta in uno'' as Sheridan said,) paddled down the 
harbor from my cottage on the Island of Cobras, until we arrived at the mouth of Botafogo Bay, 
which we entered ; whilst paddhng round the bay and resigning myself to the control of spirit en- 
gendered by the fairy like appearance of the scene, I observed a white cross painted upon the rocks, 
which near the entrance of the bay, reach to the water's edge. 

Having never before noticed it, I was considerably astonished at the sight, as these crosses are 
usually the "memento mori's" of some murder that has been committed on the spot where they are 
erected, and I could not believe that the hand of the assassin would have invaded a sanctuary like 
this. 

On inquiry, I gained from my companion, a venerable Brazilian, the following particulars, which 
I give you rendered into English, and stripped of numerous digressions on his part, during the nar- 
ration, which would most certainly not interest you, any more than I fear mine have. 

In the year 18 — , the Martini palace which was located a short distance from Botafogo bay, in the 
direction of the city of Rio de Janeiro, was not more celebrated for its grandeur and magnificence, 
than for its owner, the Marquis Juan de Martini ; — cold, haughty, and reserved in his manners, he 
was liked by no one ; secluded almost altogether from the world, he appeared to feel no interest in 
any one around him, and but for one circumstance, the fact of his existence even would have been 
forgotten, so rarely did he appear in public. Like Jeptha, he had one fair daughter, and her he did 
indeed love passing well. 

Isabel de Martini had long been celebrated as the fairest of the fair, in the imperial city of St. 
Sebastian; her dark eye beaming with intelhgence, was surmounted by a brow of perfect symmetry, 
and her raven locks playing loosely about her sculptured neck, gave her an almost elf-like appearance. 
Beauty cannot be described, and any description would fall short of what Isabel really was; let every 
one draw from his imagination for her image, for she was lovely as imagination can conceive ; would 
that I could do so, but although a worshipper of the fair daughters of Eve, almost to idolatry, I never 
yet could transfer their charms to paper : sirffice it then to say, that among all the dark eyed beauties 
of this sunny land, who stand unrivalled both for form, and face, Isabel de Martini shone pie- 
eminent. Many were the admirers, and among them many of the proudest nobles of Brazil, who 
had sued for the honor of her hand, and all in vain ; to all she turned an inattentive ear, and if the 
truth must be told, the fair Isabel was just the least in the world of a coquette, and however much 
her vanity might be flattered by seeing her train of admirers swelling with the noble and the rich, 
she passed along unmoved by any, " fancy free." 

Pass over a year in the life of our heroine, and go with me to the shores of the bay I have de- 
scribed to you ; the moon was shining with its silvery light upon the still waters of the bay, which 
clearly as a mirror, reflected all around it, yet no object Was reflected half so fair as the forms of Isabel 
and a young man, who, with his arm around her, was gazing on his companion with an expression 
of the deepest afl'ection. Long they walked, and if we do not give you the subject of their conver- 
sation, it is for the two-fold reason, that being lovers, it was necessarily of a character uninteresting 
to a third person, and moreover, I did not hear a word of it; time flew, but still they strolled along 
the tranquil margin of ihe bay, and it was the lady who first observed the lateness of the hour, and 
spoke of returning. 

" Do not detain me longer," she said, " indeed, indeed, Fernando, I must leave you ; my absence 
will be remarked, and though for myself I care not, still your safety as much as my own, demands 
that we should be prudent ; indeed we must separate, but 'tis only till to-morrow." 

" Dearest Isabel," replied her lover, " how can I ever sufliciently repay you 1 you, the admired of 
all, the loveliest of your sex, thus to brave all for me — and must we part? would that the time were 
come, when we will fly together far from this hated place, and secure from all pursuit, live only for 
each other." 

" Once more, then," said Isabel, "good night; for my sake, be careful of yourself, and remember 
that my existence is dependant upon yours. God bless you, good night." 

The youth folded her in his arms, and hastily impressed a kiss upon her brow, which was of a 
marble paleness, and .then releasing her, the maiden disappeared among the rocks; he gazed after 
her for a few morirents, then casting off" the fastening of a canoe, which lay concealed in a small cove 
beneath, he sprang into it, and rapidly plying his paddle, in a very brief space he reached the op- 
posite shore, and disappeared. As the scene just described may appear a little strange to those whose 
patience has carried them thus far, it v;iil be proper to state the particulars of the acquaintance 
which had arisen between our heroine, and the evident object of her choice. 

At a public ball given by the Emperor, to which not only the nobility, but all the respectable in- 
habitants of Rio were admitted, the fair Isabel was as usual the cyrrosure of all admirirrg glances ; 
and while to all their flattering speeches she turned an inattentive ear, she was much struck with 
the appearance of a young stranger, who although not belonging to her own rank in life, was evident- 



THEWHITECROSS. 25 

ly one of " nature's noblemen," and she secretly acknowledged to herself that had any of her previous 
admirers but resembled him, her heart had not been so difficult to subdue; — never had she ex- 
perienced such sensations as those which now possessed her, and she was pleased, although unable 
to define the cause, to observe that he was evidently gazing upon her with an eye of sincere admira- 
tion. 

He was the son of a captain in the Imperial Army, who had fallen in the service of his country, 
and had left his son wholly dependant upon his own exertions for support. Long had he gazed 
with admiration amounting to idolatry, upon the lovely Isabel, whom he had often seen in pubhc ; 
never before, however, had he been thrown so directly into the society of one, whom, he felt, to see 
was to love ; and now that he could at leisure gaze upon those charms, he resigned himself to the 
control of his passion, and with a thrill of transport, observed that his admiration was noticed, and 
was evidently not disagreeable to its object. The last person noticed by Isabel, on leaving the ball, 
was the stranger, whose eyes were still intently fixed upon her, and if a responsive glance fiom her 
met his eye, who shall blame her 1 

In this country, where intrigue is the chief business of life, but little difficulty occurred in his con- 
veying to his " lady love" the intelligence that he lived but for her; and it would be tedious to nar- 
rate the manner in which he obtained his first interview with her. The greatest difficulty which 
arose was lespecting the place of meeting, until chance disclosed to them a path leading through the 
mountains from the Martini palace to the bay ; there in the face of heaven, alone, the lovers met in 
the still hour of midnight, and with the resplendent moon, and all the heavenly •' isles of light" alone 
for witnesses, told their love, and spoke of future happiness. 

Much difficulty attended their meetings, as it was necessary for Isabel to await the retiring of all 
the family, before she could leave her chamber, which she was enabled to do by means of a private 
door, communicating with the garden. Anxiously would she remain in the solitude of her apart- 
ment, until the entire cessation of noise within the house, bade her fly to her appointment ; then in 
her lover's arms, with no thought for aught on earth save him, in whom were centred all the resist- 
less feelings of her heart, would she be for a time completely happy ; as few will deny, that the en- 
joyments (and especially those of this description,) of which we partake by stealth, are more intense 
than those which we possess sanctioned by all around us. 

Thus had they met in secret, for several months, and now only awaited the sailing of a vessel, 
whose captain (convinced of the propriety thereof, by the argument of a well filled purse) had con- 
sented to receive them on board, and carry them to some far distant land, where secure from oppo- 
sition, and revenge, they might be happy in each other. But I am delaying the catastrophe too long, 
and will forthwith proceed to the denouement. 

To enable Isabel to carry into efifect her plans for meeting her lover, it had been necessary for 
her to make a confidante of a servant, whom she believed to be devotedly attached to her ; avarice, 
however, reigned triumphant in her soul, and she betrayed the secret to her mistress' father, for a 
sum of money. His rage at learning the disgrace thus brought upon his house, for as such he con- 
sidered it, cannot be described. 

I felt, but cannot paint his rage, 

If. 

He determined at once upon a terrible revenge ; that he might be certain of the fact, he had fol- 
lowed Isabel on this, their last night of meeting, and unseen, had been a witness of the lover's in- 
terview; he could scarcely restrain himself from at once rushing upon, and destroying the devoted 
lover, but he did so, and returned to his palace with the fixed resolve, that this meeting should be 
their last. 

On the following night, he took measures to detain his daughter in conversation for an hour be- 
yond the appointed time, and several of his servants were stationed at the place of meeting with 
orders to assassinate the unfortunate object of his wrath, on his arrival. 

At the appointed hour, Fernando hastened on the wings of love, to meet his mistress ; another 
night of beauty seemed to hallow his intent : nature was at rest, and the bright moon shone . coldly 
down, only to light him to his death ; with a light heart he entered his canoe, crossed the bay, and 
arrived on the opposite shore ; before he had time to notice and wonder at the absence of his mistress, 
the assassins' daggers were in his heart ; he died with her name upon his lips, and leaving him where 
he fell, the murderers fled. 

The moment that Isabel could disengage herself from her father, she humed to her room, and re- 
gardless of her former caution, flew to her appointment; her father watched, and at a distance fol- 
lowed her ; she soon reached the spot, and oh ! what a sight of horror met her eye ! hei lover, whom 
she last saw in all the radiant pride of beauty and of youth, now lay dead before her, pierced with 
many wounds, and covered with his blood ; she threw herself frantically beside him, hoping that 
some spaik of life might still be unextinguished. Such hopes, however, were in vain ; and as the 
thought flashed upon her that she had been betrayed, she gave herself up entirely to the horror and 
anguish of the moment ; it was but for an instant, however, for rising rapidly, she rushed with a 
frantic scream to the water's edge, and throwing herself into the depths beneath, which possessed no 
terrors for her, she sank to rise no more.

Her father had followed her to enjoy the sight of the betrayer of his house, (as he supposed,) 
lying dead before her, and to upbraid his daughter with the dishonor she had brought upon him. He 
was too late, he arrived but in time to see her sink beneath the wave. 

The waters wild, went o'er his child 
And he was left lamenting. 

The cross I saw is the sole monument to the unfortunate lovers. Such is the story I listened to, 
and I only regret my inability to do it greater justice ; such as it is, however, it is true, and many of 
the inliabitants still can tell of the surpassing beauty and tragic end of the fair and unfortunate 
Isabel de Martini.

EARTH AND OCEAN. 



A RHAPSODY, 



How beautiful, mother earth! thy varied scenes to me : 

Whether the cultured landscape smile with soften'd majesty, 

Or, in thy sterner aspect, rocks in wild confusion rise 

Abrupt, magnificently grand, their summits in the skies: 

Whether thou gleam'st with winter's sheen, or spring's gay smile dost wear. 

With summer blossoms cloth'd, or pale leaves of the dying year; 

Though 'neath night's star-inwovcn mantle wrapt in sacred gloom, 

Or blushing in the morning light, all fragrancy and bloom. 

Or basking with voluptuous looks in noontide's fervid ray. 

Or smiling through thy dewy veil meekly at close of day : 

Still, mother eaith ! in every mood, in every varied change. 

My heart could almost worship thee — so wonderfully strange. 

And thou, ocean ! beautiful, most beautiful thou art, 

And ever to my care-worn soul fresh joy dost thou impart. 

Whether fierce-wing'd with tempest-wrath, thou battiest with the sky. 

Or, like a cradled infant, singest thy low-sweet lullaby : 

In all thy shifting forms, I see the wonder-working skill 

Of laim who wakes thy wildest rage, or whispers " peace be still!" 

Thou mighty reservoir ! vast cauldron ! ever pouring forth 

Into the spongy air thy mists to fertilize the earth ; 

Like the heart's life-blood bubbling through each artery and vein. 

Returning by unnumber'd tubes back to the fount again ; 

So sea-fed clouds descend, springs gush, and rivers feed the main. 

Ocean! I never gaze on thee but solemn musings fill 

My eyes with tears, my heart with an unutterable thrill. 

Thou two-fold emblem ! of eternity thyself ; thy waves 

Of time, which rising from thee, find within thyself their graves. 

Vast as thou art, the moon's behests thou dost perforce obey ; 

And as she bids, dost rise or fall, obedient to her sway. 

Great moral lesson ! did we thus to virtue's rule conform, 

Ne'er should we mourn the wreck of peace amid our passions' storm.

THE WASTE LANDS. 

A TALE. 

BT THE AUTHOR OP "WIID WATER POWB 



She had a song of— Wjllovi'— 
An old thing 'twas, but it expressed her fortune. 
And »he died singing it : that song, to night. 
Will not go from my mind. 

Othello. 



There lies in the north of England a considerable tract of land, now known by the name of the 
Waste Lands, which once formed the richest property of two wealthy families by whom untoward 
circumstances had caused it to be deserted. For some time, it was looked after by stewards, too much 
bent upon profiting themselves to regard the interests of their employers. The tenantry, who, drain- 
ed of their hard earnings, were obliged to vex the land till it became a bed of stones, dropped off one 
by one. The hedge-rows, being unremittingly assisted in the progress of decay by the paupers of 
the neighborhood, were soon reduced to nothing but dock-weeds and brambles ; which gradually 
uniting from the opposite ends of the fields, the property became a huge thicket, too encumbered 
ever to be worth clearing, and only valuable to poachers and gypsies, to whom it still affords abundant 
booty and a secure hiding place. 

The two mansions have kept pace in ruin with the lands around them. The persons left in charge 
of them, being subject to no supervision, put themselves but little out of their way to preserve that 
which was so lightly regarded by the owners. Too careless to repair the dilapidations of time and 
the weather, they were driven, by broken windows and rickety doors, from office to office, and from 
parlor to parlor, till ruin fairly pursued them into the grand saloon ; where the Turkey carpets were 
tattered by hob-nails, and the dogs of the chase licked their paws upon sofas of silk and satin. In due 
time, the rain forced its way through the roofs, and the occupiers having no orders to stop it with a 
tile, the breach became wider and wider. Soon the fine papering began to show discolored patches, 
and display the lath and plaster which bulged through it ; then the nails which supported the family 
portraits gave way with their burthens; and finally, the rafters began to yield, and the inhabitants 
wisely vacated the premises in time to avoid the last crash, rightly conjecturing that it was useless 
to leave the moveables behind to share in the common destruction, when there was so little likelihood 
of their ever being inquired after. 

Thus ended the pride both of HeronclifT and Hazledell, which may still be seen, from each other, 
about a mile apart, shooting up a few parti-colored walls from their untrimmed wildernesses, and 
seeming, like two desperate combatants, to stand to the last extremity; neither of them cheered by a 
sign of Ufe, excepting the jackdaws which sit perched upon the dead tips of the old ash trees, and 
the starlings that sweep around at sunset in circles, within which the country folks have rarely been 
hardy enough to intrude. 

The last possessor who resided at Hazledell was an eccentric old bachelor, with a disposition so 
composed of kindness and petulance, that every body liked, and scarcely any one could live with him. 
His relations had been driven away from him, one after the other ; — one because he presumed to 
plead the poverty of a tenant whom the old man had previously resolved upon forgiving his rent ; 
another, because he reserved the choice bin of the cellar when wine was prescribed for the sickness 
of the poor; and a third, because he suffered himself to be convinced in politics, and destroyed a fair 
subject for arguments which were intended to afford time to his company for discussing their good 
cheer. 

There was but one person who understood him, and this was his nephew; who continued to the 
last his only companion, and kept him alive solely by knowing how to manage him. He had the 
good taste never to remind him of his years by approaching him with that awe which is commonly 
demonstrated by young people towards the old ; and the tact to observe exactly where his foibles 
would bear raillery, and where they required sympathy. He could lead him from one mood to another, 



20 burton's gentleman's MAGAZINSe 

so thai the longest day in his company never seemed monotonous ; oi if he rambled away amongst 
the neighborhood, he could return at night with a tale of adventures which sent him to bed without 
repining at the prospect of to-mwrow. Unluckily the old man considered him too necessary to his 
comforts to part with him ; and though merely the son of a younger brother, without fortune or ex- 
pectations, he was not permitted to turn his mind to a profession, or to any thing beyond the present. 
The youth, however, was scarcely twenty -three ; and at such an age, a well-supplied purse for the 
time being leaves but little anxiety for the future. 

With a good education, picked up as he could by snatches, a sprightly disposition, and a talent 
equal to any thing, young Vibert of Hazledell was as welcome abroad as he was at home; and it 
■was argued that his handsome figure and countenance would stand him in the stead of the best pro- 
fession going. The young ladies would turn from any beau at the country-ball to greet his arrival, 
and never think of engaging themselves to dance till they were quite sure that he was disposed of. 
One remarked upon the blackness of his hair, another upon the whiteness of his forehead; and the 
squires who weie not jealous of him would entertain them with his feats of horsemanship and adroit- 
ness at bringing down, right and left. Still Vibert was not spoiled ; and the young ladies pulled up 
their kid gloves till they split, v^'ithout making any visible impression upon him. His obstinacy was 
quite incomprehensible. Each ridiculed the disappointment of her friend, in the hope of concealing 
her own ; and all turned for consolation to the young master of Heroncliff. 

Marcus of Heroncliif, was nearly of an age with Vibert, and was perhaps still more popular with 
the heads of families, if not with the younger branches ; for he had the advantage of an ample fortune. 
His person, also, was well formed, and his features were, for the most part, handsome ; but the first 
had none of the grace of Vibert, and the last had a far different expression. His front, instead of 
being cast in that fine expansive mould, was contracted and low, and denoted more cunning than 
talent. His eye was too deeply sunk to indicate openness or generosity ; and the tout ensemble gave 
an idea of sulkiness and double-dealing. It was held by many that his outward appearance was not 
a fair index of his disposition, which was said to be liberal and good-natured. The only fault which 
they found with him was, that his conversation seemed over-much guarded for one of his age. He 
appeared unwilling to show himself as he really was, and the greatest confidence which could be re- 
posed in him produced no corresponding return. He walked in society like one who came to look 
on rather than mix in it ; and although his dependants lived in profusion, his table was rarely en- 
livened save by the dogs which had been the companions of his sport. 

Vibert, whose character it was to judge always favorably, believed that his manner and mode of 
life proceeded from the consciousness of a faulty education, and a mistrust of his capacity to redeem 
lost time. He felt a friendliness for him, bordering upon compassion ; and their near neighborhood 
affording him frequent opportunities of throwing himself in his way, a considerable degree of intimacy 
was, in course of time, established between them. Vibert was right, as far as he went, in his esti- 
mate of his friend's mind ; but he never detected its grand feature. Marcus was sensible that he was 
below par amongst those of his rank, and a proud heart made him bitterly jealous of all who had the 
advantage of him. It was this that gave verity to the expression which we have before noticed in 
his features; made him a torment to himself; and rendered him incapable of sympathising with 
others. If a word were addressed to him, he believed that it was designed to afford an opportunity 
of ridiculing his reply; if he chanced to be contradicted, his visage blackened as though he felt that 
he had been insulted. Vibert, so open to examination, was the only person whom he did not suspect 
and dread. They hunted, shot, -and went into society together ; and it was observed that Marcus lost 
nothing by the contact. His confidence increased, his reserve in some degree disappeared, and 
Vibert secretly congratulated himself on having fashioned a battery to receive the flattering attentions 
from which he was anxious to escape. His ambition, indeed, was otherwise directed. 

At a few miles' distance from Hazledell was a pretty estate, called Silvermere, from a small lake, 
■which reflected the front of the dwelling and the high grounds and rich timber behind it. It was 
inhabited by persons of consideration in the county, who were too happy at home to mix much with 
their neighbors. In fact, of a numerous family, there was but one daughter old enough to be in- 
troduced; and she was of a beauty so rare, that theie was little danger in keeping her upon hand 
until her sister was of an age to accompany hei into society. 

In this family, Vibert had been for some time a favorite, and had been fascinated on his first in- 
troduction to it. The beauty of whom we have made mention, and her sister, a year or two younger, 
■were placed on either side of him ; and it was hard to know whether most to admire the wild tongue 
and laughing loveliness of the younger — the fair-haired Edith ; or the retiring, but attractive dignity 
of the black eyes and pale fine features of the elder — the graceful Marion. They were, perhaps, both 
pleased to see the hero of the county conversations , but the younger one was the foremost to display 
it ; without being a flirt, she was frank, and had the rare, natural gift of saying and doing what she 
pleased without danger of misconstruction. 

The daring but femmine gaiety of this young creature speedily dispelled from the mind of Vibert 
all idea of his recent acquaintance. On his showing any recollection of it, she assured him that, on 
her part, the acquaintance was by no means recent, for she had heard him discussed as often as any 
Knight of the Round Table.

"To place you upon an equality with us," she said, " I will tell }'ou what sort of persons we are, 
and you can judge v.'hcthcr, at any future time, when your horse happens to knock up in our 
neighborhood, and your dinner to be five miles off, you will condescend to take advantage of us. 
Papa and mamma, who you see have been a handsome couple, and would think themselves so still 
if they had not such a well grown family, are by no means rigid, exacting, fault-finding, and dis- 
agreeable, like papas and ■mammas in general. They have had the good taste to discover our precose 
talents, and profit by being our companions instead of our rulers, from the time we learned the art 
of spelling words of one syllable, and doing as we were not bidden. Instead of scolding us for our 
misdeeds, they used to reason with us as to their propriety, and generally got the worst of the argu- 
ment ; so, saving that in virtue of our old companionship we make them the confidants of most of 
our dilemmas, they have brought us up charmingly undutiful and self-willed. 

"As for Marion, she is a young lady erroneously supposed to be the pride of the family, who pre- 
sumes to regard me with a patronising complacency, and to encourage me in the idea that, one of 
these days, I shall really learn to talk. She is a sedate personage, who tries to reflect upon things ; 
but, as the same deep study has shaded her brow as long as I can recollect, I imagine that she does 
not often come to a conclusion. Yet the falsely-styled pride of Silvermere does not blanch her cheeks 
in the unwholesome atmosphere of learned tomes ; nor by spinning the globes, nor by hunting the 
stars. Her character is a little touched with romance, and her study is how to mend a bad world, 
which continues aihng in spite of her. She gives all her consolation, and half of her pin-money, to 
a tribe of old dames and young damsels, who, under such patronage, only pull our hedges in greater 
security, or add fiesh colors to the costume which is to flaunt triumphant on the fair day. The 
urchins whom she teaches ' to guess their lessons,' and buys off from aiding in the toils of their 
parents, are the most mischievous in the neighborhood ; and, in short, things go on worse and worse, 
and poor Marion does not know what to make of it. From the humbler world, so different from the 
Arcadian affair of her imagination, she turns with despair to the sphere in which she is herself to 
move, and shudders at the prospect of disappointment there also. Where, amongst such a community 
of young ladies battling for precedence, and young gentlemen vowing eternal constancy to a dozen 
at a time, can she look for the friend of her soul, or the more favored being who is to console her for 
the want of one 1 Alas, the pride of Silvermere ! with feelings so delicate that a gossamer might 
wound them, how can she accommodate herself to any world but that of the fairy tales which de- 
lighted our nursery, or expect tranquility in any place but a cloister?" 

Vibert's calls were repeated often, each one affording a pretext for another, and each visit growing 
longer than the last. The father of his two attractions was required frequently by his affairs in 
London, where he spent weeks at a time, and their mother was generally confined by delicate health 
to her chamber. Thus Vibert's intimacy with them had but little ceremony to restrain its rapid 
advancement ; and he soon felt, what has perhaps been felt by many, that the simple smile of the 
dignified and retiring is more perilous than the brightest glance of wit and vivacity. Indeed, Edith 
was too gay to be suspected of any thought beyond that of amusement ; but the actions of Marion 
were more measured, and her approbation was the more flattering. Vibert laughed when he en- 
countered the first; but his pulse beat quicker at the sight of the last. 

There seems in the affairs of the heart to be an unaccountable intelligence, by which, without the 
use of external signs, the tremors of the one generally find their reverberation in the other. Often 
as Vibert entered to share in the morning amusements of the sisters, to give an account of the horse 
that he was breaking in for Marion, or the dog that he was teaching antics for Edith, it was im- 
possible for him to be insensible to an increasing flush of satisfaction at his appearance, and by de- 
grees he gave up all other society, and had no pastime to which Marion was not a party. Both 
young, both interested in the other's happiness, it was not likely that they should reflect how the 
brightest flowers may be the seat of poison, and the sweetest moments the parents of miser}'. Their 
intimacy became more confidential ; and Edith left them more and more to themselves to seek 
amusement elsewhere. Still theie was no question of love. Vibert knew that, without fortune or 
expectations, he could have no jKetension to Marion : and that the number of her young brothers and 
sisters must render it impossible for her father to remedy the deficiency. It was then that he felt the 
extent of the sacrifice he had made in devoting himself so entirely to his uncle. Had he adopted any 
profession, he might have obtained a home of his own, to say the least ; and, however humble that 
home might have been, would Marion have shrunk from it 1 Would Marion have failed to make it 
the richest spot upon earth 1 He was yet only of an age when many commence their career ; his 
mind was too active and too brilliant to suffer his habits to become ao fixed but that he could turn 
them to any thing. He determined upon breaking the matter to his uncle; and, as Edith was now 
eighteen, and the sisters were just about to appear in public, there was no time to be lost. If Marion 
were not to go forth with a hand already engaged, what had he not to apprehend! Fortune and 
honors would be at her feet — friends would reason — parents might command — and what had she to 
reply 1 She loved an idler who lived upon another's bounty, and whose future means were some- 
thing worse than precarious ! He seized upon what he thought a good opportunity, the same 
evening. His uncle was enjoying his arm-chair and slippers beside an ample fire, to which the pat- 
tering of a November storm gave additional comfort.

" Vibert,*" said he, " what have been youi adventures to-day 1" 

" I have been to Silvermere." 

« Folks tell me you have been there every day for the last twelvemonth — and who have you seen 
there]" 

« I have seen Marion." 

" Well, nephew, she is good-looking, you say; and sensible, and all that. Why do you not marry 
her, and bring her home to make tea for us 1" 

" Alas ! I would willingly do so, had I the means." 

"We can get over that obstacle, I think, by doubling your allowance." 

" My dear sir, you do not undeistand its full extent. Marion's family would never consent, unless 
she were to be the mistress of an establishment of her own." 

« We can remedy that, too, Vibert. Divide the house with me at the middle of the cellar, and 
brick up the communications. Divide the stables and the horses ; have new wheels and new arms 
to the old family rumble-tumble, and make any farther arrangements you please. You have been a 
good boy, to bear with a crazy old man so long, and I should not like you to be a loser by it." 

" My dear uncle, there was no need of this additional generosity to secure my gratitude, and my 
endeavors to prove it. I did not speak for the purpose of placing any farther tax upon you, but merely 
to consult you whether it were not better that I thought of some profession, by which I might attain 
a position in Ufe not liable to reverse." 

"A profession! — what, one that would call you away from HazledelH" 

" I fear all professions would subject me to that affliction." 

The uncle's color rose and his brow darkened. 

" Vibert leave me in my old age, when I have become entirely dependant upon him ! Vibert knock 
away the only crutch that props me up from the grave — bequeath me to the mercy of hired servants, 
with not a soul to exchange a word of comfort with me ! What fortune could you obtain which 
would compensate for reflections like these 1 

" Stay, nephew, and see me into my grave — the reverse which you apprehend — I never thought 
that you could so coldly contemplate my extinction ; but it is right and natural that you should do 
so. Only stay — and I promise you that I will not keep you long — I will curtail my expenses, banish 
my few old friends, dismiss my servants, and live upon bread and water, to save what I can for you 
from the estate. I cannot cause it to descend to you ; but, at all events, I can save you as much as 
you would be likely to make by leaving me. Yet, if it be your wish to go, even go ; I had rather 
you would leave me miserable, than stay to wish me dead." 

The old man had worked himself into a fit of childish agitation, and Vibert saw that argument 
Avas useless. 

" Uncle," he replied, with a look and voice of despair, " make yourself easy, Marion will find 
another husband, who will perhaps render her happier than I could, and I will remain with you as 
I have done hitherto." 

From this time, Vibert spared no effort to overcome his ill-starred passion, as well for Marion's 
sake as for his own ; seeking every possible pretext to render his visits less frequent, and to pay them 
in company. Marion perceived the change at the moment it took place, and, although she could 
not dispute its propriety, her sensibility was v/ounded to the quick. She commenced her first round 
of provincial gaiety with a fever at her heart, and an ominous presage of sorrow. 

The appearance of the Silvermere party formed an epoch in the annals of the county — and, as 
Vibert had forseen, there was not a squire of the smallest pretensions who did not address himself 
sedulously to make th** agreeable to them. They had little encouragement, however, in their at- 
tempts, excepting from Edith. Her heart was free, and her tongue was full of joy ; but Marion was 
looking for the return of Vibert; and the reserved glance of her eye kept flattery at a distance, and 
hope in fetters. Still he returned not — she never met him in society, but she constantly heard of 
his having been at balls and merry-maldngs where she was not. It was in the vain pursuit of his 
peace of mind ; and she was too generous to attribute it to any thing else. On his occasional visits 
of ceremony she received him as if nothing material had happened ; but the flush was gone from her 
cheek, and the smile that remained was cold and sickly. 

Meantime, rumor was liberal in assigning to each of the sisters her share of intended husbands, 
Vibert listened to the catalogue with all the trepidation of a lover who had really entertained hopes, 
Alas ! if that selfish principle of denying to another what we cannot enjoy ourselves be excusable in 
any case it is so in love. The loved object which belongs to no other still appears to be in some de- 
gree our own ; and fancy conjures up, in spite of us, an indefinable trust in the future, of which the 
total destruction falls like the blow of an assassin. It was thus with Vibert, when, after writhing 
long in secret anguish at the mention of any name connected with that of Marion, report from all 
quarters concurred in the same uncontradicted tale. Marion was receiving the addresses of Marcus 
of Heroncliff : of him, for whom he had himself, from motives of the purest kindness, secured the 
good thoughts of her family — him whom he had made the confidant of his love — him who had pro- 
fessed himself to be only waiting for encouragement to throw himself at the feet of her sister ! That 
he should have met him daily, and never hinted at the change in his intentions ! Yet might it not 



THE WASTE LANDS. 31 

have been that he feared to inflict piin 1 Tiiat he should have deserted Edith when his conduct 
had imphed all that was devoted ! Yet, was it not for Marion 1 But then, that Marion should have 
become the rival of her sister ! Yet, oh ! how soon she had overcome the remembrance of him, and 
how natural was it for the cold in love to become the faithless in friendship. Thus Vihert went on 
arguing for and against all the parties, and winding up with a forced ejaculation of — " It is nothing' 
to me — it is no atTair of mine." It was meant to confirm his pride, but only proved his wretched 
ness. 

Upon this principle, and from a sense of his want of self-possession, the name of Marion nevet 
passed his lips in the presence of Marcus, who, on his part, was equally silent. 

The report upon which this conduct was adopted was not so destitute of reason as those which 
had preceded it. Marcus, with the failing already noticed, was incapable of being a true friend ; 
and, though at his first introduction at iSilvermere, the marked intelligence between Marion and 
Vibert reduced him to the necessity of devoting his attentions to Edith, yet the circumstance of her 
sister's preference for another was sufhcient to kindle in his heart the most burning anxiety to obtain 
her for himself. "Without considering Vibert's earlier acquaintance, he felt himself eclipsed, and his 
honor wounded. The moment, therefore, that his friend's visits were discontinued, his own were 
redoubled. They were naturally, from his previous behavior, laid by the family to the account of 
Edith; and, upon this conviction, Marion often used him as a protection against the advances of her 
unwelcome host of admirers. If she was asked to dance, she was engaged to Marcus ; and his arm 
was always ready to conduct her to her carriage. It was observed that she received much more of 
his attention than was bestowed upon her sister; and insensibly their manner in public became the 
practice in private, where there was no need for it. His hopes rose high, and he scrupled not to 
advance them by endeavoring to extirpate the last kind feeling which he thought might yet linger 
for poor Vibert. One while he affected chagrin, and invented excesses on the part of his friend as 
the cause of it : at another time he was incensed at injurious words, which he alleged to have been 
employed by Vibert towards heiself. At last, when he thought himself quite secure, he disclosed his 
passion, and was rejected with astonishment. 

The sting, for one like him, had a thousand barbs : he loved the beautiful Marion with all the 
energy of a soul which had never before loved a human being. Common report, and his confidence 
in her resentment against Vibert, had made him consider her as already his own. His triumph over 
all the competitors that he had feared, envied, and detested, was, as he deemed, on the eve of com- 
pletion ; and now he was to be the object of derision and mock pity ! The means which he had 
used to ingratiate himself would probably be divulged. The inmost core of his heart would be ex- 
posed and scorned ; and Vibert, whom he felt to be the latent cause of his rejection, was, perhaps, 
finally to be reinstated, and to flaunt his triumph daily before his eyes ! The very evils which bad 
minds have attempted to inflict upon others, become a provocation to themselves: they have been de- 
feated, and therefore they have been injured ; and the rejected suitor returned home pallid and quiver- 
ing with an ague fit of mortal hate. 

The attentions of Marcus had never been discussed between the sisters until the occurrence of this 
'catastrophe. He left them in a shaded alley of the pleasure-grounds, which were beginning to be 
strewed with the yellow leaves of autumn ; and a clouded sunset cast a few long streaks across the 
sward, and made the deep recesses look still more sombre. 

There are few who do not feel a melancholy peculiar to this period of the year. Marion had a 
double reason; for it Avas about the same time in the preceding autumn, and in the summer-house 
but a few steps before her that she had passed the last happy hour with Vibert ! 

" Marion," said Edith, as they walked on, with their arms fondly resting upon each other's neck, 
" you are not well. It is long since you were well ; but I had hoped that the attachment of Marcus 
would have dispelled a deep grief, of which you forbade me ever to speak. I trusted that your heart 
had been arrested in its progress of sorrow, and I was silent, lest you should think me jealous of my 
sweet rival." 

" Heavens ! that my apathy should have been so great as to mistake his intentions. I only bore 
with him because I thought him yours." 

" Marion, I never should have wished him loved by yoii, had I not felt that your life depended on 
the diversion of your thoughts. I have been mistaken ; you have been dying daily, and, unless you 
would have me die with you, let me write to Vibert. Sweet Marion, let me write, as from myself, 
in my own wild way, merely to bid him come and dance on my birthday." 

"No, Edith, no. He would suspect the reason; it is too humihating. I have still pride enough 
left to save me from contempt, if not to support me from Edith, let us talk of other things." 

She leaned her head upon her sister's bosom, and both were weeping, when they were startled by 
the gallop of a horse, and a ring at the garden gate. Edith saw that it was the servant of Vibert, 
and she sprang hke a fawn to inquire his commission. He brought a letter for Marion, and thus it 
ran: 

" The relations who stood between me and the succession to the estates of Hazledell are deaa. I 
am now my uncle's heir; but I fear too late. The sorrow of withdrawing myself to my proper dis 
tance when I was poor is probably to be followed up by the anguish of being forbidden to return now

that I am licb. I dare not appear before you till I hear the refutation of your reported engagements 
with Marcus — till you bid me look forward to a termination of the misery which a feeling of honor 
&lt;2'bliged me to inflict upon myself." 

Marion sank for support against the ivy-twined pillar of the summer house. Edith kissed her pale 
«heek, and fondly whispered, " I told you so : what answer will you sendl" After the first moments 
of tremulous agitation — after an interval of silence, to lull the tumults of her heart, Marion merely 
ejaculated, " Poor Vibert ! I thought he had forgotten me !" 

"Bather say, poor Edith," replied her sister, with a burst of that natural gaiety which had of late 
almost forsaken her ; " poor Edith has now the willow-wreath all to herself. Alas ! for some 
doughty champion to twine it round the neck of the false lord of HeronclifT! 
" Here — here is a pencil — the servant waits for a reply." 

Marion tore the back from her letter, and wrote — " The reports are unfounded — the future is in 
3':our power." 

" Edith !" she said, when the messenger was dismissed, " give me your arm back to the house, for 
I feel faint. In the midst of all this happiness, there is a sickness at my heart — a strange boding, 
that I am only tantalized by chimeras, and meant for misfortune. Perhaps I deceive myself. Per- 
haps it is only the strange bewilderment occasioned by this revolution in all that interests me. I can- 
not help it." 

It was a gusty and querulous night. The old trees by their window groaned as though they were 
ia trouble, and the scud swept along the sky like a host of spectres, Marion's distressing fancies 
were not to be calmed, and grew even more excited by the restless and apparently preternatural 
spirits of her sister, who discussed their prospects in her wildest vein. She arranged that when 
Marien became the lady of Hazledell, she also was to call it her home, make herself the sole object 
of attraction and tournament to all the squires round about, and display her true dignity by remain- 
ing a scornful lady and a respectable maiden aunt. By degrees, her fancy ceased castle-building — 
■a few unconnected sparks of vanity grew fainter and fainter, and she dropped asleep. Marion had 
no wish or power to repose; her nervous sense of apprehension continued to increase; she tried 
every effort to direct her thoughts toother subjects, but they invariably became entangled, and again 
pressed with a dead weight upon her heart. In this mood she v/as startled by Edith laughing in her 
sleep, with a sound which terrified her. 

" Edith !" she cried, shaking her till she partially awoke ; " Edith — you frighten me — why do you 
laugh in your sleep V 

" I laughed," replied Edith, drowsily, and scarce knowing what she said, "I laughed at some one 
who preached to me of the vanity of human expectations." She again muttered a laugh, and a second 
iime diopped asleep. 

Notwithstanding the note of Marion, the night at Hazledell had seemed to bring with it a sense 
■of sadness, no less than it had done at Silvermere. Vibert's uncle had retired to rest with an ominous 
feeling of distress at the news of his deceased relations. After a while he had come back to shake 
hands with him again. The young ones, he said, were dropping about him, and leaving him desolate 
to lament the luckless humors which had impeded him from adding to their comforts as he might 
have done. Every joint of him trembled lest he should live too long. " God bless you, Vibert !" 
he added, " you have always been a good boy, and have borne kindly with my infirmities — God bless 
you ! God bless you ! Vibert, you will go to-morrow to Silvermere ? I have long prevented you 
from being happy, and you owe me no thanks that you arc so at last. Go to bed — you have grown 
thin from want of sleep ; and it is all my fault." 

He quitted him again with affectionate and almost childish reluctance ; and Vibert paced his room, 
in a fever of anticipation, till the rising of the sun, which had seemed as if it never meant to rise 
again. It was still too early to set out for Silvermere, but he knew that Marcus rose with the dawn 
for his field-sports, and his generous mind was unwilling to lose an instant in acknowledging and 
asking pardon for the suspicions which he had entertained of his friendship. He walked rapidly to 
Heroncliff, and found Marcus, as he had anticipated, up and dressed; in fact, he had passed the night 
■in the same manner as he himself had done, and his face looked haggard and wild. 
-" Marcus," said Vibert, " I come to tell you a piece of strange news " 

■■"J know it already," replied Marcus, with an attempt to look glad. " I met your servant going to 
'^SilvfiTOiere with it. Your uncles in India are dead." 

" I scarcely recollect them, and it would therefore be ridiculous to affect much grief for their loss; 
but the circumstance has been the means of showing me an injustice committed against yourself, at 
which I am sincerely grieved. I believed that you entertained an intention of supplanting me in the 
love of Marion; and although my reason had nothing to object to it, my heart felt that it was not 
the part which I would have acted towards you. I have accused you bitterly; but see, Marion has 
herself exculpated you ; and you must even forgive me as one who has been too unhappily bewilder- 
ed to be master of himself." 

Marcus took his offered hand and laughed, but with a fearful expression, which he strove to hide 
casting his eyes on the ground. 
-&lt;' Then Marion," he observed, " looks forward to being the lad}' of Hazledell 1" 



THE WASTE LANDS. 33 

"Ay, and to do the honors of it to her sister, the lady of Heroncliff. My son shall many your 
daughter, and we will join the estates in one." 

Marcus drew in his breath with a harrowing sound. 

" Vibert," he said, " we had best remain unmarried ; we are more independent to pursue our 
pastimes : we are not obliged to receive the society which is odious to us ; and, whilst we are free, 
we are the more welcomed abroad. Promise me you will think no more of it." 
■ " You would not ask it, if you felt, like me, that you were beloved by Marion. What do I care 
for independence and my reception abroad, when I have such a thraldom and such a paradise at 
home !" 

" You are determined, then ■?" 

" Can you doubt it 1 I am even now on my way to Silvermere. I should arrive too soon on 
horseback, and am therefore obliged to walk, for I cannot be easy till I find myself on my way 
thither. Come, take your gun, and accompany me." 

" I will accompany, in the hope of dissuading you, and bringing you back before you arrive there." 
" And I will drag you into fetters whether you will or not. Come ; it is time (o start, if we would 
be there by breakfast-time. What ails you 1 You look pale and shivering, this morning ; and see, 
for the first lime in your life, you have forgotten your gun." 

With that he kindly took it from where it stood, and presented it to him. 
" I will not take it," said Marcus, vaguely ; " I am nervous, and cannot shoot." 
" Tut, man ; take your gmi, I say ; a good shot will put you in spirits. There is an outlying deer 
from Hazledell in the Black Valley, and you must kill him for our wedding feast." 

Marcus bit his white lips, and did as he was bidden ; and the companions set out upon their walk. 

The weather was still gusty and uncertain. The faint gleam of the sun was rapidly traversed by 

the clouds, which seemed to overrun each other, in wild and fearful confusion. Several large trees 

■were blown across the pathways, and the crows skimmed aloft in unsettled course, as though they 

were afraid to perch. 

" How I love this bracing air !" said Vibert. " I feel as if I could fly." 

" You feel elastic from your errand. I have no such cause, and I would fain that the morning had 
been calmer. I think that long usage to blustering weather would have a strong effect upon men's 
passions, and render them too daring and reckless." 

As they descended the brow of fern and scattered plantations, from his bleak residence, his per- 
suasions that Vibert would return became more and more urgent. He used, in a wild, disjointed 
manner, all the vain arguments to which the selfish and the dissipated generally resort to dissuade 
their friends from what they call a sacrifice of liberty. They were easily overruled, and his agitation 
grew the more violent. In this manner they arrived at the entrance of the Black Valley, a gorge of 
rock, and varied earth, choked up by trees and bushes, chance-sown, by the birds and the winds. 
This valley was between two and three miles in length, its gloom was unbroken by a single habita- 
tion, and it had been the witness of many atrocities. It was a place usually avoided; but it was the 
shortest road to Silvermere, and Vibert never visited it by any other. 

" I do not like this valley !" said Marcus ; " we will take the upper road." 

" It is too far about — come on — you are not yourself this morning, and the sooner Edith laughs at 
you the better." 

They were making a short cut through the tangled thicket, from one path to another, and had 
reached a more gloomy and savage spot than they had hitherto encountered. Marcus sat down upon 
a piece of splintered timber, and motioned Vibert, with a gasping earnestness which was not to be 
disputed, to seat himself beside him. 

" Marcus," said the latter, as he complied, " your conduct is inexplicable. Why are you so 
anxious that I should not go to Silvermere, nor renew my acquaintance with Marion 1 You must 
have some reason for all this; and, if so, why conceal it from me 1" 

"If nothing short of such an extremity will induce you to follow my counsel, I must even come 
to it. Maiion is not what you have supposed her. You imagine that her love for you has kept her 
single. Ask of whom you will, if such be the general opinion. Till yesterday, she gave herself to 
another, who cannot aspire to a thousandth part of your merit, but who happened to be more favored 
by fortune. Last night, you became the richest, and she changed ; but would Vibert be contented 
with a partner who preferred another V 

" Marcus ! — this other ! It is of yourself you speak 1" 

" Ask all the world, if she did not make herself notorious with me. She made me distrust all 
womankind. Vibert, let us both leave her to the reflections of one who has deserved to be forsaken." 
" May it not be that you, and not I, have mistaken her 1 She might have preferred your company 
because you were my friend, and you might have fancied that she loved you because you loved her. 
It is needless to contradict me — men do not tremble and turn pale because their friends are going to 
marry jilts. I do not blame you; for not to love Marion is beyond the power even of fiiendship. 
Let us only be fair rivals, and not attempt to discourage each other by doing her injustice. Let us 
go hand in hand, and each prefer his suit. For my part, I promise you, that if you succeed, I will 
yield without enmity." 



34 burton's gentleman's i 

Marcus staggered as he rose. Vibert's countenance was grave but not unfrienJIy. 

" Go on then," said the former, in a deep broken voice, and with every feature convulsed ; at the 
same time, he turned himself homeward ; and Vibeit, seeing that it was advisable to part company, 
pursued his course towards Silvermere. Marcus made but a few strides and paused. He clenched 
his teeth, and cast a wild glance at his rifle — made one or two hesitating steps, and then bounded after. 

Long and intense was the watch which the sisters kept that morning in the direction of the Black 
Valley, but no one was seen to come forth from it. 

" In other times," said Marion, " Vibert could arrive to breaifast, and it is now long past noon." 

Edith was not mistress of the gay consolation which had so often turned a tear to a smile, and 
framed an excuse out of the wild and stormy weather, which it was evident her own heart could 
not admit. 

"He did not use to mind stormy weather," returned Marion. " Besides, we heard a shot fired, 
and we know that no one has the range of the Black Valley but Vibert and his friend Marcus." 

" It was, perhaps, only the cracking of some time-worn stem, giving way to the hurricane ; and, 
if it was a shot, we must take into consideration the peculiar nature of our cavaliers of the world, 
and make allowance for what they cannot help. How can we suppose that Vibert could pass the 
Badger's Bank without paying his compliments to the wild cat, or enjoying the shriek of the bird 
of prey that comes thither to tear his victim 1 He will be here to dinner, and make amends for his 
slowness by a strange tale of the wonders which caused it." 

" Edith, you are drawing the character of Marcus — this is not like Vibert." 

" Well, well, then — do not speak with such a tremor, and he shall be a bright exception ; and the 
only punishment he shall have is to be dismissed from your mind, just whilst I tell you why I have 
been thinking of the faithless Marcus. Do you listen 1 Yes. Why, then, dear Marion, I must 
have you guess the reason for my sage determination to obtain reverence as a maiden-aunt." 

" Edith !" 

" Yes, yes — I see you have guessed aright. 'Tis a false-hearted but, Marion, he was my first ; 

and to be deserted for you is not a crime which makes him an absolute monster. Come away from 
this window, and let us rest our eyes, for they have followed the battling of the kites and crows till 
Tve grow giddy, and dreamy, and fanciful. Come, come, my bride of Hazledell, and listen to the lost 
T?its of the soon undisputed pride of Silvermere." 

It was late in the day when they joined the rest of the family, and still no tidings had been heard 
of Vibert. There was a silence in the circle which proved that their uneasiness was not confined 
to themselves, and presently the consternation was completed by the mysterious countenance of a 
servant who called out his master. Marion and Edith clasped each other's neck in the sure presen- 
timent of something fatal. The truth was less cruel than their suspense, for though communicated 
with all the care and tenderness which its nature required, it left them insensible to the horrors of 
which they had been the victims. The sisters and the two friends were doomed never to meet again. 
The fate of Vibert had been discovered by the game-keepers as they were taking their evening round, 
by the spot where he had been left bleeding and breathless by the dastard hand of his rival. That 
of Marcus was best known to the fiends which pursued him. 

We will not swell our history with an account of all the gradations by which a thrilling horror 
may settle down to a calm and lasting woe. The first news which followed the foregoing events re- 
lated to Vibert's uncle. His infirm frame had sunk beneath his afiliction, and he lay in the family- 
vault beside his unfortunate nephew. Of Marcus, nothing had ever been heard. A stranger had 
been found, apparently self-destroyed, in a distant part of the country, but nobody had come forward 
to recognize him. There was, of course, a surmise that this might have been the fugitive, Marcus, 
and, whether true or false, he never gave grounds for any other. 

Years passed away, but the characters of Marion and Edith resumed no more their natural tone. 
The last was never seen to resume her smiles, nor the first drop a tear. Their feelings had been 
trampled down too rudely to spring again. What were their fates eventually is an inquiry of small 
importance — the history of their hearts is concluded.

THE ETERNAL FIRE 

ON THE BANKS OF THE CASPIAN SEA 



BT JOHN EICIIFELD, 



This fire is in the peninsula of Apsclieron, twenty versts from Baku, and is justly called one of 
the wonders of southern Russia. I have visited this spot. It is a burning desert, from the surface 
of which subterraneous (lames here and there issue, which are occasioned by the exhalations of the 
naptha. Though this fire ma}- not be eternal, yet it is extremely old, for there are traditions of the 
origin of simiUar phenomena* in other parts; for instance, in the Ural, on the river Mangischlak, 
in the village of Sulp-Aul (v. Pallas) and that which I have seen in Wallachia, on the little river 
Slanika, near the village of Lapatar, on Mount Klaschna. But the origin of the fire in the neigh- 
borhood of Baku is buried in the obscurity of the remotest antiquity. 

The first appearance of this fire, in an age when the phenomena of nature were so little known 
and explored, might appear supernatural. It is well known that Media was the seat of Zoroaster's 
doctrine, and the introduction of those mysterious receptacles of the eternal fire, which the Maho- 
metans every where destroyed. Only the miraculous flame of Baku arrested the blind fury of the 
Mahometans. The temple consecrated to fire is still preserved by the remnant of the ancient Parsees, 
or fire-worshippers, who, though scattered over the immense tracts of Persia and India, come hither 
to perform the prayers imposed on them by their vows. This temple, however, is no beautiful 
specimen of architecture, but a simple stone square, in the centre of which stands the altar, from 
which issues the eternal fire. The flat roof is supported on four columns, from which a constant 
fire, conducted by tubes, likewise ascends. On thg roof, above the altar, is a fittle belfry. 

On dark nights this temple is descried even at a great distance, and is the more interesting and 
majestic in the eyes of the traveller, as the brilliant flame does not resemble Vulcan's destructive fire, 
but is like some mystei:ious phenomenon awakening sublime recollections of antiquity. 

Within the wall which surrounds the temple, there are some stone houses, and a small garden, 
the residences of eight Parsee monks."|- During the time of worship, they strike the bell once, 
generally on their entrance into the temple, and then prostrate themselves before the altar. After 
remaining for a pretty considerable time in this position, they arise, strike the bell once more, and 
then finish their prayers. They give the fire the firstlings of every sort of food. They eat no meat, 
and live entirely on vegetables. Their particular affection to animals is probably the cause of it ; the 
guardians of the Holy Fire keep a great number of dogs, which they treat as friends and companions. 

It is evident that they prefer their religion to all others, and consider themselves as purer than 
other men, because they are favored with the purest notions of the divinity. In conversing with 
persons of a different religion, they protect themselves by certain prayers, which they repeat in an 
under voice. They seemed much displeased when my companions weie going to dress their dinner 
at the same fire as theirs. To satisfy them, I had the kettle removed to another part. When they 
carried water near us, they always cried out, Brama, Brama, Brama, doubtless to counteract our 
influence upon it. Perhaps they have a particular respect for water; at least, in remote antiquity, it 
was considered, by many of the followers of Zoroaster, as a divinity. 

The atmosphere in the temple, and in the surrounding court-yard, is very warm, on which ac. 
count the monks wear a very light clothing. 

It is reported that the monks, in former times, frequently made singular vows; for instance, to re- 
main for several years in a constrained attitude, with their arms raised, oi holding up one foot, etc. 

* They originated, at no very distant period, by the lightning having rent the upper hard layer of 
the mountain, which made an issue for the inflammable vapors, and, at the same time, caused the 
flames to arise. 

-\ The Europeans call them, as well as all other fire-worshippers, Guebers ; which seems to be a 
corruption of the Persian word Giaur, by which they designate all those who profess a different re- 
ligion. They call the Russians, Sare-Giaur, or Sare-Guebr, i. e. light brown idolaters ; probably be- 
cause they observe fewer persons with black hair among them, than among the people of Asia.

This, indeed, has ceased ; but they still endeavor, as they used to do, to prevent the women from ap- 
proaching the sacred fire ; probably, tliat their presence may not divert their attention. 

In every thing that surrounds them, these monks are very neat and cleanly. They have no su- 
perfluity, but poverty is unknown among them. Their cells are likewise lighted by the subterraneous 
fire; which is easily extinguished by covering the vent through which the gas issues. The verdure 
of the garden on the other side of the court-yard of the temple, and the delightful shade of the trees, 
afford these hermits a refreshing coolness. If superstition finds, in the evanescent flame, an object 
of adoration, no inconsiderable advantage is derived from the naplha, which is so common here, and 
in the neighborhood, and yields to the ciown an annual revenue of 200,000 rubles. 



FOR WHOM IS THE MEED OF THY LOVE? 



Sat, lady, for whom is the meed of thy love. 

And the glance of thy languid eyes. 
Where beameth the soul of the sinless dove 
Ever gazing, at evening's hour, above 
Oa those of thy kindred skies I 

Is it for him whose fearless flight 

Is over the rolling sea — 
Who smiles on the storm, and braves the fight. 
And seeks, thro' the gloom of the wild-sea night, 

No beacon of love but thee 1 

Or is it for him whose warrior plume 

Is dabbled with crimson brine, — 
Who, thro' prairie battle and forest gloom. 
Wins laurels of bright immortal bloom 

To lay on thy beauty's shrine 1 

Or for him who holds the high debate 

In the nation's council hall, — 
Who, grasping at power and glory and state. 
Feels, deeply feels, that, tho' good and great. 

Thy guerdon is worth them all 1 

Is it for him who meets disease 

By palace or road-side cot — 
Who leaves his chamber of classic ease 
That the sigh, and the care, and the reckless breeze 

Of the world should reach thee not 1 

Or for him, who, full of Isaiah's fire, 

Tells of a holier sphere, 
Where seraph and saint and golden lyre 
Awaken the sweet celestial choir 

Inviting thy spirit there 1 

Or for him, the bard, who, by moonlight, strung 

His harp on lake or lea. 
While echo replied, as beauty sung, 
But who found, 'mid the fair, the gay, the young. 

No kindUng theme but thee 1 

Thus sang a young crusader, when the stars 
Of evening shone like gems on beauty's brow. 
The spirit of the night, in magic wrapp'd. 
Folded her wings to listen to the lay ; 



[ While, phrenzied with enjoyment, echo sprung 
From moss-grov/n couch, and breathed the spell- 
around ! 

To Zion's land, to free Christ's sepulchre, 
That youth withmarshall'd Christendom repair'd. 
Passion of soldier-fame, th' emblazon'd pomp 
Of Europe's multitudinous chivalry : 
Th' escutcheon'd banners thro' the royal camps j- 
The rich caparisoned steeds andjgallant knigh4&amp;, 
With silken scarf, worn in fair ladye's bower ; 
The spirit-stirring trump ; the onward charge, 
And all the blazonry of Crusade war. 
But sent liis pilgrim spirit back again 
To warm Italia's land of song and love^ 
And gentle Isabel's rewarding smilci. 

Absence is but love's life to faithful hearts, 
Which, as the tie that links two parted doves&gt; 
Vigor derive from distance. But the joy 
She fel: ia hearing how the banner cross 
Was, by Vincenzio, wav'd from Zion's walls. 
Refused her soul to contemplate the deed 
And yet outlive the rapture. 

She expired! 
******* 

A war-worn figure droops o'er yonder grave, 
Where streamlets, murmuring, glide and willows' 

wave. 
It is Vincenzio ! not the cavalier 
Whose victor-shout burst on the Paynim's ear. 
Or turned his lute to love for Isabel 
On moonlight lake or in romantic dell. 
No, but Vincenzio of the tearful heart, 
To which no Hope sweet balsam can impart ; 
Nightly he seeks that grave-spot, cold and deep. 
Where Death and Beauty in dark wedlock sleep ; 
And all the warmth that urged the warrior's brow 
Dwells there, alas, in furrowing rain-clouds now. 
Thus teaching us that love's the only light 
To guide us thro' this sublunary night ; 
And hope, with beacon smile, to shine afar 
On worlds whose joys no earthly ills can mar — 
Bright, mystic, pure, celestial realms of soul. 
The sage's wonder and the christians's goal.

A TALE OF THE LATE AMERICAN WAR, 



chapteh I. 



THE COUSINS 



It was a soft evening in May, 1812, when Catharine Harman, a laJy of noble bearing, and iffl 
perial beauty, was stioUing in a grove of oaks that ornamented the grounds of a mansion on' the 
banks of the Chesapeake. Far beyond the share of the most favored was the lovehness of the lady, 
and the fairest of her sex in her charming presence, might have wondered at nature's partiahty. 
Apparently the showers of but eighteen springs had freshened the bloom of her beauty, yet the next 
evening her twentieth birth-day was to be commemorated at the noble mansion of her family. 
Fairer than all the lover dreams of paradise was the exquisite symmetry of her person. The outline- 
was swelling round, and softly undulating as if finished by angels from heaven's rarest models. At 
rest, the matchless proportions were health and beauty deified ; but in motion, best was their won- 
derful loveliness developed. And her walk had the imposing dignity of the high dama nurtured in 
the olden courts of lady-love and troubadour, combined with the elegant, the tripping simplicity of a 
Hebe. She stepped — oh ! she floated, joyous and inspired, as if to the voluptuous melody of an Ita- 
lian opera ; and as her elegant figure, traced so faint, yet so roundly full, in a rich close robe of the 
times, swept the long grass, noiseless as the sailing albatross, and wound among the whispering trees 
as a virgin cloud from the court of the moon, a painter might have sketched the portrait of a celes- 
tial huntress alighting in her groves. Her ankle and foot — for ah ! there is a dangerous coquetry 
in a pretty foot — small, and charmingly shaped — the indispensable of womanly beauty — were 
barely seen ere they vanished in their mysterious ambush, as if one glance were enough to enchant. 
Her face ! alas ! the artist's finest touch were even Apollo the artist, could not breathe its passicii, 
its divinity ; to look on it were to wither the heart, and give memory immortality. It was not the 
cherubic laughingness of the playful girl, but the matured, the superb, and fascinating loveliness of 
the woman. 

Her complexion was that happiest union of color, seen only in female cheeks and in the pei-fec?- 
tion of painting — the softest blending of the lily and the rose — yet it rivalled the fairest lily or the 
richest rose. Her head was of splendid mould, and hex forehead high and queenly. A few shoit 
curls clustered like the locust flowers on its ravishing fairness ; and waving masses of dark brown 
hair, straying in ringlets from under a jewelled clasp, flung their wild profusion over a neck of snow, 
and a bosom whose faultless contour rivalled the proudest creations of the Grecian chisel, in whicfi 
nothing of beauty or grace is unfinished. That glossy, voluptuous hair, was like the luxuriant sea- 
grass in the mermaid's bower, floating over, yet slyly showing its virgin pearls. 

The jetty eyebrow was pencilled with the rainbow's curve; her lashes were long, black, and ex- 
quisite ; and there was that thrilling and mystic depth of soul in her lustrous black eyes which the 
flower of nature's nobility only have. By turns they were soft as the houri's glance — by turns they 
flashed as the moonlit-rill, or beamed with the still enthusiasm of the stars. Truly the eye is the 
mirror of woman, for its reflection is mystery ; even in sleep it has a spell we dare not trust. 

The nose was strictly Grecian — that classic inheritance of so many fair claimants ; the sunny, 
oval cheek vvas a delicious repose of blushes ; and the round superb chin, when drawn proudly up, 
was slightly doubled. But her scarlet lip of scented ripeness — ah ! there was a witchery there that 
mocks the power of pen. Even anger cannot rob a woman's lip of its magic, for in its pout there rs 
death to the young heart. In jo3'ous love, it is a cradle of smiles tempting an impassioned caress — 
a fount of delicious nectar intoxicating to sip — or rather it is the honeyed altar of passionate love. 
But in offended pride and bridling beauty, how ravishing its toss, its quiver ! The lips of the dan- 
gerous Catharine Harman wore the softest smile, the rosiest pout, the proudest cuil, and in their ver- 
milion shadow were arrayed a set of teeth whiter than the foam of the sea. 

The expression of her countenance was difficult to define. In pensiveness, it was poetry in its 
richest garb ; in animation, it copied the wave of the laughing lake ; and, again, it wore that lofty some- 
thing, that hauteur perhaps, that springs from a noble and cultivated intellect ; but at times its.

wondrous meaning was as changeful and exhaustless as the picture of the cloud in the rippling 
spring. Her face was a gay masquerade of expression. 

A child of sorrow was this beautiful being — amiable as she was lovely, yet unfathomable in a 
passing acquaintance. Outwardly lively and dashing, she was one of that strange few who, when 
they list, can stand calm, dark, and unread under the scrutiny of the world, 

Grief has been said to exert a chastening influence, but some'imes it nurtures dangerous predis- 
positions — but of this again. At the age of fifteen, Catharine Harman had lost a sainted mother. 
Two years after, an only brother, led by that fever of travel and adventure so seducing to youth, had 
left his home, and been killed in a duel in a distant state. His blooming sister was left with but two 
relatives on earth — a passionate indulgent old father, and a portionless male cousin, two years her 
junior, who was avi-ay at college. 

The fair Kate Harman h id been brought up a pretty pet, which is to say that she was self-willed, 
though, like many pets, her heart was in the right place. The rose that flowers in a garden of 
weeds is the sweeter by contrast, for it is at once associated with some inherent excellence which 
defied neglect. So with the happy pet, whose innate goodness cannot be spoiled by parental indul- 
gence. By natural consequence of her rearing, Catharine was somewhat of a coquette. Start not ! 
nor cross thyself, guileless reader, for thou art generous, and coquettes are a much abused race. 
What a brilliant world of song and loveliness, of sighs and smiles, of tears and thrilling tones, of wild 
reproach, sweet repentance, and eloquent sorrow arc embodied in that single name of coquette ! At 
once the delighted fancy pictures a superb and accomplished female luxuriating in the " purple light 
of love." The very name implies beauty, talent, and amiability ; in that these alone win admiration, 
and by these only will gentlemen admit they are conquered. That wretched ambition, which pub- 
licly displays the peacock's feathers, is not the intoxicating play upon hearts of a beautiful and po- 
lished woman. The firat is the toy of vanity — the other, the innocent love of being loved — an evi- 
dence at once of overflowing kindness. This is the pleasing diflercnce between the painted flirt and 
the witching, glorious creature who coquettes from conscious nobleness — claiming homage as the 
prerogative of her heavenly nature. If her smile is a lure, (sure it is a pious fraud to lead mortals 
to heaven !) it honestly shows the gilded barb, and adoring man takes it with a rapture which 
breathes, " 'tis delicious to yield when angels tempt." Nothing in this world is half so harmless and 
unasking as love ; emotion so gentle and so gratuitous, cannot fiiil to awaken a regard in its object, 
thus bringing into play commendable exorcises of feehng. Females delight in the gentle charge of 
heartless coquette. 

Now, coquetry in a cottage proves at once that it is natural ; and, zounds ! who, in this christian 
age, will say that adored woman shall be rifled of her birthright 1 Rivalry is the soul of love, as 
jealousy is its test ; and tiie real lover of a dashing coquette feels a delicious uncertainty which 
teaches him truly to value her. He must be a happy man, who is loved by one of these captivating 
beings ; there must be — oh, there is — an intensity of devotion in the love that prefers him to the 
world of its choice. Vanity — than which no feeling is more slandered and more disinterested — 
shares the giddy triumph. To think that she is the queen of hearts, and he the queen's king ! Many 
may have heard the story of Oian al Bekar, who was the devil amongst women — a very prince of 
coquettes — and Zelirc, his queen. They reclined in a nuptial bower, and the prince whispered — 
" You are beautiful, Zelire, and love me ; I am happy, for all men envy me," and he kissed his de- 
lighted bride. " You love me, Oian," murmured she, "and I am happy, for all women envy me." 
Can a prospect of domestic felicity be more flattering 1 

To the belle in polished, or perhaps artificial society, coquetry is an armor of security — one of the 
acquired luxuries of society. Tears are a woman's weapons with her husband, sighs with her lover, 
but she must fight the cruel world with coquetry. There is less of the amiable weakness in the 
other sex, from lack of power ; for, alas, they all would if they could, and do as they can. Where, 
then, is the credit of good motives for its condemnation by gentlemen 1 Ladies seldom cast the 
charge on one another. 

Star-gazers may have seen before now a gay, innocent-looking cloud suddenly darken and shoot 
forth lightning which it seemed too gentle to have harbored. So it was sometimes with Catharine 
Harman, To look on her faultless face, one would have never thought it passion's throne, yet she 
had that flavor of prettiness called " temper." There is something " interesting," highly so, in the 
female of holy placidity of disposition — one whose spirit glides unruffled along the calm tide of the 
ocean of life, and floats into port without a gun or a flag. How sweet, how heavenly ! — yes, a little 
too much so for this world. That " interesting" is an equivocal compliment, at best. Give me the 
woman who has a leaven of mortality ; a spirited girl, who will bridle up and argue, for nothing is 
so surpassingly delightful as the making up of a lovers' quarrel. A lake, sheltered by mountains, is 
very pretty, and all that, in its sweet repose ; but w ho delights not more in the sea — the wild, ma- 
jestic, beautiful, and laughing sea — which also has its hours of bewitching rest 1 Oh ! the .spice of 
"variety ! 

Well, Catharine, in addition to the sin of coquetry, had tempei. Yet there was but one chord, 
waking but one tone, to but one touch. The untimely and mysterious end of her brother had 
wrought a perilous effect on her sensitive nature. Few feelings are so beautiful as a sister's love — 



THE PRIVATEER. 39 

trusting as the dove in kindness returned, and, like the dove, unmurmuring in neglect. Its influence 
is holy and lasting ; for kw brothers of amiable sisters are ever unkind to the sex. But this theme 
is for gifted pens. Catharine Harman had loved her brother Charles with an intensity equalled only 
by its return. At the restless age of eighteen he had left his paternal roof with a hard wrung con- 
sent, and the first news of his wanderings was that he had fallen in a duel at New Orleans. Mourn- 
ful is the grief for the wanderer whose eyes are closed by strangers' hands, for it has no consolation. 
It seems so hard to be robbed of the last look, the parting message, of those who are dear. Had 
his sister drunk his last sigh, and planted the willow on his youthful grave, tears had been a luxury ; 
but as it was, memory had no farewell look or word to cheer its melancholy. The glad stream that 
has been dammed across, is slow and silent, yet at some time it will burst the barrier that gave it 
strength. As Catharine brooded over her brother's death, a new and powerful passion crept over 
her young heart — an unyielding abhorrence of duelling and duellists. This strong and absorbing 
feeling lit up disdain in her glance, and lent her tongue the withering eloquence of passion at the 
name or sight of a duellist. Each blighting sarcasm was an expiation to the shade of her brother. 
At such moments, how different was she from the winning Catharine, the courteous and animated 
belle ■? 

Gifted, accomplished, and wealthy ; at home in the graceful dance, or waking the melody of Eu- 
terpe from her harp ; the light of the gay saloon, and the toast of the private circle ; it was not won- 
derful that this brilliant favorite of nature should exercise the dangerous power of her inheritance. 
Many a conquered youth had knelt impassioned at the shrine of her beauty, and thought himself 
blessed with a tear of pity. The rich and powerful had courted her alliance ; but, with the air of 
an empress, she answered, " My liberty is dearer than thou." 

But the fair Kate has been walking all this time in the grove by herself. She neared the skirt 
of the wood that sloped to a grassy bank, and flung its image on the tide. Leaning on the trunk 
of an ample oak, while the leaves of a pendent bough were wooing her lips and ringlets, she put on 
a poetical face, and gazed musingly on the water. 

The scene was brilliant and beautiful. Mysteriously charming it is to trace the landscape's sha- 
dow pencilled bright as its copy in the waveless tide. Fair earth is a vain baggage, and delights to 
take a peep at herself, as some pretty school giil, who carries a mirror in her bosom to dress her 
ringlets by. There, curiously inverted in that glorious bay, stood every quiet tree and yellow cliff, 
the setting sun, the anchored clouds, and the bandit fish-hawk watching still by his naked nest. It 
was nature sketching her own portrait from her looking glass. Far from the shore, hung dizzily be- 
tween two heavens, sat a slight pilot schooner, raking true to her own weblike outline, on which she 
rested keel to keel. Here and there a stout bay craft was dozing on the crimson couch, and a thin 
column of smoke curled up amidships. At the distance of a mile, a gay looking ship, the palace of 
the cabin-king, appeared dotted with painted ports, and her sails and colors hanging sleeping in 
their pride. The sailor's favorite lay, " the girl I left behind me," wandered from the rigging to the 
shore, plaintive as an unheard farewell. Far down, a long low point stole away into the channel, 
with its sentinel lighthouse stark at the end; and, beyond, the blue Chesapeake rolled his funeral 
tide till sky and sea were blended in the enchantment of distance. Around the embowered man- 
sion a profusion of trees flung the mingled shade of the classic elm, the collonaded poplar, the whis- 
pering locust, and the lordly oak. Rows of white outhouses glanced among the foliage ; and, around 
the neat negro quarters, troops of noisy young " tow heads" were gamboling with dogs of all de- 
grees. Near by, an orchard of choice and various fruit was sending an odorous tribute to the sky ; 
and a spacious garden on the southern wing, with its jetting fount, its silver rill, and vine-clad bow- 
er, its winding walks, and delicious shrubbery, spoke the culture of a refined and finished taste. 
From a flowering lawn to the bay, there stretched a beautiful grove of oaks, the play ground of a 
pair of fawns, and the favorite stroll of their lovely mistress. It was a striking and animated picture 
,of southern comfort and elegance. Over all, the setting sun brushed his burnished mantle, for he is 
a rare and skilful artist. The exquisite blending of ray and shade, the light in gay reUef, and the 
mystic tints of the far blue hills, are each and all his patent of matchless artistry. 

That flow of soft delight which lovely scenery awakens in the gifted mind, stole over the lady as 
the floating serenade of the lute, and she murmured, " it is beautiful." 

" The scene," answered a low and melodious voice, " is insipid, for beauty is by comparison. An 
angel is an angel only on earth, in heaven she is but a woman. This scene is dull, for its charms 
have fled to deck a fairer shrine. Nature is jealous of you, peerless Catharine, as your music master 
was when his fair pupil excelled him." 

A graceful foim of rounded eighteen was bending before her, and a sad and handsome face beamed 
upon the startled lady. She knew him not, and the stranger enjoyed her confusion with silent va- 
nity — for there is a singular delight in the incognito of one returning among his friends after an ab- 
sence of years. No youth, especially at such a time, can bear to be saluted with familiar recogni- 
tion. That careless " how are you] why you have not changed much," is chilling enough to the 
fancied unknown. A stare and a distant bow are the most subtle flattery- — for vanity reads in them 
a change of personal appearance — for the better of course. Thus it may have been in the present

instance, and the youth looked at Catharine, as she thought, with provoking impudence — but then 
he was so handsome I 

"And I," again spoke the stranger, folding his aims, and bowing his head in eloquent melancho- 
ly, "have mused for years on that only balm of absence, remembrance of the loved, to find that I 
am forgotten. Would for his peace that Walter de Berrian were blessed with his cousin's forgetful- 
ness." 

" Walter, Walter ! my own dear cousin, I did not know you," exclaimed Catharine, quite taken 
by delightful surprife, as she extended her hand, and almost herself. In another moment she re- 
tired, sweetly confused, before the trembling and grateful gaze of the youth. iiThe easy belle was 
abashed, and theie was mischief in her soft confusion. The young man at her side was an orphan, 
tinder the guardianship of her father. Four yeais ago he left for college, a bashful stripling, whom 
his wild romping cousin had often kissed just to see him blush. She had read his letters, breathing 
a poetry of feeling which she could scarcely realize from the pen of the retiiing Walter. But Catha- 
line was flashing on her career of beauty and triumph, and seldom thought of her absent cousin, un- 
less with a wonder of ideal interest. He stood beside her now an elegant gentleman, with thought 
upon his brow, and soul in his sad black eye — her equal in knowledge and mind — for a moment the 
change embarrassed her. 

" Your hand only !" ejaculated the young De Berrian, in strangely musical tone, as the blushing 
lady drew back. " This is a cold meeting — a slander to our heart. Why, my cousin, if wc art glad 
to meet, should our joy be locked in this unmeaning shake? Why not lake counsel of our feelingsl" 

" I do," she answered, with a pretty curtesy. 

" We did not meet so once, Catharine, nor is this the greeting of kindred spirits — excuse me for 
complimenting myself." 

" Oh sir, since you are so disinterested, you are welcome to my share of the compliment. But 
•what of our meetings oncel I have'nt any memory ; you know when I used to climb that cliffyon- 
der for the flowers on its brink, while you were praying me to come down, I never looked behind, 
it made me giddy." 

"Ah it is true of all conquerors that they drown the cries of the wounded in the music of victory. 
But I meant, dearest cousin, that our hands formerly met after our lips — thinking they were safe in 
so innocent an example," returned Walter doubtfully. 

" Why then,'' answered the laughing belle, " you were a sly pretty boy, and I, a little woman, 
for I had already broken some dozen of hearts, and worn as many miniatures. But now you have 
grown so tall and handsome, with such meaning in your eyes — I — you would not have your cousin 
kiss a man"!" 

"No, loveliest girl! Never may that monster of beard and brutality wound my cousin's cherry 
lips. Reserve their dew and breath for the caress of thy softer sex and the warm touch of adoring 
boyhood. I am just eighteen," and, as the pleasing Walter spoke, his arm warily circled the round 
waist of the half-willing Catharine, and, amid slaps and stifled screams, he sought her averted lips. 
After a tantalizing chase, he snatched a lily hand from over the blushing fugitives, and printed upon 
them a long, delicious kiss. 

"How da:e you sir?" demanded Catharine, drawing up her pretty chin. 

"I am dying — my Ufe is the forfeit of my rashness." 

" See what you have made of my hair, you impudent boy !" she said with a fatal glance, as she 
shook out the disordered tresses. 

The youth stood as if he had suddenly waked in the bower of a Peri : and well might the exqui- 
site being before him have brought in question the reality of sight. The rich blood was planting 
roses in her superb cheeks, and through the splendid curls, that showered over hex face, he saw a 
pouting lip and a witching eye. 

" Saint Mary !" whispered De Berrian, as if he feared to frighten the vision, "what crime, fairest 
exile, did you commit in Heaven ?" 

" Theft sir," she returned with a penitent sigh. "It is my only fault; I stole Cupid's arrows." 

" Then it is no mystery that they never wound yourself," said Walter, recovering his mortality. 
" Fatal hirntress ! now that the stolen quiver is nearly empty, in that you have more heaux than ar- 
rows, you kill with the more deadly artillery of your eyes. Such is the boasted progress of refinement. 
Yet spare a triumph so poor as I ! Fire not from that murderous ambush again. The next glance 
■will read the treasured secret of years," and his head fell mournfully upon his bosom. 

" Oh ! is there a casket there that will hold a secret so long ? Give it to me, my own kind cou- 
sin, and I won't look death at you again," and she leaned imploringly on his arm. 

" It is yours, my adored Catharine," he murmured low and passionately, " I love you." 
" Love me ! I hope you do: I would not have a cousin that did not love me," She looked the 
sweetest surprise, and turned a demure face to the perplexed youth. 

"Roguish counterfeit, and ridiculous me !" thought he, "I must pretend innocence too. The 
surest lure for a butterfly is a painted rose." De Berrian had read much, seen much, and thought 
more. His fancy was rich, and his conversational powers of the first order. He adverted to the 
beautiful scenery aroimd them, and, insensibly, Catharine was drawn from her perfection of sim-

plicity. Her gifted cousin was spieading a rare repast with a tasteful hand, and she partook with 
kindred enthusiasm. They descanted on the "beauties of nature," "painting," and " music," and 
wept over "poetry" and tlie "jp thetics." The cousins were shining in a new and dazzling hght. 
They were surprised at the extent of their powers, delighted with themselves, and with each other. 
Love, in the natural order of events, was the next theme, and they both seemed awaie of the law,, 
for Walter was trembling, and playing with hu unsuspecting little hand, and Catharine gave her 
head the ndke droop to one side, and looked delightfully simple, 

" To me," said Walter with a speculative air, " it is inscrutable that actions and feelings should 
contradict each other. In this I am unblest, for my tongue is the confidant of my heart, which, as 
with your sex, means, that it keeps secrets by calling in assistance. Now, m.y cousin, I love you — 
see how my tongue betrays its faith — do you love me.^" 

" Why what do you take me for, Walter 1 Do not the laws of Lsaven and earth command us to 
love our relatives]" 

" Why will you not understand mel" he asked, with a passionate vehemence. " My love, beau- 
tiful woman, is not that calm, unanxious instinct of kindred. (Dh ! it is the freshest dew of the soul 
falling on its favorite rose ! Catharine, we were children together, and the youngest tendril of the 
vine circles the nearest flower, and it never loosens its clasp for another." 

" Beautiful," she interrupted, with enthusiasm ; " but the vine grows, puts forth other tendrils, andr 
the youngest is first to decay, while the poor flower has long since perished in its withering clasp. 
Heaven save this frail flower from such keeping !" 

" They died faithfully together — an emblem " 

" But I don't want to die, dear, I'll tell you, skeptic — I named a wreath of flowers, " love," and 
threw it on the stream of isles in our garden. It floated gayly on, coquetting with every wave and 
bough, lingering a while on the golden sands of a flowered islet, and gliding away with a promise 
to come back A fairer spot was ever in view — some far sweet isle, in the majesty of distance, 
wi'ched the loitering voyager along, till the poor withered thing of vanity was stranded on a bub- 
ble. First love may be sincere while it lasts, but the same beauties of person and mind, by the 
same impulse, will charm in another. Absence conqueis love by love's own weapons." 

"Thank you, sweet coz, for the lesson you leach; for, since my idol is the fairest and best, my 
faith will never be tempted." 

" Mine is not equally guarded," she rejoined laughing, " or rather I never loved. I don't believe 
in that lisping romance of the nursery. I have frailties enough." 

" Frailties!" said De Berrian shoitly." I cannot understand that senseless afTectation which can 
name the noblest passion in the gift of heaven a frailty. Yet listen, Catharine," he softened as he 
lip put on its haughtiness, " I know that you are kind and gentle as your fawns, for the child ne^ 
ver forgets the playmate of his cradle. Your bosom thrills with sympathy at the tale of sorrow, and 
that liquid eye is lit with heaven's light when virtue triumphs. Surely love would sue to nestle in 
a heart like yours. Ah! there is a remembrance, sweet with the fragiance of other years, which 
bids me speak. Here, under these trees, we have woven the blue hare-bells together, and you have 
sportingly kissed me ! O then, even then, I could have held your soft sweet lips to mine, and wished 
that moment eternity. Then I learned to adore you, and if there is one feeling unmixed with self, 
one trait that hallows frailty, it is the delicious love of early years, which blooms and smiles when 
the head is white, and the eye rayless. From birth my nature named you happiness, my honor was 
woven with you as glory, and my young ambition saw in you its heaven. Mine is the love that 
loves but once, and mine I offer thee." 

" Thank you," answered the beauty, in a rapture of modesty. " How proud I am of my cousin— 
so eloquent, so tender. I am in torment to show my triumph." 

" Is this your answer 1" demanded Walter, hastily, 

" What is the question, sir 1" 

" Do you love me 1" 

" That's not fair," she returned, sweetly ; " do you love we?" 

" Oh ! devotedly, my first and fairest," and he caught her hand, 

" Not so fast," she exclaimed, pretending surprise ; " the first flowers of spring are fairest and 
frailest, too. Your ofl'er is painful and unexpected ; speak of it no more." 

Yet Catharine felt proud, gratified at his long cherished aflfection, which, as a romping, teazin^ 
girl, she had slyly seen in a thousand adoring looks and silent rambles. As a lovely and winning 
belle, there lingered amid all her giddy triumphs a tender interest for her pensive cousin. His love 
she felt was a feeling tribute to her worth, and then he was a proud and portionless orphan. But 
it would never do that the hunted coquette should be won so easily. She would not admit to her- 
self that she loved him ; yet, as she stole a look at his faultless figure and handsome face, eloquent 
with vexation and disappointment, something whispered—" If ever I should love, my noble cousia 
will be the happy raa.n," 

To be eontinued.J 



THEY CALL ME COLD AND PASSIONLESS 



Thet call me cold and passionless — ah ! little do they know 
How deep and strong the cuirenl is that silently doth flow ; 
The babbling brook and rivulet in noisy murmurs plash, 
And loud the mountain torrent's heard from rocky height to dash ; 
But plainly are the pebbles seen those streamlets murmur o'er, 
And soon is dried the rocky bed whence broke that torrent's roar. 

But give to me — for unison itholdeth with my soul — 

The rivei's calm and noiseless, yet never ceasing roll ; 

The proudly firm and onward pour of waters on their course, 

Alike unchecked by luring smiles, as unrestrained by force, 

That kisses now the flovv'ery bank, the drooping willow steeps, 

Unchanged then past the castle's base, through frowning ravine sweeps. 

They call me cold and passionless — ah ! little can they tell 
Beneath the mountain's cheerless side how many a spring may well, 
Whose sweet refreshing waters, found by some divining rod. 
Gush up to cool the parched brow, make glad the valley sod 
Give nurture to the wa\ing grove, and blooming fragrance spread 
Aiound the path that beauty loves at even tide to tread. 

How many a flower of loveliness by nature's left alone, 

To add its sweetness to the air, from yonder cliff's high throne ; 

How many a gem of brilliancy, new lustre that would give 

To kingly crown or diadem, in cavern dim doth live, 

And waiteth but to answer back the torch's intruding ray, 

Or flash and sparkle in the full and glowing blaze of day. 

They call me cold and passionless — because I will not bow 

At beauty's shrine the stubborn knee, nor veil the careless brow ; 

Because my heart no altar is, whereon to sacrifice 

To every lip where wreathed in smiles a subtle Cupid Ues, 

To every eye from which may gleam a passion-kindled glance. 

To every form that gi-aceful floats adown the mazy dance. 

Yet can I worship Woman with intensity of one 

Who feels her power, and boweth as the heathen to the sun — 

Who knows that life would be a cold, a dark and dreary night, 

But that her smiles are round him warm — her presence ever bright; — 

Who feels his soul would be like some unstrung and silent lyre, 

Did not her breath awake its tones and every note inspire. 

They call me cold and passionless — because they cannot read 

In every changing lineament the foreshade of each deed ; 

Because the burning feelings that my inmost bosom fill — 

The thoughts that glow within my breast, in every heart gush thrill — 

Do not, in outward form and look, their secrets stern enrol. 

While he that runneth by may read — a light emblazoned scroll. 

And yet my soul resembles oft some cavern hidden deep 
Beneath the calm and careless earth, where pent up thundefs leap, 
Where passion's bubbling lava boils and hisses in its rage. 
Where lightnings whirl in fearful dance, and fires volcanic wage 
A fretful war against the chains too firmly that do bind. 

And hold their chafing elements obedient to the mind ! E. Gt K.

ROMANCE OF AMERICAN HISTORY 



BT VARIOUS ATTHORS. 



PONTIAC, THE OTTAWA 

AN INDIAN TALE. 



MILTOX SAIfBERS. 



CHAPTER I. 

" CuESE the pale faces !" exclaimed a tall Indian who stood upon a ledge of rocks which jutted 
over a dark ravine, down which the mountain current whirled with the rapidity of an arrow, sound- 
ing like the deep and dull rumbling of distant thunder, and throwing up the spray in hazy wreaths 
which almost reached the ledge upon which the Indians stood. 

" Curse the pale faces ! dost thou think I can be subdued by the cubs whose dams I prostrated 
at my feet !" He who spoke was a tall Indian of a herculean mould, with a high and expansive 
forehead, and a pair of dark eyes, which glistened like the mountam tiger's as he spoke. His fea- 
tures were sharp and sternly set, while his shaggy eyebrows were natm-ally drawn down over his 
eyes, which gave to his features an ascetic expression not very prepossessing. The Indian to whom 
he addressed the expression, was a small man, with a narrow receding forehead, dark fieiy eyes, and 
a countenance the unnatural distortions of which, when he spoke, would lead a physiognomist into 
the mdubitable belief that this delectable individual might be one of that number whose qualms of 
conscience for evil deeds might be too frequent. The large Indian gritted his teeth as he finished 
speaking, and brandished his tomahawk towards fort Duquesne with a fearful vigor, which, with the 
dark scowl upon his face, caused the smaller Indian to recoil with fear. 

" 'Tis even so," at length spoke the latter, in a dry guttural voice. " The cubs have grown in 
strength, till they have risen to sweep us from the earth ; already have they encroached into our 
hunting grounds, and om- game is daily becoming less beneath their fiery weapons." 

" Let them grow ! the taller the tree grows, the easier 'tis blown dowTi by the wind," said 
Pontiac, (for it was he,) who gazed so intently in the direction of fort Duquesne, as not to observe 
the countenance of the dwarf Pishairo, which assumed a sinister smile, while his small bright eyes 
glittered like the enraged snake when he watches in the grass for his prey. " 'Tis said the pale war- 
rior would wed the daughter of Pontiac ; has the news yet reached the ear of ovur sachem 1" 

" The sachem glared upon the dwarf as if he wonld fathom his inmost thoughts, while the 
bitter smile which had spread over his features suddenly passed off, and a demure composure was 
the only expression observable. " Hast thou been among the pale faces contrary to my wishes 1 if 
so, better hadst thou be a snake than Pishairo," said the chief sternly through his clenched teeth, as 
he continued gazing upon the countenance of the dwarf. " Speak ! how comest thou by this idle 
talk, which would better become one of thy own kind than me V 

" I have sought thee, Pontiac, for my breast is burdened with news. Listen ! As the sun was 
sinking behind the mountain, and ere the birds had ceased their warbling, I beheld the pale face in 
his canoe, which he plied silently, scarcely disturbing the dark shadows in the waters as he passed ; 
he landed, and with the stealthiness of the wild cat, when he crawls upon his prey, mounted he the 
green bank which rises by thy mountain wigwam ; he gained the top — a low cry, and thy dark-eyed 
daughter " 

The fierce sachem sprang upon his feet, and fixing his fiery eyes upon the dwarf, drew back 



44 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

his long spear, as if in tHe act of hurling it, while the informant crouched clo^r to th rock beneath 
which he sat. 

" When the Ottawa sachem discovers Pishairo's tongue forked lUie the subtle snake's, then let 
him strike the base blood from his heart," and the dwarf laid his hand upon his bosom, and gazed 
steadfastly upon the chief, who, after scrutinizmg his countenance, which was as expressionless as 
the cold marble, exclaimed in a voice of passion, " None of the pure blood of Pontiac shall mingle 
with the base blood of the pale face, unless it be in the struggle for life and death. I have said it ! 
Curse the white race ! Were I the father of a thousand daughters, whose eyes were as dark as the 
night, and whose hair were as beautiful as the raven's plumage, I would lay them all upon the dust 
and mingle their blood with the dirt ere it should mingle with that cursed race ! I will stand in 
their path, and stop their journey, or, upon the bones of my forefathers, perish," and the chief shook 
his spear with vehemence towards the dwarf. 

" These were words of truth," assented the small man, who still lay close to the rock, 

" Pishairo speak," said the sachem in a peremptory tone, which was not to be disobeyed. 

"The daughter of the Ottawa sachem gazed into the eyes of the pale face with those of the dove, 
and her voice was as soft as the nightingale when he sings to his love, as she whispered in a low 
voice, which reached my ear,' Thy canoe did not darken the waters last setting sun ; no ripple came 
to the shore from thy paddle; has the daughter of the Ottawa sachem grown cold in thine eye 1' 
Then spoke the pale faced chief, and his voice was like unto the silvery tones of the dark-eyed maiden, 
' The pale face loves the Ottawa maiden, but not for her lands — 'tis the maiden he wants, and he 
•would take her from this dreary forest to the bright land of his people— would the red maiden fol- 
low her pale lover 1' and he placed around her neck a chain made from the bright metal, as he drank 
from her glowing eyes the confession that she would be his own. In a mellow voice he bade her 
meet him at the next setting sun, and then his canoe went its noiseless way and soon disappeared ; 
these are not forked words." 

The eyes of the chief flashed fire, he gritted his teeth, and clenched his spear with the power of 
a vice, but, with that tact peculiar to him, covered the fury which raged within him under features 
which indicated nothing more to an observer than their usual stern and determined expression. He 
strode off, and the features of the dwarf again assumed their usual cunning and sinister expression. 
The haughty Ottawa sachem had beheld with a jealous eye the daily encroachments of the white 
race upon the lands owned by his tribe. His foresight told him that the power which a while pre- 
viously was unlimited among the tribes, was daily becoming weaker — and he already viewed, in an- 
ticipation, the whites as masters of the land of his ancestors, unless he adopted vigorous measures to 
drive them from it ere they increased to such numbers as would render futile all his attempts to ex- 
pel them. Already had his name ceased to create that electric effect which it was wont ere the 
whites came to the country, and he determined, with one sanguinary blow, to regain that mighty 
influence which he had lost. He was determined that his voice should again be heard with rever- 
ence at the council fire, and that, v\hen in his absence, his belt should summon a host of warriors 
to his standard, as it formerly did in the days of his glory. It is seldom we see one possessing power 
once, when levelled to the common standard of a private individual, who is willing to remain so ; 
but with the never-tiring and never-quietted passion ci'iilidon continually spurring him on, he is 
never satisfied, never at ease, but unceasingly engaged in plotting and counterplotting for the prize 
which can never be reached, till at last he expires, a victim to the passion which bums alike in the 
breast of the savage and the king. 

Pontiac still possessed unlimited sway over his own nation — yet the influence of the whites was 
also felt among his own tribe ; they did not obey his wishes with the same alacrity as previous to 
the appearance of the whites on their soil. The dwarf, who belonged to the Peoria nation, whom 
the warlike Ottawas had conquered and reduced to slavery, was a soi-disant chief: but the fate of 
war had not only reduced him to a private individual, but also to a slave, in which capacity he 
served under the Ottawa sachem ; which, after all, was more compatible with his talent than his for- 
mer station, which was an hereditary gift. Love and jealousy are passions which rage in a savage 
with more energy than in a refined bieast, and these were at this time the two predominant passions 
of Pishairo. He had seen Pontiac's beautiful daughter, and to see was to love; he had gazed upon 
her till he was intoxicated with her charms ; long and ardently had he watched her expanding wo- 
manhood, and, like the rose bud, so beautiful at first, now that she had expanded to maturity, ap- 
peared more lovely still. This amiable lover had beheld the meeting of the preceding evening, and 
inflamed wiih jealousy, he sought the chief, whose irritable disposition he knew could be easily 
fanned into a flame, particularly when the subject was the white aggressors. His object for com- 
municating this intelligence was the reverse of what the chief supposed it, who imagined he had 
Mad the countenance of the dwarf. 



PONTIAC, THE OTTAWA. 45 

CHAPTER II. 

As the trees were gilded with the last rays of the declining sun, a canoe silently glided towards 
the bank upon which stood the wigwam of the Ottawa chief. The person who sat in it, and noise- 
lessly plied the paddle, appeared to be aware of his proximity to the hunting ground of the Ottawas, 
by the many anxious looks which he directed to every tangled coppice which he passed. After re- 
viewing well the woods from the middle of the stream, he turned the prow towards the shore, and 
with one or two dips of his paddle, the canoe bounded to the land ; he sprang out, and drawing it 
farther upon the bank, stealthily walked up the hill, observing to examine the priming of his pis- 
tols, which he carried in his belt, previous to commencing the ascent. He gained the top, and 
■whistling softly, beheld the Ottawa maiden advancing from the direction of her father's wigwam. 
At this moment an Indian stepped from behind a tree near the white man. 

" Ah, Pishairo, thou art here agreeably to thy promise," exclaimed the white man, as he grasped 
the Indian's hand, " and thou hast talked with the sachem's daughter — how can I reward thee 1" 

" Reward !" exclaimed the dwarf, as his features assumed the sardonic expression peculiar to 
them when he was over excited. " Thinkest thou a Peoria sachem asks reward 1 he takes it." 

" This language is enigmatical ; explain thyself, warrior," said the white man, whose face slightly 
reddened. " How couldst thou take thy reward unless I chose to give it ?" 

The dwarf burst out into a hysterical laugh. " Does the eagle ask the hawk for his prey "? No ! 
he pounces upon him and takes him" — and the dwarf walked off laughing immoderately. 

The white man gazed after him, but the Indian maiden was in his arms ere he could give vent 
to an expression of anger. He impiinted a kiss on her forehead, and his eyes immediately lost their 
expression of angei with which he gazed at the dwarf. 

" Is the Ottawa maiden ready to go to the land of the white man's people 1" 
The girl hung her head, and then looking him in the face with eyes beaming love, she answered, 
" The Ottawa maiden is ready to leave her people, and follow her white warrior to his bright land." 

" Then we will hasten ere '' and turning around, the white man beheld himself surrounded 

with Indians, who stood as many as the trees. He seized the maiden with the left hand, and with his 
light drew a pistol, which he discharged at the nearest Indian ; they rushed on him, but with his 
knife, which he brandished in the air with herculean strength, he kept the wairiors at bay, and 
slowly retreated towards the boat ; thiice did they rush up, and thrice did he repel them ; but finally 
he was overpowered by the savages, thrown upon the ground, and bound. The maiden was led to 
her lodge, and the while man borne to the densest part of the woods, where were erected the tents 
of the warriors. He was taken to a spacious tent, in which sat Pontiac and all of his oldest chiefs. 
A low guttmal interjection from each man as he passed, indicated their knowledge of his capture ; 
and then all were as silent and motionless as statues. The sachem motioned with his hand, and 
the white man was untied, and stood amongst them. The chief arose to address him, and from a 
spark of joy which appeared to twinkle in his eyes, it was evident he was striving to master feelings 
of exultation, which were so intense as almost to overcome him. The white man folded his 
arms, and looked steadfastly in the eyes of Pontiac as he spoke ; and from the fearless man- 
ner in which he bore himself, it was evident that he could be no uncommon person. The 'sa- 
chem spoke slowly and distinctly, and his words embodied that sarcasm which strikes to the soul of 
the addressed. 

" White man, listen ! The red man and the white man were friends ; they sat at the same coun- 
cil fire, and they slept upon the same blanket ; they walked the same path, and they smoked to- 
gether the same pipe ; they ate of the same venison, and there was peace ! White man, listen ! Ye 
grew in strength, (for then ye were weak) till, like the tall oak, ye fain would spread youi branches 
over the other trees, to guard them from the stoim ; ye are now grown high, but beware ! — none 
but the tallest trees are stricken by the fire of the clouds. (Every warrior grunted a commendation.) 
Ye grew in strength till the land which you hunted upon grew small in your eyes, and then ye 
would have ours. Ye taught our young warriors to drink the fire water, which drove them mad, and 
they were no longer warriors. Is this all ■? No ! Not content with oui lands, ye would steal upon 
our hunting grounds to carry off our daughter; what does the paleface merit?" The sachem's 
eyes twinkled like two stars as he gazed around upon the rows of warriors. 

" Curse the wild cat ! he would prey upon his red brothers," said a clear eyed old warrior, whose 
scalp lock was blanched with years. 

" And merits burning at the stake," said another, whose loclis were no less white. 
"And his bones cast to the dogs — curse him!" exclaimed a third. 

" Curse him !'' reiterated the rest in a low tone, as they involuntarily tightened their grasps 
around their tomahawk handles — " can the white chief find his tongue 1" 

The prisoner already knew of the mighty scheme against the whites which the sachem wag pro- 
jecting by his dutiful slave Pishairo, and he felt that his only chance for life would be to obtain, if 
possible, a protraction of his execution. He spoke firmly and frankly, and admitted what they aU 
leady suspected. There was no cringing beneath the stern and steady gaze of Pontiac, but he threw 



46 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

it back by one equally stern and defying ; he spoke with powerful energy, for he was pleading for 
life; he described in glowing colors the impression the first sight of his daughter had upon him, and 
that he was resolved to wed her in order to cement the bonds of friendship firmer between the white 
and red men, 

A demoniacal smile spread over the features of the sachem when the white man had finished speak- 
ing ; he drew himself up to his full height, and fiercely demanded the war club — should be passed 
around, which was soon done, and it was decided that the prisoner should be burned at the stake the 
following morning. He was taken to a wigwam and firmly bound, and four lynx-eyed warriors 
were stationed over him, who had mingled their blood, and swore to take the life of any one of 
their number who should be so unfortunate as to fall asleep. 

The prisoner was the young commander of Fort Duquesne, who had a short time previous left 
his native country, buoyant with hope, but in an unlucky moment beheld the pretty Indian maid- 
en, whose native charms captivated him. None of the Indians were aware of the rank of their pri- 
soner save Pontiac, and a very few of the veteran chiefs and warriors, who were all anxious for his 
death, more that the news might intimidate the soldiers of the fort, than for the heinousness of the 
crime of striving to steal a girl. 

About midnight, a messenger stood before the lodge of Pishairo, who was tossing about on his 
blanket, a prey to the burning thoughts which tortured his brain. The Indian tore away the rude 
screen from before the place of entrance, and bade the dwarf arise and proceed to the council house, 
whither he repaired instantly. Pontiac sat at the farther end of the house, and at each side of him 
four chiefs, whose hair were snowy with age, and like all grave counsellors, when on duty, they sat 
stem and motionless, with the exception of their lips, which slightly moved as the smoke from them 
curled in thick wreaths over their heads. 

"Pishairo!" The dwarf stood motionless, in a listening attitude. 

" Pishairo has his ears sharpened," said he, in a firm tone. 

" Listen," said the sachem ; " travel with the wings of the dove to fort Duquesne, and bear its 
commanding chief this belt ; look upon it ! 'tis a broad one ! the wampum is red. It speaks of 
war ! Tell him the red men would have him leave his fort, and march his men from our soil ere to- 
morrow's sun climbs the sky, or their great chief, who is our prisoner, shall be burned at the stake. 
Listen ! tell him the red warriors await his answer, in numbers as many as the leaves upon the 
trees — hasten." 

The aged chiefs granted an assent ; the dvrarf received the belt and departed. Ere he had pro- 
ceeded half a mile, a messenger overtook him, with orders from the sapient council to return. The 
dwaif measured the distance to the council house, and then turned back, and his eyes assumed a 
diabolical expression, and his eyes rolled with rage. The chiefs still occupied their seats, and ap- 
peared to take no farther notice of his return than by puffing larger volumes of smoke from their 
lips. Pontiac fixed his eyes upon the dwarf's countenance, and the gaze appeared to read the in- 
most thoughts which worked so wildly and energetically in his breast ; his own countenance was 
as unmoved and expressionless as if he slept. 

" Will the panther degrade himself and be a fox 1" at length the sachem thundered out. 

The dwarf laid his hand on his heart, and then throwing out his arms, exclaimed, " If the Ottawa 
sachem thinks the panther could be a fox, let him treat him as one." 

" Fidehty lurks not in the fox, yet it is with the Peoria warrior, said an old counsellor. 

" Methinks Pishairo is no snake," grumbled another. 

A writhing smile played upon the sachem's face, as he respectfully nodded to the old men who 
spoke, and bade the dwarf depart, nor tarry on his way. 



CHAPTER III. 

By day-break next morning, the warriors of the surrounding tribes poured in from all directions, 
till the woods were filled with them. The large council house was occupied by the old men, while 
the young warriors went through their war dance, and excited each other's passions with songs of 
the white aggressors, and tales of their own chivalrous feats. At the council, the Ottawa sachem 
exerted his talents with the most skilful success. With a profound knowledge of the character of 
the members of the several tribes who sat before him, he spoke words which, to them, were as fire ; 
nothing was left unsaid to arouse their passions against the whites. With oratorical powers, which 
could not be commanded by a white man, and an energy of gesture, which was natural, he painted 
in vivid colors to their imaginations, the usurpations of the white race since their arrival on the soil; 
how they had taken possession of their hunting grounds, and destroyed their game, and finally tried 
to steal away their children to make them slaves. He appealed to their prejudices and to their pas- 
sions ; and to render them more sanguine of success, promised them the assistance of the Great 
Spirit, who, he said, had visited him in a dream, and declared he would assist their cause, which was 
the holy one of freedom. The old waniors grasped their weapons, and, with suppressed interjections 



PONTIAC, THE OTTAWA. 47 

of rage, shook them in the air. During this excitement a small man entered, and took his way 
through the rows of warriors, till he stood before the orator. It was Pishairo ; he bore on the point 
of a long pole the war belt which he had received of Pontiac the previous evening; it was stripped 
of all its wampum, and was bare ! The sachem snatched it from the pole, and held it before the ex- 
cited members of the council, while his countenance was distorted with passion. The effect was in- 
stantaneous; the whole council arose with one burst of rage, and rushed out of the door, followed 
by Pontiac, who tore the belt to a thousand pieces, as he strode after them. The young warriors 
deserted the painted pole around which they danced, and with a wild yell crowded forward at the 
heels of the host which rushed forward with the irresistible impetus of the mountain torrent. They 
arrived at the wigvi^am where the prisoner lay, which they tore to pieces, and unbinding him, they 
bore him to the stake amid the deafening yells of the young warriors, while hundreds crowded in 
with arms full of dry faggots. The white man tried to speak, but his voice wSs drowned amid the 
loud curses of his enemies, whose fists and spear handles w-ere as busy as their tongues. His clothes 
were instantly torn from him in rags, and his body was painted black ; a buffalo thong was tied 
around his neck, and fastened to the stake, leaving a line long enough for him to move freely. The 
faggots were piled around at the distance of six feet, and a warrior stood with a torch to light them, 
when a shrill cry was heard, and the daughter of Pontiac sprang over the dry wood, and threw her- 
self upon the breast of her lover, which she clung to as a drowning man to a straw. The warriors 
looked upon this sight, which was so suddenly and unexpectedly presented them, with astonish- 
ment ; but there was no gaze of pity mingled with those looks — no compassion for her distress ; 
they curled their lips with rage, which soon broke out in yells of impatience. Pontiac drew back a 
moment with surprise, and then, with the fury of a demon, he grasped his tomahawk, and rushed 
upon his daughter to dash out her brains, when his arm was caught by Pishairo, the violent and se- 
cret lover of the maiden. With a thundering exclamation of contempt, the sachem seized the dwarf, 
as if he had been the smallest infant, and hurled him far over the heads of the warriors. The In- 
dian sprang upon his feet, and stung with rage, rushed at Pontiac, whom he reached in time to sus- 
pend a second blow, when a famous chief of another tribe interfered, and saved the life of the 
maiden. She was torn from the prisoner, and borne back to her wigwam ; the faggots were fired, 
and the dreadful work commenced. At this moment, a discharge of rifles burst upon the astonished 
warriors, and many of them were laid low with the dead ; but the rest, v.ho were excited to phren- 
zy, fought like lions. Before the English could load their guns, the Indians, led by Pontiac, were 
among them with the dreadful tomaliawk, which they wielded with their usual force and success. 
The battle was now hand to hand, and each man was engaged in a struggle which was for life or 
death. During this time, the Indian maiden rushed through the burning faggots and cut the cord 
which bound her lover, who joined his people, nov/ losing ground beneath the desperation of the In- 
dians. Long and deadly was the contest, but finally the' whites were forced to give way before the 
fury of the savages. They retreated with tolerable order, under the example of their naked and 
blackened commander, who had lost none of his bi avery with his clothes. They regained their boats, 
and after striving once more to gain an advantage, without success, paddled ofl', followed by the 
curses of the warriors, whose rage was none appeased b}' being deprived of the consoling sight of a 
prisoner burnt at the stake. Pontiac mounted a log, and in a few moments succeeded in fanning 
their already excited passions to a furious flame, and then the whole savage host marched for Fort 
Duquesne, as the exciting war song, from a thousand voices, swelled upon the air. 



CHAPTER IV. 

Among the warriors was a Chippewa chief, named Minavana, gifted with a powerful eloquence, 
which, with an indomitable disposition, rendered him a formidable rival of the Ottawa sachem. The 
Chippewas were at that time the strongest, with the single exception of the Oltawas, of the tribes 
inhabiting that vast wilderness stretching between the lakes and the Ohio river. This chief beheld, 
with a jealous eye, the ascending influence of the Ottawa sachem, whose power he iinagined was on 
the ebb, and with all the secret intrigue which he possessed, caballed against Pontiac. But these 
intrigues did not escape the wily sachem's notice, who, by means of some of the Chippewa's own 
warriors, received daily information of the progress of his plots. 

The sun was high in the heavens, when the host of warriors reached a ravine, formed by a moun- 
tain torrent, which, for ages, had rolled down the path. Here they encamped for the night, and af- 
ter placing sentinels around the neighborhood of the camps, the Ottawa sachein took his spear, and 
strode up the mountain side. He went alone — there was no human being to whom he could com- 
municate his secret projects, for there was no red man whose mind appeared to him gigantic enough 
to share his ambitious schemes. He strode up the mountain, looking upon either side, as he held 
his spear ready to strike into any of the wild animals, which, at that time, inhabited the mountain- 
ous countries in great numbers. The sun was now sinking behind a bed of clouds at the far west_ 
the birds were singing their evening songs ; the wind was lulled to sleep, and even the stern sa'

chem's breast was influenced by the repose around him ; his fierce spirit was calmed, and as he sat 
on a high rock, overlooking the whole country, he reasoned dispassionately on the probable chance 
of his succeeding in his bold design of driving the whites from his country. " Then again," said he, 
" will I be the sole king of this broad and blooming hunting ground : there will be no white men to 
teach our warriors cowardice, nor to create dissatisfaction among our young men. All will be as it 
were in the olden times ere the pale faces visited our shores ; and when the sachem's runners were 
not treated with contempt." 'J'he sachem's voice sank lower, but he was so absorbed in his ambi- 
tious thoughts, as not to observe two individuals who stood upon a rock just above him. They 
gazed eagerly upon him, and then spoke earnebtly, but in a tone sufficiently low as not to reach the 
ear of the dreaded chief. The smaller warrior, who was the dwarf Pishairo, stealthily disappeared 
behind the rock ; the other, who was the Chippewa sachem Minavana, made a noise which attracted 
the attention of Pontiac, and then appeared to be looking in another direction, apparently uncon- 
scious of his proximity to the Ottawa. 

" The Chippewa sachem is a panther in the fight," said Pontiac, in a tone of commendation. 

The Chippewa turned around, and, apparently surprised, saluted the sachem Vv'ith dignity and 
marked respect. 

" Would the sapient Pontiac practice his spesr upoii the heart of the bloody panther ere he plants 
it in the white man's 1" said the Chippewa, with a deferential inclination of the head, as he strode 
to the rock upon which sat the Ottawa. " I have sought thee eagerly ; the pale face warriors are 
upon our grounds, and our young warriors pant for battle — they want Pontiac." 

The Ottawa sprang to his feet, and followed Minavana. They wound their way around huge 
rocks — now upon the edge of a frowning precipice, where one false step would hurl them to atoms, 
and then at the bottom, where rocks rose above them, like the towers of some tremendous castle ; 
but they trod their way with a precision which could not be learned but by one who had spent years 
among the mountains. They finally reached a deep ravine, half way to the encampment of the In- 
dian army. The rocks rose high on each side, leaving a space between them of but a few feet. The 
Ottawa walked some distance before, wholly occupied in anticipating the battle, in which he hoped 
to be a formidable participator; while walking, he heard a voice, and turning around, the Chippewa 
chief was no where to be seen ; but in the gloom of the evening, he beheld a party of his warriors, 
armed alone with knives; they slowly advanced, dispersing, apparently with a view of taking him 
alive. The Ottawa hurled his spear in the breast of one, and, with his war cry, attacked them witli 
a fury which was irresistible ; he broke through them, and leaving four of their number dead, bound- 
ed down the mountain side; a shrill yell before him, by its peculiar tone, informed him a Chippewa 
was near ; he drew his knife, aud bounded forward — the sachem Minavana stood before him, 

" Curse thy false heart, Chippewa, thou art a squaw !" and with one jump, they stood facing each 
other, their eyes gleaming hate, and their lips curled with the scorn with which they pretended to 
view each other. 

" Thou art but a little girl, Ottawa, when the Chippewa sachem stands before thee," and with 
these approbious epithets, they fought with fury. Their physical powers were well matched, but 
the dread in which the Chippewa held Pontiac, might have weakened his energies, and he appeared 
to quail beneath the glare of the Ottawa's eye ; but he fought with the desperation which his situ- 
ation required. They were now locked in each other's firm embrace, and, after writhing awhile, 
they fell from the rock upon which they fought, upon a ledge a few feet below. They sprung upon 
their feet, and stood a moment to regain energy for their last struggle. They viewed each other 
with gestures of scorn. 

" The Ottawa squaw can't fight — his arms are too weak," panted the Chippewa in a contemp- 
tuous tone, while he knew he had been worsted in the scuffle. 

" The Chippewa is a fox, he is unworthy to live among warriors," oiied the other, and with 
drawn knives they again rushed' at each other ; and the Chippewa, who was the most excited by the 
other's taunting language, threw himself off his guard, and received the Ottawa's knife, which pene- 
trated to his heart. Pontiac tore from his head the scalp, and went his way to the camp. The war 
song rang upon his ear, and the young warriors were dancing around the painted war pole, while 
the old men had already assembled in the council house, and with impatience awaited the presence 
of their sachems. Pontiac entered with the reeking scalp of Minavana in his hand ; he took his sta- 
tion at the head of the council house, and held up before them the scalp, from which yet dropped 
the warm blood. The house was now full to overflowing ; the young warriors had ceased their 
dance, and repaired to the council en masse to hear of the next day's operation ; every wigwam was 
deserted, and all the warriors choked up that spacious yet temporary house, till there was not room 
for one more spectator. With his usual strength of voice, the Ottawa sachem recounted to the listen- 
ing multitude the manner in which he had procured the scalp he held before them. In the most 
glowing colors he depicted to them the struggle he had to save his life, which he declared was va- 
lueless to himself, but of infinite value to his nation at this critical moment. He shook the scalp in 
the air, and called upon his people to revenge the attempt upon his life, which he assured them was 
only the beginning of a long concocted plot to undermine the power of his nation, and build up ano- 
ther on its ruins. His eloquence ran like lightning tlirough the ranks of warriors, and their various

49 



passions were shown conspicuously upon their features. The young shook their tomahawks in the 
air, and with demoniacal gestures, desired to be led against their enemies. 

At this moment, when all was excitement, the dwarf Pishairo stepped before Pontiac,_and after 
eyeing him for a moment, came closer to him, as if to impart an important secret. The sachem 
stooped down in a listening posture; the dwarf suddenly drew a knife and stuck it to the handle in 
his breast — the blade pierced the heart of Pontiac ! he sank upon the earth and died ; the mighty 
Pontiac, whose name carried terror even among the whites, expired at the feet of his base slave, the 
dwarf Pishairo. A loud burst of rage rang from the lips of every warrior present, who rushed up, 
and seizing the murderer, bore him from the council house ; they no longer thought of their chief, their 
whole thoughts were completely absorbed with revenge. They carried the traitor into an open space, 
and by piece-meal, they cut his flesh from his body. The wretch was one hour expiring. Their re- 
venge satiated, they returned to their fallen sachem, who lay upon the ground dead and stiff". They 
all silently gathered around, wrapped in profound and solemn thought, for now their rage had passed 
away. Long did they stand and silently gaze upon the marble features of him, whose frown could 
have awed so many. At length a chief arose, his hair was as white as the driven snow, and his once 
powerful frame was bent with years ; his voice trembled with age and emotion as he spoke, and he 
was listened to with reverential attention. He recanted the bold exploits of the fallen lion who was 
at their feet, and he dwelt long upon his virtues, which were as many and as bright as the dew-drops 
upon the leaves. The impression could not be resisted even by the stoical warriors ; the large tear- 
drops trickled down their cheeks despite their efforts to conceal them, as they looked upon all that 
remained of Pontiac, the last of the Ottawa sachems. And well might they weep ! for the gigantic 
mind, which kept their tribe to its pinnacle of power, had departed forever ! 

********** 

The daughter of Pontiac wandered about like a restless spirit, till at length she suddenly disap- 
peared from among them ; and for many moons did the red man search after her, but she was not 
to be found, and they finally concluded she had followed her father to the " great hunting grounds 
far away to the rising sun." At length she was discovered — she was the wife of the young com- 
mander of Fort Duquesne, and many of her descendants are living to this day. J. M. S^

Thou wast that all to me, love, 
For which my soul did pine — 

A green isle in the sea, love, 
A fountain and a shrine 

All wreath'd around about with flowers- 
And the flowers, they all were mine. 

But the dream, it could not last ; 

And the star of Hope did rise 
But to be overcast. 

A voice from out the Future cries 
" Onward !" — while o'er the Past, 

(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies, 
Mute, motionless, aghast ! 



I For alas ! alas ! with me. 

Ambition, all, is oer — 
" No more, no more, no more" 
(Such language holds the solemn sea 

To the sands upon the shore) 
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree 

Or the stricken eagle soar. 

And all my hours are trances 
And all my nightly dreams 

Are where thy dark eye glances. 
And where thy footstep gleams, 

In what ethereal dances, 
By what eternal streams. 



REFLECTIONS IN A COUNTRY GRAVE YARD. 



Come, let us recline awhile beneath the wide-spreading branches of this ancient pine, and steal 
from the busy hours a few moments for wholesome meditation. Around us are reposing, in the 
calm tranquillity of dreamless sleep, the friends of our childhood — the beloved of our liper years. A 
holy melancholy, a subdued sorrow, rests with brooding wings upon this solemn bourne. These 
pale violets mark the hallowed spot where slumbers the young mother's darling — the proud father's 
hope. Tears, pure as parental love, have bedewed their opening buds — tears prompted by aflection 
so deep and true that the pure offering has found acceptance in the sight of Him, and a sweet and 
tranquil sorrow steals o'er the hearts of the youthful mourners, purifying and preparing them for 
the solemn change that awaits all mortality. Yon marble column glancing in the sunlight, a sculp- 
tured wreath encircling its cleft brow, tells us of the deep-springing affection of years by thy hand 
severed, oh ! death — of kind tones hushed — of the young household desolate — of the prattling cry 
of laughing infants for their dear mother's voice and smile stilled. The wife, the mother, rests be- 
neath. Mark that venerable monument, by wind-reft pines and time-worn oaks o'ershadowed ! Let 
us, with reverential step, approach and gaze upon its solemn face ! No more is heard the voice of 
admonition, or of calm advice. No more the joyous grand-children climb about grand-pa's knees, 
and shout with merry hearts at his jokes, or weep with breasts o'ercharged with sympathetic grief, 
while breathless listening to the old man's legendary tales. No more beside the cheerful hearth is 
seen that venerable form — that noble brow — those silvered locks. The old man here from his labor 
rests, and his fond family know him no more. Turn we to this simple slab of modest gray ; no 
name — no date proclaims who rests beneath. These deep-hewn lines will tell, perhaps, the story 
of his life. 

STRANGER, STOP! 

Offspring of dust, I dream'd 

A worm might soar ; 
By death to dust rcturn'd, 

I dream no more. 

Stranger, pass on ! 

Nor farther seek to learn ; 
I am, what thou 

Ere long shalt be — a worm. 

Sleep on, afflicted spirit, sleep ! Thy soul was seared by grief, and the pride of thy mortality, 
hath steeled thy heart against its holy influence. Truly, thou hast died as the worm dieth ; but thy 
soul — thy vivifying spirit — hath it gone out wilh thee ? Has the inborn power — the clear compre- 
hending intelligence — the calm, all-grasping reason — the deep, devoted affection — the all-sacrificing 
love — have these all ceased v/ith the throbbing of thy heart 1 Has the inner life — the ethereal es- 
sence — partaken of the decay and annihilation of thy material frame 1 The soft breath of the 
flower-scented morning whispers " No!" The soothing calm of summer's twilight eve murmurs 
" No !" The sheeted lightning and the crashing tempest thunder " No !" The insect humming 
through its happy hour — the shy bird sheltered in some quiet nook — pour forth their voice of love 
and inward sense of happiness. Think you, there mingles no tiibute of the heart with their har- 
monious hymnings '! And thou ! man ! whose mortality rests at my feet — thou, alone, had'st no 
offering for the great Jehovah. He who was, and is, and is to come. Well hast thou called thyself 
worm, if thou did'st feel not the immortal spirit within thee, like the imprisoned bird, beat at the 
material bars that caged it in, and bound it down, and barred it from the sun. 

Oh ! the dim memories, and twilight remembrances ! How like spirits of the air do they flit 
across our souls, wakening to life strange and mysterious recollections of things that have been — 
but when, or where 1 And the echo of the soul only answers, " When, or where V Who has

not thrilled with those entrancing dreams — born of solitude and meditation — as if the soul struggled 
to o'ermaster its earthly doom, and, like a repentant wanderer, return to its old familiar haunts ! 
Say, skeptic, say ! 

Whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire, 
This longing after immortality 1 

It is the echo of a departed existence ; it is the far-off voice of the Past hailing the hurrying Pre- 
sent. Its tones are only heard in the calm of the hushed evening, or in the solemn stillness of the 
midnight hours. Then, when the listening spirit may almost hear the stately music of the revolv- 
ing spheres, 'tis thus she speaks — " Oh, Present! why, with fleet step and agitated mien, speed'st 
thou onward to thy bourne ? That which I was, thou art — what I am, thou shalt become. The 
doom is on thee, and thou can'st not wander from the one path. Why, then, oh why, by the silent 
■way-side wilt thou not sit down and listen to my voice l Thou can'st not hear it in the city's busy 
haunts, or in pleasure's lighted halls. And I will tell thee, oh ! Present, that thou art but a shadow — 
the shadow of the future, as I was of thee. Thou can'st not attain the real or the permanent with 
all thy strugglings. They appertain unto the Future. Let this solemn truth arrest thy anxious 
steps ! Cease to seek that which thou can'st not find, and suffer thyself silently to be borne on the 
calm waters of hope to the bosom of thy destiny. With liberal hand and thankful heart, pluck the 
sweet-scented flowers around thee springing, and let their fragrance sooth thee to rest. A happy 
and a contented spirit is the noblest and the fittest offering thou can'st place upon the altar of thy 
worship. Therefore, be wise, be contented, and thou shalt be happy." C, R. T.

Thy soul shall find itself alone 

'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tomb-stone- 

Not one, of all the crowd, to pry 

Into thine hour of secrecy:

The spirits of the dead who stood

The night — tho' clear — shall frown —

With light like Hope to mortals given— 



But their red orbs, without beam,

MATION AMONG OUR BRITISH PROGENITORS ITS MODERN REGULATIONS AS A PASTIME ITS 

TAIIIOUS IMPLEMENTS AND THEIR USE. 



The use of the bow is of remote antiquity — its obvious simplicity of construction, as well as the 
purposes to which it is adapted, having rendered its employment almost universal from the very ear- 
liest periods of which we have any distinct account. But we do not wish to trouble our readers with 
a disquisition upon its ancient history. It was originally formed, no doubt, of the rough bough of a 
tree, but improvements would be almost immediately discovered. The simple branch would speedily 
be rendered more convenient by a little cutting, so as to make the curve regular on both sides of the 
centre. Homer tells us how the bow of Pandarus was fashioned — 

He heard, and madly at the motion pleased, 
His polished bow with hasty rashness seized. 
'Twas formed of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil; 
A mountain goat resigned the shining spoil. 
Who, pierced long since, beneath his arrows bled ; 
The stately quarry on the cliff lay dead. 
And sixteen palms his brows' large honors spread ; 
The workmen joined and shaped the bended horns, 
And beaten gold each taper point adorns. 

Herodotus says that the bows of the Ethiopians were four cubits, or not less than six feet long. 
The Grecian bow is said to have been of the figure of their own letter sigma. The Scythian bow 
was somewhat of the same form. The bows used by the Daci were made in a very beautiful curve. 
It has been supposed that the Romans introduced the bow into Britain, or at least very much im- 
proved those which they found in use among the natives, and in course of time it became the national 
weapon of the class of inhabitants called yeomen. 

But the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes were certainly well acquainted with the use of the bow; a 
knowledge they derived at an early period from their progenitors. The Scandinavian Scalds, speak- 
ing in praise of the heroes of their countiy, frequently add to the rest of their acquirements a supe- 
riority of skill in handling the bow. It does not, however, appear that this skill was extended be- 
yond the purpose of procuring food, or for pastime, either by the Saxons or by the Danes, in times 
anterior to the conquest. 

Representations of the bow occur frequently in the Saxon MSS. The cut annexed, taken from 
a manuscript of the tenth century found in the Cotton Library, gives the figure of a Saxon bow and 
arrow. The bow is curiously ornamented, having the head and tail of a serpent carved at the ends ; 
and was probably such an one as was used by the nobility. In all these old Saxon bows we may 
observe one thing remarkable, that is, the string not being made fast to the eitremities, but permitted

to play at some distance from them. How far this might be more or less advantageous than the pre- 
sent method, we cannot presume to determine. 







^ 



It is well known that the Normans used the bow as a military weapon; and, under their govern- 
ment, the practice of archery was not only much improved, but generally diffused throughout the 
kingdom. 

In the ages of chivalry the usage of the bow was considered as an essential part of the education 
of a young man who wished to make a figure in life. The heroes of romance are therefore usually 
praised for their skill in archery ; and Chaucer, with propriety, says of sir Thopas, " He was a good 
archere." 

In the seventeenth century archery was much commended as an exercise becoming a gentleman 
to practice, and greatly conducivp to health. The ladies also were foud of this amusement. It was 
usual, when they exercised the bow, for the beasts to be confined by very large enclosures, sur- 
rounded by the hunters, and driven in succession from the covers to the stands, where the fair sports- 
women were placed ; so that they might readily shoot at them, without the trouble and fatigue of 
rousing and pursuing them. It is said of Margaret, the daughter of Henry the Seventh, that when, 
she was on her way towards Scotland, a hunting party was made for her amusement in Alnwick 
Park, where she killed a buck with an arrow. It is not specified whether the long-bow or the cross- 
bow was used by the princess upon this occasion ; we are certain, that the ladies occasionally shot 
with both, for when queen Elizabeth visited lord Montecute at Cowdrey, in Sussex, on the Monday, 
"Her highness tooke horse, and rode into the park, at eight o'clock in the morning, where was a 
delicate bowre prepared, under the which were her highness musicians placed ; and a cross-bow, by 
a nympth, with a sweet song, was delivered into her hands, to shoote at the deere ; about some thirty 
in number were put into a paddock, of which number she killed three oi four, and the countess of 
Kildare one." 

The foregoing observations refer chiefly to the lo7ig-how, so called, to distinguish it from the 
arbalisi, or a-oss-bow, which was not only much shorter than the former, but fastened also upon a 
stock, and discharged by the means of a catch or trigger, which probably gave rise to the lock upon 
the modern musket. We cannot pretend to determine at what period the cross-bow was first brought 
into England, but we believe not long before the commencement of the thirteenth century ; at least, 
we never meet with any representation of such an engine prior to that period. On the continent, 
where probably it originated, its appearance might be somewhat earlier. Historians assure us, that 
Richard the First was wounded by an arrow from a bow of this kind, while he was reconnoitering 
the walls of the castle of Chalezun ; which wound was the occasion of his death. 

The courage, discipline, strength and skill, displayed by British bowmen, during a period of 
more than six centuries, are so much a matter of ordinary history that it is hardly necessary to enlarge 
upon them here. In all the expeditions of which they formed a part, they proved to their adversa- 
ries a terror and a scourge. Even the bare appearance of a body of English archers in the field, often 
led to a bloodless victory ; and, as experience had proVed that the best armor was no protection against 
their arrows, their bold and confident spiiit often led them into very unequal contests. 

Secured in their position by an ingenious mode of fortification, — the materials for which each 
archer carried on his person, — the English bowmen laughed to scorn the fiercest charges of the steel- 
clad chivalry of the middle ages. Of all the European nations, none suffered more severely, or more 
requently, from the effects of their archery than the French. Like the Italians, when invaded by the 
Huns, — another nation of formidable bowmen, — they composed a mass, expressly depreciating the 
calamities it inflicted upon them : — " Ab AngUcorum nos defendejacidls /" — " From the arrows of 
the English, defend us, O Lord !" 

The ancient legislators, ever on the watch to encourage and enforce the practice of this art, once 
the sole guardian of the national independence, passed many judicious laws to prevent its falling into 
disuse. By these, a fine of one mark was levied on every master of a family who permitted any of 
his male inmates to be without a bow and three shafts, for the space of a month.* The local autho- 



54 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

rities were required to superintend the erection of public butts, in the environs of every town and 
village. Many of their ancient positions are yet known, however different the uses to which the 
ground where they once stood, is at present applied. 

The nobility and spiritual persons were, by law, excepted ; but men of every other rank and calling 
assembled, at these public shooting-grounds, to ply the sturdy yew and gallant gray goose wing. 
Thither the lordly baron sent his feudal vassals ; thither came the squire, the independent franklyn, 
the wealthy yeoman, the lude peasant, and the unwashed artizan. All formed one promiscuous 
multitude, of which the numbers, in populous districts, were so considerable that, after the first season, 
the grass never grew around these public marks. 

The sabbaths and other holidays vi'ere appropriated, by the statute, for these exercises of archery. 
But our British progenitors, enthusiastically attached to their favorite weapon, rendered all penal 
enactments, for a series of ages, unnecessary. The intervals of labor were all devoted to the shoots 
ing-giound, and their bows and arrows accompanied them in every excursion. 

The extreme range of a flight shaft, when discharged from one of their ancient bows, is stated to 
have been four hundred yards, or nearly one quarter of a mile.-j- At about a fourth of this distance, 
the war arrow would penetrate any ordinary breast-plate, and slay man or hoise at little short of 
two-thirds of it. To maintain and promote this strong and vigorous shooting, the statute of the 
33d of Henry the Eighth forbade any man, above the age of foui-and- twenty, to use the lighter kind 
of arrows, unless the butts were upwards of two hundred and twenty yards apart. After the pro- 
mulgation of this law, the strong and dexterous archers frequently increased the distance, of their 
own accord, to two hundred and forty yards. The practice is alluded to by Shakspeare, who, beyond 
all question, was not only a bowman, but an accomplished one. A contempt for mediocrity is one 
of the characteristics of genius. The pursuits of his juvenile days — for we have all read of his moon- 
light excursions to Charlecot Deer-Park, — the law of the land, which permitted no youth of his age 
and rank to remain one month without a bow and shafts — are sufficient evidence ; and, if more were 
wanting, we have it under his own hand. 

Burke once playfully observed — and the pointed sally is characteristic of that great man — th^t 
fox-hunting formed nf ui mportant balance of the British constitution. His meaning is sufficiently 
obvious. The chase, oy bringing the aristocracy into familiar contact with the gentry and middle 
classes of society, broke down the bar of exclusiveness, and led to a mutual interchange of good 
offices, socially, and in many instances, poUtically advantageous to each. 

" And surely" — says a very agreeable writer, and one evidently well conversant with the sub- 
ject — " the praise of these excellent qualities belongs more especially to modern archery. No visi- 
tant of the splendid bow-meetings which each revolving summer recals into existence, throughout the 
sylvan glades of this romantic land, ever remained uninfluenced by the joyous hilarity, the delight- 
ful ease and freedom which light each countenaKce with smiles. There, where men of various ranks, 
and, grace d Dieu ! women too assemble, to bear away — 

The arrow with a golden head, 
A.nd shaft of silver white, — 

the plumed hat and forest gieen place all upon a temporary equality. Superior adroitness alone con- 
fers distinction. The possessor of- a ducal coronet, whose ill-aimed shaft flies wide of the mark, cheer- 
fully yields precedence to the untitled bowman who has placed Ids within its broad circlet of gold. 
Hail then to the free, frank, and joyous spirits which compose an assemblage of British bowmen ! 
No doubt but the circumstances under which the arclier pursues his amusement, have considerable 
influence in producing this happy condition of mind. The balmy breezes of summer, — the charms 
of picturesque scenery, — the romance with which glorious tradition has invested his pursuits, — and 
the emulation engendered by the knowledge that most of his competitors boast a skill little inferior 
to his own, — keep the spirits in a state of agreeable excitement. He cannot be unconscious that he 
is ' the observed of all observers ;' for every attitude — whether it be the preliminary action of string- 
ing the bow, or the final one by which an arrow is discharged against a distant mark, — displays un- 
rivalled manliness and grace. His bow, arrows, belt, bracer and shooting-glove are, for the most part, 
exact counterparts of those used by England's yeomanry, five centuries ago. Even the attire in 
which he shoots bears a general resemblance to the costume of the same warlike period. These 
things never fail to tinge imaginations at all excitable with a strong feeling of enthusiasm; and 
which the regulations of an archery fete are certainly not calculated to weaken. The contest takes 
place in the presence, and amidst the plaudits, of assembled hundreds. 

Store of ladies, wl.oje bright eyes

are there ; and from the hands of female beauty he receives the reward of his dearly-earned triumph.

in modern times, the introduction of the bow, as a suitable and healthful recreation for their fair 
countrywomen ,■ — and it was fortunate that their individual position in society entitled them to dic- 
tate laws to fashion, under whose powerful auspices the practice of archery by females was intro- 
duced to the world. 

ht Attended by a fair portion of the excitement peculiar to the chase, but without its perils and its 
cruelty requiring no excessive corporeal exertion — offering a combination of the rhost graceful po- 
sitions appropriate to every other exercise, — and invariably associated with refined and polished so- 
ciety, archery, from that time, made rapid advances in public estimation. The British fair quickly 

emancipated themselves from the ancient tyranny of back-bones, embroidery frames, spinnets, harp- 
sichords, and all the other foolery of their grandmothers. 

In the goode greene woode, 
Among the lilie flower, 

they sought that health and vivacity which pure air and active exertion can alone confer. 
?■ The ladies associated with the woodmen were, originally, restricted to their own, immediate family 
connexions. Soon, however, the admissions became less exclusive. The piizes awarded by this so*. 
ciety have always been distinguished for their splendor and variety. But the Aylesfords, the Mor- 
daunts, the Adamses, the Molands, and the Bagots, of the last — with the Boultbees, the Parkers, 
the Gresleys, and the Wises, of the present, age — the fair victors who have won, or still ' win and 
wear them' — have displayed a skill in all respects worthy of their magnitude. 




Mrs. Crespigny's public breakfasts were another interesting feature in the annals of female archery. 
Many a deUghtful morning's lounge did these same breakfasts afford to such of the ' fashionable 
world' as had the good fortune to obtain cards of invitation. They were the most literal and prac- 
tical illustrations of the utile dulci that I ever knew. The company shot ' games,' as they are caIIc«J 
in the technicalities of archery. Eleven was the decisive number ; and the arrows count according 
to their positions in the target. A shot in the gold circle reckons as nine, — the red, seven, — the 
inner white, five, — the black, three, — the outer white, one. Fines of half-a-crown were paid by the 
losers, the amount being appropriated to the support of a Sunday-school. The girls of the charity 
attended these archery meetings, attired in dresses of grass-green. 

One hundred yards was the space between the targets. When the gentlemen had shot, they 
walked, in procession with the ladies, thirty paces forward ; and the latter then discharged their ar- 
rows, at the unusual distance of seventy yards. Many will agree with me in thinking that these 
archety breakfasts might be judiciously revived, at the present day."

REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS 



The History of the Navy of the United States of America. By J. Fenimore Cooper. Lea and 

Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

In appealing before the public with this History of our Navy, Mr. Cooper has had two serious 
difficuUies to surmount — one of prejudice, and one of exaggerated anticipation. It cannot be denied 
that, for many years past, he has been rapidly sinking in the estimation of his countrymen, and in- 
deed of all right minded persons. Even his firmest friends were becoming ashamed of the univer- 
sality of his cynicism ; and his enemies, ceasing in a measure from open hostility, have been well 
content to abide the apparently inevitable self-ruin which his own unconquerable ill temper was so 
speedily bringing about. A flashy succession of ill-conceived and miserably executed literary pro- 
ductions, each more silly than its predecessor, and wherein the only thing noticeable was the pee- 
vishness of the writer, the only thing amusing his self-conceit — had taught the public to suspect even 
a ladical taint in the intellect, an absolute and irreparable mental leprosy, rendering it a question 
whether he ever would or could again accoinplish any thing which should be worthy the attention 
of people not positively rabid. In this state of affairs, it was not ut all wonderful that the announce- 
ment of a Naval History of the United States, by the author of the attack upon Sir Walter Seott, 
was received with apathy and general distrust — with a feeling very different indeed from that which 
would have agitated the whole reading world at a similar announcement during the golden days of 
the celebrated novelist, and once exceedingly popular man. 

Among the few, on the other hand, who had better opportunities of penetrating the mystery, and 
fathoming the extent, of that obstinate disease of the spleen which had so long made the author a 
burden to himself, and an object of compassion to his friends — among those who knew the disorder 
not altogether incurable, and who had good reason to rely firmly upon the innate vigor and elastici- 
ty of the constitution — even among these we have noticed a want of proper consideration in regard 
to the subject matter of the anticipated work — a misconception of the extent and capacities of the 
theme — which has operated to the temporary disadvantage of the historian. 

Mr. Cooper's strength in sea narrative was well known, and justly appreciated ; and in a work 
on Naval Histoiy, much was expected of a character very similar to that which had afforded its 
charm to the " Pilot," and rivetted attention in the " Red Rover." This expectation would have 
been comparatively well founded had the announcement been that of a Naval Biography, Here, an 
allowable minuteness of detail would have given vigor and vitality to the narration, and the person- 
al adventures of the several heroes would have been overspread, in the simple discussion of fact 
with all the warm hues of the most spirit-stirring romance. In no general naval record, however, 
should we look too confidently for interest, beyond that grave species which is attached to the mere 
statement of fact. In records of our own marine, especially, we should look for little farther than 
this. The story of the simple events of our expeiience (for we are a nation of single ships) must 
always be deficient in that excitement which is derivable from the unity and majesty of the combined 
operations of fleets. Here then our sea-history labors under disadvantages not experienced by that 
of Europe. The tales we have to tell, of detached combat after combat, can form, at best, but a series 
of monotonous episode, where if the mind seeks, as it will, for connexion, this can only be establish- 
ed by means of a diy and barren mass of documental and statistical detail. 

Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, (whose importance we have by no means adequately 
pointed out) Mr. Cooper has succeeded in writing a book which cannot fad to do him lasting honor, 
not more in a literary point of view, than as affording evidence of the final triumph of his kindlier 
and more manly feelings over the promptings of Satan and the spleen. The very preface is redolent 
of a returning good humor — of a recovered modesty — of a resuscitated common sense. Mr. Cooper 
is evidently Mr. Cooper once again, and as such we most cordially welcome him home to the good 
XT ill, and to the affections, of his countrymen. That he, in preference to any one, should have writ- 
ten the Naval History of the United States, is a matter about which there is but little difference of 
opinion; and we rejoice, from the bottom of our heart, that he has arisen to the good work, from the 
moral death which has so long enwrapped him, while it is yet a convenient season for the under- 
taking — ^before the veteran actors in the drama have all passed away from among us — while there is 
yet many a tongue to tell what the eyeshave seen — many a living witness to the gallant and glorious 
exploits which have had so much to do in the rendering us, and in the preserving us, a free people. 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 57 

It is not our design, of course, to speak at length of any portion of a History which will speak scr 
very eloquently for itself. The narrative commences with the first settlement by the English, pro- 
ceeds with some details respecting the earliest achievements of the rival French and British colonies, 
connected with a clear and rapid survey of the condition of the maritime powers of Europe, and 
after discussing, in a masterly manner, every momentous event in the annals of our Navy, terminates 
•with the contest of 1812. The war of the Revolution is brought to a close about the middle of the 
first volume, and the more important subsequent occurrences occupy the lemainder of the publication. 

The work, as a whole, has, wc think, all the great requisites of a proper History — distinctness of 
narration, rigorous impartiality, an evident anxiety for truth, and a concise philosophical discussion 
of fact, rather than a shadowy speculation upon motive. Every similar book, as a matter of course, 
is liable to objection — to cavil — in regard to its detail ; and, in the present case, we have heard oc- 
casional censures upon which we scarcely think it necessary to comment. Battles, whether by sea 
or land, (and battles form our staple here) are seldom witnessed by distinct authorities from the same 
points of observation, and this fact alone is sufficient to account for a thousand immaterial discre- 
pancies. 

In legard to style, let us hear Mr. Cooper himself. 

" Some of the greatest writers of the age have impaired the dignity of their works, by permitting 
the peculiarities which have embelllslied their lighter labors to lessen the severity of manner that 
more properly distinguishes narratives of truth. This danger has been foreseen in the present in- 
stance, though the nature of the subject, which seldom rises to the level of general history, affords a 
constant temptation to offend. A middle course has been adopted, which, it is hoped, while some 
defects of execution may probably be detected, will be found on the whole to be suited to a recital of 
facts, in the familiar form that, in a measure, the incidents have demanded." 

The mere English of our author was never, at any period, remarkable for precision of arrange- 
ment, and however easily, in a work of pure romance, such defect may be disregarded, we must own 
that it derogates very materially from the beauty of an otherwise excellent historic style. In the 
volumes before us sentences occur, by far too frequently, where positive ambiguity arises from sheer 
negligence in regard to the ordinary proprieties of grammar. 

" Republicanism itself is brought into disrepute, in denying the just rewards of long services to 
officers, by attaching to it the weakness of a neglect of incentives, an ignorance on the subject of the 
general laws of discipline, and the odium of injustice. It is by forgetting the latter quality, more 
through the indifference of a divided power, than from any other cause, that republics have obtained 
their established character of being ungrateful." 

Here is great confusion of expression. By '' the latter quality" justice is intended, while 2??jus- 
tice is implied. 

" A territorial aristocracy, promotion, in both the army andthenav}', is the inevitable fruit of favor, 
or of personal rank." 

This sentence, as it stands, is utterly unintelligible, and can only be comprehended at all by placing 
before it the words immediately antecedent — which are " The nature of the English government is 
no secret." It now appears that the English government is " a territorial aristocracy." But every 
properly constructed sentence should have within itself the means of its own (grammatical) compre- 
hension. 

" The man who, refusing to adopt remedies that he believes unsuited to his constitution, is dis- 
creet, when he carries his system so far as to forget to look for others to supply their places, becomes 
careless and culpable." 

This exceedingly ambiguous proposition is rendered perfectly plain by merely a different arrange 
ment of the same words. 

" The man who is discreet in refusing to adopt remedies that he believes unsuited to his constitu- 
tion, becomes careless and culpable when he carries his system so far as to forget to look for others 
to supply their places." But upon this topic quite enough has been said. 

Mr. Cooper's observations on the subject of our general marine policy are, v/e think, among the 
very best portions of his book. They are strikingly comprehensive in view, and evince a profound 
knowledge of the true incentives of human action. Our limits will permit us to give but a small por- 
tion of his remarks. 

"A careful review of these facts and principles must satisfy all who study the subject, that the 
United States of America have never resorted to the means necessary to dovelope, or even in a limit- 
ed sense, to employ their own naval resources. As a consequence, they have never yet enjoyed the 
advai^tage of possessing a powerful marine in time of war, or have felt its influence in sustaining 
their negotiations, and in supporting their national rights in a time of peace. As yet the ships of 
America have done little more than show the world what the republic might do with its energies duly 
directed, and its resources properly developed, by demonstrating the national aptitude for this species 
of warfare. 

" But the probationary period of the American marine is passing away, and the body of the peo- 
ple are beginning to look forward to the appearance of their fleets on the ocean. It is no longer 
thought there is an unfitness in the republic's possessing heavy ships ; and the opinion of the country 



in this, as in other respects, is slowly rising to the level of its wants. Still many lingering prejudices 
remain in the public mind, in connexion with this all important subject, and some that threaten the 
service with serious injury. Of these, the most prominent are, the mode in which the active vessels 
are employed ; a neglect of the means of creating seamen for the public service ; the fact that there 
is no force in commission on the Ameiican coast; the substitution of money for pride and self-respectj 
^s the aim of military men ; and the impairing of discipline, and lessening the deference for the jusr 
tice of the state, by the denial of rank. 

" Undei the present system of employing the public vessels, none of the peculiar experience that 
belongs to the higher objects of the profession is obtained. While ships may be likened to regiments 
as regards the necessity of manoeuvring together, there is one important feature in which they are 
totally dissimilar. It may be pretty safely thought that one disciplined regiment will march as far, 
«adure as much, and occupy its station as certainly as another, but no such calculation can be made 
■an ships. The latter are machines, and their qualities may be improved by human ingenuity, when 
their imperfections have been ascertained by experiment. Intelhgent comparisons are the first step 
m this species of improvement. 

*' It will be clear to the dullest mind, that the evolutions of a fleet, and, in a greater or less degree. 
Its success, must be dependent on the qualities of its poorest vessels ; since its best cannot abandon 
their less fortunate consorts to the enemy. The naval history of the world abounds with instances^ 
in which the efforts of the first sea-captains have been frustrated by the defects of a portion of the 
ships under their command. To keep a number of vessels in compact order, to cause them to prer 
serve their weatherly position in gales and adverse winds, and to bring them all as near as possible 
up to the standard that shall be formed by the most judicious and careful commander, is one of the 
iiighest aims of naval experience. On the success of such eflorts depend the results of naval evolu- 
tions more frequently than on any dexterity in fighting guns. An efficient fleet can no more be 
formed without practice in squadrons, than an efficient army without evolutions in brigades. By not 
keeping ships in squadrons, there will also be less emulation, and consequently less improvement. 

" Under the present system three principal stations aie maintained ; two in the Atlantic, and one 
in the Mediterranean. On neither of these stations would the presence of a vessel larger than a sloop 
of war be necessary, on ordinary occasions, provided a force of heavy ships could periodically and un- 
expectedly appear on all. It is seldom that a single ship of the line is required on any sei-vice; and 
it is ceitain that a solitary two-decked vessel could have no great influence on those important in- 
terests which it is the practice of the rest of Christendom to refer to the agency of fleets. By putting 
in commission six or eight two-decked ships, and by causing them to appear, from time to time, on 
all the more important stations this side of the two great southern capes, the country, at no material 
additional cost, would obtain the several objects of practice in fleets, of comparative trials of the 
qualities of the most important class of vessels in the navy, of a higher state of discipline, and of a 
vast improvement in the habits of subordination on the part of commanders, a defect that all expe* 
rience shows is peculiar to the desultory mode of service now in use, and which has produced more 
naval disasters in the world than probably any other one cause. In a word, the principal ends of a 
siavy can no more be obtained, by the services of single ships, than wars can be decided by armies 
cut up into battalions." 



JLedure on the Study of Histwy, applied to the Progress of CiviUzatimi. Delivered by Appoint 
merit before the Union Literary Society, May 2d, 1839. 

A brilliant and bold production, bearing the impress of the mind of its author. With the tenets, 
liowever, here so well supported by Mr.Dimitry we will not altogether coincide. They border sMueT 
what too closely, in our apprehension, upon the eloquent madness of Turgot, Price, Priestly, Con', 
dorcet, and De Stael — yet, strange to say, none of these names occur in the Lecture with the excep- 
tion perhaps, of that of Priestly, in an incidental manner! There can be no doubt, however, at what 
sparkling fountains our author has imbibed his scarcely tenable notions of the perfectibility of man. 
For to this end, more than to any other, tend the doctrines and the arguments of the essay. In thfl 
position itself we have little faith, but great faith in the ability of our fiiend to make the best of a bad 
topic. This, in the present instance, he has undoubtedly accomplished, as the spirited passage aa- 
iiexed will testify more fully than any assertion of our own. 

" The highest degree of perfection to which man is, by nature, destined, grows out of the free an4 
complete development of his individuality, under the influences of beauty, goodness, and truth, aruj 
of his close and brotherly union with his fellow-laborers on earth. The principle of human perfeo» 
tibility will, therefore, when fully developed, induce a state in which mind and matter, reconciled to 
each other, will produce a lofty and splendid harmony; in which each special order of mind will find 
a corresponding object, and a proper sphere of action and usefulness ; in which man, instead of wast, 
ing his powers in fruitless strifes, will exert them in subjugating material nature; in which the iHr

jury, accruing to one member, and profiting no one, shall be considered, by ail, as wrong inflicted 
on the whole of society ; in which the shackling of evil passions will put an end to the conflict be- 
tween virtue and vice — a conflict which will be survived by a generous emulation, only, among the 
worthy, to do the most good ; a state of rest, which will not be indolent inaction, and a state of action, 
which shall have ceased to be tumultvious agitation. Then, and then only, shall the promises of the 
martyr-God be realized. Then, and then only, shall it be truly said of man that he loves his neigh- 
bor as himself; for he will love him as a part of a whole, of which he himself is but another part. 
Then, and then only, shnll Japheth's daring seed, as the Roman lyrist calls us, i-econquer the sym- 
bolical Aiden, forfeited by the common ancestor, exulting in the choice spoils which they shall have 
gathered during their centuries of toil in the fields of the arts and the sciences. 

Such is the society which awaits the futurity of the world. Under what combination of circum- 
stance and time it shall be fashioned, cannot be ascertained. But history unerringly points to it — 
reason sanctions it ; while, at the same time, it teaches that it shall be given to man to compass its 
attainment ; for reason embodies certain invariable principles which, when once asserted and grasped 
by the people, ai'e used by them as a resting point for farther and extended operations. In regard to 
the principles themselves, their progress will no longer consist in variation, innovation, or change j 
but their immutability shall be the basis of all improvement, which, out of this condition, would be 
liable to the same oscillations and doubts, m the midst of which man has hitherto all but fruitlessly 
consumed his powers and his strength. Now, those principles will obtain so soon as natural law — 
I mean the law deduced from human reason, as a criterion of truth — the law inherent to our sociable 
nature, and harmonising with humanity in all places and time ; so soon as that law, in accordance 
with the moral law of Christiarrity, shall have every where supplanted the conventional law, which 
is not based, however we may try to conceal it, upon the general constitution of human nature, but 
upon the partial interests of individuals, corporations, cities, provinces, and States — upon the neces- 
sity of circumstances and the will of the lawmaker. 

That such a society may bs realized in a given time we are bound to believe with as much cer- 
tainty as we believe that we are gifted with the exercise of reason. We must, otherwise, surrender 
to the harrowing conviction that our appearance here is but an aimless and fantastic farce ; that some 
evil genius, after having engraved in our nature an instinct of that which is impossible, mocks at out 
insatiable appetences and our panting efforts round a charmed circle, in which we ever return to the 
starting point ; that, after all, the tradition of Tantalus is no fable ; and that this world is but a vast 
gehenna, irr which perpetual torture and perpetual disappointment are the inevitable lot of man. But 
how can we withhold our faith from a doctrine co-extensive with the mind, and brilliant as hope 
itself? A doctrine for which the Savior suffered on earth ; and which martyrs and sages have vin- 
dicated with their blood and their lives, offered up in testimony of its truth 1 Many may view these 
monitions of history as phantasms of the brain ; oi brand rational inductions as Utopian dreams. Let 
them ! When the first troglodyte issued from his cavern into the social world, and returned to his 
fellow-intelligent brutes with the story of civilization abroad, they met his words with derision and 
scorn ! They, bound in the darkness of their caves and the filth of their clay hovels, could not realize 
the splendors of the palace and the comforts of its life. They too — had the supercilious word, in- 
vent€d by their imitators, been known — they, too, would have exclaimed, Utopia! They, whose 
inch-deep intellect, or whose all-controlling prejudices, stop at the surface of things, and, viewing the 
evils only which still afflict society, pronoimce the notiotr of perfectibility to be chimerical and vain, 
they do not intelligently attend to the sober teachings of reason and truth. Marr, as a sensual being, 
belongs to the world of the senses ; and that is an habitual state of war between his physical powers'— 
a bellum omnium contra omnes — a war of all against all. But, again, man, as a rational being, also 
belongs to the world of mind ; and, as such, he is destined, by the law of his spiritual nature, to subf 
due the material world. The complement of that law will be to defeat the belligerance of material 
forces; and, at some providential period, to assert the full and definite triumph of reason, and the 
consequent prevalence of happiness and peace. Individuals now enjoy that triumph of reason and 
blessing of peace. Why should they not extend to the collective being called society 1 To argue 
that it cannot, is to argue that there is no essential law that will equally apply to man in. his indi- 
vidual and social capacity : it is to advance an unnatural, an anti-social, and a degrading paradox : 
it is to strike at the vitality of virtue, through the freedom of man's will, and madly to insult the 
superhuman wisdom of Him who made man the proxy of his power!" 



Franda^s Reign of Terror, being a Sequel to Letters on Paraguay. By J, P. and W. P. Bof 
hinson. E. L. Carey and A. Hart, Philadelphia. 

The " Letters on Paraguay" were exceedingly well received by the reading puDlic, and this is a 
matter not at all to be wondered at. Previous to their publication, little, comparatively, was knovm 
of the country they described, and that little was shadowy and vague. We knew that Paraguay 
existed ; that it was an inland region of South America ; that it had been the seat of the Jeauite.

that it had become independent of the mother country, and finally fallen under the dominion of a 
certain Doctor Francia. All farther than this has been a knowledge of recent date, due to the litera- 
ry labors of the Robinsons. 

Dr. Francia is, beyond doubt, one of the most remarkable characters of the age, and a man whose 
entire nature has been misunderstood. An array of startling facts here given, will go far to prove 
him a stern despot and a blood-thirsty tyrant, rather than the prudent and amiable pacificator which 
our imaginations have hitherto painted him. 



Isabel; or Sicily. A Pilgrimage, By Henry T, Tuckerman. Lea and Blanchard, Phila- 
delphia. 

Mr. Tuckerman is known as the author of the "Italian Sketch Book," and of many very readable 
articles in the magazines and annuals. Without much of profundity, of originality, or vigor, he is 
more than usually pure in style, and orthodox in sentiment. The present work will, we think, greatly 
enhance his reputation as a graceful and agreeable writer. The general plan has apparently been 
suggested by that of Bulwer's Pilgrims of the Rhine — although here the similarity ceases. 
Frederick Otley, an American gentleman, travels in Europe with the view of alleviating his grief 
for the loss of a beloved wife, leaving in his southern home a daughter, in charge of her uncle, his 
brother. The absence of the traveller is long continued, and the daughter, having grown to wo- 
manhood, forms the design of surprising him by a visit in Sicily, of which countiy Otley, in his last 
letter, expressed an intention of making the tour. The uncle accompanies her on the voyage, and the 
volume concludes with the re-union of the family. The main, indeed the whole design, is to pre- 
sent the reader with a picturesque account of Sicily, and with the author's own reflections during a 
tour in that comparatively little travelled portion of the old world. The chain of fiction above men- 
tioned, (which appears to us somewhat supererogatory) is given, says Mr. T., for the purpose of 
avoiding that egotistical tone from which it is dithcult to escape in a formal journal, as well as to 
obviate the necessity of dwelling upon those unimportant details and circumstances which aie com- 
mon to every tour m Europe, and therefore too familiar to be interesting. There is an air of quiet 
enthusiasm pervading the whole of tliis little book, which, insensibly, has its influence upon the 
mind of the reader — disposing him to think well of Mr. Tuckerman as a man, not less than to be 
pleased with him as an author. There is much in his character, as we gather it from " Isabel," of 
the warmest poetical impulse — of a perfectly unaffected romance. 



Memoirs of Celebrated Womeji, Edited by G. P. R. James, Esq., author of De V Orme, Life of 
the Black Prince, etc. etc. E. L. Carey and A. Hart, Philadelphia. 

In general we dislike such title-pages as this. There is a misty atmosphere of humbug all about 
them, through which we peer with a suspicious eye. Time was when the duties of an editor were 
matter of perfect simplicity — at least so far as concerned the public comprehension of these duties; 
but " we have changed all that" as the world grows older, and in every such announcement as we 
find here, there always \\es perdu a very pretty little enigma. 

In its solution there are several points to be considered. Sometimes, as in the case of those su- 
perb passionate tales the "Recollections of a Chaperon," the work will be written, as well as edited, 
by a Lady Dacre. Here there is an affectation of modesty — yet the affectation is not altogether un- 
graceful. Of all the modern editorship this is, beyond doubt, the species least objectionable. 

The editorship protective is cf a different class. Here, as in the case of Mr. Willis, (whose fine 
taste should have taught him more intelligible things,) the author makes a somewhat droll bow to a 
foreign audience, holding fast (God only knows why) to the arm of a Barry Cornwall. However, 
there is no harm in the world done, and the worst that can happen is a good hearty laugh on the 
part of the public. 

But there is a third order of this editorial humbuggery which is positively no joke, and which 
should never be regarded as such by any decent individual. An example is found in the case of the 
London publisher, Bentley, who had the downright impudence to get up, some time ago, a reprint 
of our own admirable " Nick of the Woods," and announce it (no doubt to the great edification of 
Dr. Bird,) as under the editorial supervision of Mr. Benjamin D'Israeli. 

In the present instance Mr. James evinces, we think, a sort of half consciousness of being engaged 
in a rather silly affair. The whole preface has the countenance oiun mouton qui reve. " To day," 
he says, with the air of an injured man, " it is necessary for an editor to state what he really has 
done for the work he edits, lest any false impression should be adopted by the pubhc." Having 
premised thus much, he goes on to show very clearly that in the case now in question he has done — 
piecisely nothing at all. We could not wish a better commentary upon the whole editorial system. 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 61 

The work itself (which we are told, is by an aunt of the author of Richelieu) is a plainly written 
compilation of interesting matters, sufficiently familiar to every ordinary reader of history. We have 
memoiis of Joan of Arc, of Margaret of Anjou, of Lady Jane Grey, of Anna Commena, of Madame 
de Maintenon, of Elizabeth of England, and of Donna Maria Pacheco. 



Advice to a Young Gentleman on entering Society. By the Author of the " Laws of Etiquette" 
Lea and Blanchard. Philadelphia. 

Taking up tliis volume with a strong feeling of prejudice, induced by a certain ad captandum 
air in the title, our attention was ri incited by the very initial sentences, and before getting through 
with the second page we acknowledged the hand of a master. The book is replete with a wordly 
wisdom even profound ; it is the product of a vigorous and cultivated mind, imbued with a thorough 
knowledge of its subject, and discussing it con amore. 

The leading truths here inculcated, are, we think, the more important, because, being through 
their very nature confined to superficialities, or apparently so confined, the world at large is easily 
disposed to fall in with those frequent opinions of the grave and learned which declare them inessen- 
tial. But in this case we challenge the judgment of the tribunal, and will not abide by any decision 
which shall be " grave and learned." Pour savoir ce qu'il est (^DieuJ ilfaut etre Dieu meme, says 
the Baron de Bielfeld, in speaking of a more august subject ; but the spirit of his remark is abund- 
antly applicable to the present matter in hand. To form any just estimate of the importance of 
habitual intercourse with our fellows, and, more especially, of an attentive regard to the modelling 
and polishing of our social habits, we must already be men of the world — we must have felt all the 
miseries of a niauvaise honte, and have revelled in all the luxury of a disenthralment from its bonds. 

Upon the evils of an absolutely unsocial eKistence it is folly to comment. He who has, at any 
period, entered with heart into the proper spirit of a high society, will find even a temporary with- 
drawal from its usages (urged, let us say, by necessity, or induced by disgust, or sought for the se- 
verer purposes of study) followed by very serious inconveniences, often by poignant mortifications, 
always by a thorough conviction of man's unfitness for such existence, and of its enervating and de- 
basing influence upon his intellectual powers, if not upon the whole organization of his moral being. 
Collecting and concentrating in his retirement an imaginary strength, the solitary student makes at 
length, for some long designed effort, a step into the world of busy life — but this step is feebly and 
irresolutely advanced. A farther progress fully awakens him to his weakness and his folly. The 
volition is in abeyance, which should vivify his forces, and impart to them decision. He now feels 
and perhaps acknovvledges his error. 

We could name no book whatever, in which are better exemplified the truth of opinions such as 
these than in the unpretending volume now before us. In almost every respect it is a valuable and 
exceedingly well written treatise. Among the detailed precepts which form its body there is, per- 
haps, little to be found which the letters of Lord Chesterfield have not already given. But without 
the oflTensive heartlessness of those very objectionable writings, this American work equals them, at 
least, in all their reputable poists — in vigor of thought and diction, in acumen, in practicability, and 
in eyideiaces of wordly knowledge. 



A Synopsis of Natural History ,- embracing the Natural History of Animals, with Human and 
General Animal Physiology, Botany, Vegetable Physiology, and Geology. Translated from 
the latest French Edition of C. Lemmonnier, Professor of Natural History in the Boyal Col- 
lege of Charlemagne ,- luith Additions from the Works of Cuvier, Dumaril, Lacepede, etc. Ar- 
ranged as a Text Book for Schools. By Thomas Wyatt, A. M., Author of Elements of Botany, 
a Manual of Conchohgy, etc. Thomas Wardle, Philadelphia. 

Mr. Wyatt is favorably known to the public as the author of an exceedingly well arranged, ac- 
curate, and beautifully illustrated " Conchohgy," and has been mainly instrumental, we believe, in 
drawing that public attention to the science in this country which is now so obviously manifested. 
We hope that his success with the present publication will be commensurate with the wider range 
which he has taken. It cannot be denied that a synopsis such as he now puts forth has been long 
a desideratum. While there has been no deficiency of school books in any one of the sciences em- 
braced within a proper course of Natural History, it must still have occurred to many as singular, 
that in a study whose very existence may be said to depend upon method, there should have been, 
hitherto, no attempt at collecting the parts into an easily discernible whole. 

As the work of Mr. Wyatt professes to be simply a translation of the well known Tableaux of 
M. Lemmonnier, we need say little more in the way of recommendation than that all the useful 
spirit of the original has been preserved — and this we say from personal knowledge, and the closest

inspection and collation. In changing the tabular form of the French publication to one better suit- 
ing the purposes of our x\merican schools, some little latitude was of course admissible and unavoid- 
able. The book is a large octavo, beautifully printed on fine paper, and illustrated by forty-nine well 
executed plates. Copies, colored with accuracy, under the superintendence of Mr. James Ackermann, 
are for sale at our principal bookstores. The whole work does credit to all parties, and should be 
patronized, not less for its intrinsic value than as a matter of just poUcy, by all Philadelphians who 
have the publishing interest of the city at heart. 



Sketches of Public Characters, Discourses, and Essays, To which is added a Dissertation on the 
Eloquence of the Ancietits. By Henry Lm-d Brougha7n. Philadelphia, E. L. Carey and A. 
Hart. 

This is an exceedingly interesting work, and should be in the hands of every one who reads at 
all. The first volume is made up of the mtroductions to the different speeches of Lord Brougham, 
which were intended to elucidate the history of certain measures discussed, and, incidentally, of the 
periods to which they related. The aim is, to give a pictui'e of the times, in an account of the per- 
sons who bore the chief part in their transactions, in the supposition that the course of state affairs^ 
their posture at any given period, and the nature of the different measures propounded from time to 
time, can only be well understood by giving an accurate representation of the characters of those 
who figured most remarkably upon the stage. This portion of the book embraces a world of detail 
concerning Cobbett, Stephen, Perceval, Roscoe, Lord Castlereagh, Homer, Wilberforce, Bentham, 
Sir James Mackintosh, Canning, Huskisson, Grattan, and others. 

The second volume is occupied with Lord Brougham's inaugural discourse on being installed 
Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow ; practical obsei-vations upon the education of the people ; 
and a dissertation on the eloquence of the Ancients ; with an appendix of translations from De- 
mosthenes. In the matters here contained. Lord Brougham fully sustains his reputation for sound 
scholarship, as well as profound and luminous criticism. The whole work is imbued with the racy 
spirit of the author's own intellect — an intellect essentially Demosthenic in the almost rude strength, 
directness, and impetuosity of its operations. We cannot too pointedly press this excellent publi- 
cation upon the attention of our readers. The following passage is from a paper on marriage, di- 
vorce, and legitimacy. 

" To illusti-ate by example his (Sir Wdliam Scott's) singularly refined and pungent wit in con- 
versation, or the happy and unexpected quotations with which he embellished it, or the tersely told 
anecdotes with which he enlivened it, without for an instant fatiguing his audience, would be diffi- 
cult — ^because it is of the nature of the refined essence in which the spirit of the best society con- 
sists, not to keep. When some sudden, and somewhat violent changes of opinion were imputed to 

a learned judge, who was always jocosely termed Mrs , " Varium et mutabile semper fcemina" 

was Sir William Scott's remark. A celebrated physician having said, somewhat more flippantly 
than beseemed the gravity of his cloth, " Oh, you know. Sir William, after forty a man is always 
either a fool or a physician!" " May'nt he be both. Doctor 1" was the arch rejoinder, with a most 
aich leer, and insinuating voice, half drawled out. " A vicar was once," (said his lordship,* presi- 
ding at the dirmer of the Admiralty sessions) " so wearied out with his parish clerk confining himself 
entirely to the 100th psalm, that he remonstrated, and insisted upon a variety, which the man pro- 
mised ; but old habit proving too strong for him, the old words were as usual given out next Sun- 
day, ' All people that on earth do dwell.' Upon this the vicar's temper could hold out no longer, 
and, jutting his head over the desk, he cried, ' Damn all people that on earth do dwell !' — a very 
compendious form of anathema," added the learned chief of the spiritual court." 

* Sir W. Scott was, durmg the latter years of his life, created a peer, by the title of Lord Stow- 
ell ; but it is by his former name that he is known to the profession, and to the world.

THE GAMEKEEPER'S FIRESIDE 



ISr I L I.r STRA TI OJf OF AN ENGRAVING ON STEEl. 



Mr. Hancock here represents a veteran Scotch gamekeeper, enjoying himself with his pipe, by 
his own homely fireside, in company with his dogs, who appeal to partake with him of the satisfac- 
tion attending a good day's diversion. From the bald head and wrinkled brow of this experienced 
sportsman, he must be nearly approaching that period which is called by the Psalmist " the ao-e of 
man ;" still, from, the muscular frame of his body, and the undiminished size of his limbs, it is evident 
that he has many more years' work left in him, the almost sm'e result of the health-giving pursuits 
he has followed, and the pure air he has breathed, since he breathed at all. 

The dogs here represented, are rare specimens of their sort. The one apparently the most at- 
tached to his master, is a fine Russian Setter, a breed much esteemed on the moors, from their ge- 
neral hardiness of constitution, and being less given to thirst than those of the English kind ; which 
is a great desideratum to the grouse shooter, in many parts of Great Britain, where good limpid 
water is sometimes not to be met with, in a beat of considerable extent. In their natural formation 
and effect, they are far from being the most beautiful and attractive of the canine species ; in fact 
they have neither that uniformity of shape, nor elegance of figure, which so much distinguish the 
English and Irish setter ; neither do they exhibit the pleasing variegation in color, which we find 
in them : — in short, their beauty may be said, in a great part, to consist in their ugliness, the true 
test of their pure blood being a long wiry coat, from which their heads are not even free, extend- 
ing beyond the eyes, nearly to their exclusion from our view, and oftentimes with a moustache which 
would satisfy the Great Mogul. There is also another point of difference between the breeds. The 
Russian generally stands to his game and dogs, after the manner of our pointer, which is an ad- 
vantage in a wide range of moors. This dog is also good as a retriever, and by no means shy of 
taking water. 

The dog lying down by the fire, is a portrait of a blood-hound, the property of the late lord 
Middleton, of WoUaton Hall, Nottinghamshire, England, who was celebrated for his dogs, of almost 
every description used in the field, — as well as for having been a master of fox-hounds during the 
greater part of his life, and considered a superior judge of the animal, (dog,) generally. The blood- 
hound, or Sleuthe-hound of the Scots, although a fine subject for the painter, is not a general favo- 
rite, from the character he bears of decided enmity to man ; for which he is indebted, not so much to 
his nature, as to a property ascribed to him, of pursuing human beings by their footsteps, and not 
quitting the scent until he has seized them, or marked them to their place of retreat. That there has 
existed, and does exist, a species of dog of this description, trained to discover the haunts of robbers

-and to trace the road of run-away negroes, there does not remain a doubt. We learn from Rains- 
ford's " History of St. Domingo," that they were trained to the scent of the human footstep, by being 
fed on blood, and rewarded at the end of their long chase, by being encouraged to pull down a figure 
^representing a negro, stuffed with the blood and entrails of beasts. On the authority of Slrabo, they 
.did more than this; they were made the means of attack, in a body, on the Gauls, and within our 
«own time, of bringing back the run-away negroes of Jamaica to their duty, having been hired, at a 
•great expense, from Cuba, for the purpose. But there is as much difference between the dogs now 
alluded to, and that which we call the English blood-hound, as there is between an English fox- 
hound and an Irish greyhound. In fact, we are well persuaded, that the animals hired on this oc- 
casion from Cuba, were, as nearly as possible, the sort of animal that the celebrated sportsman, Nim- 
rod, saw, and gave a description of, in his " German Tour," at the seat of Count Hahn, in Germany ; 
which are not altogether unlike the old Irish greyhound, with the exception of being possessed of 
still more power, as well as great apparent ferocity, — which indeed, they stand in need of, as they 
are used for the chase of the wild hog. It may be recollected by some of the readers of this work, 
that he described the way in which these boar-hounds, as they are called, were kennelled, to guard 
against danger to strangers. They were chained to the walls of a long gallery-like building, at a 
certain distance from, and opposite to, each other, only leaving a suflicient space for persons to walk 
between them, quite secure from their gripe ; for they were most of them savage, and exhibited sundry 
scars from the tusks of the beasts with which they had contended. 

When speaking of those dogs, he thus expressed myself as to their kind : " They seem to be a 
cross of the old mastiff and the lurcher greyhound, but with more power than belongs to each indi- 
■vidually ;" whereas, the old and true blood-hound is supposed to have sat for the picture which 
Shakspeare drew of the dog of the highest repute in the sixteenth century: — 

My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, 
So flewed, so sanded ; and their heads are hung 
With ears that sweep away with the morning dew ; 
Crook-kneed and dew-lapp'd, like Thessalian bulls ; 
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells. 
Each vmder each. 



Mr. Tickell, the friend and fellow-laborer of Addison, thus introduces the blood-hound, in his 
" Poem on Hunting," and with the full license of a poet : — 



Thy care be first the various gifts to trace. 
The minds and genius of the latrant race ; 
In powers distinct the different clans excel, 
In sight, or swiftness, or sagacious smell. 
By wiles ungen'rous some surprise the prey, 
And some by courage win the doubtful day. 
Seest thou the greyhound, how, with glance severe. 
From the close heid he marks the destin'd deer : 
How every nerve the greyhound's stretch displays. 
The hare preventing to her airy maze ; 
The luckless prey how treach'rous tumblers gain. 



And dauntless wolf-dogs shake the lion's mane 1 
O'er all the blood-hound boasts superior skill. 
To scent, to view, to turn, and boldly kill ; 
His fellows' vain alarms rejects with scorn. 
True to the masters' voice and learned horn. 
His nostrils oft, if ancient fame sing true, 
Trace the sly felon through the tainted dew ; 
Once snuff'd, he follows with unalter'd aim, 
Nor odors lure him from the chosen game ; 
Deep-mouth'd he thunders, and inflam'd he views, 
Springs on relentless, and to death pursues. 



We do not, however, wish to be understood to asseit, that a dog, known by the term " blood- 
hound," has not been made use of in Great Britain — in Scotland in particular, in the civil wars of 
Wallace and Bruce, for example, whose poetical historians relate very interesting anecdotes touching 
the service they rendered their masters ; as, likewise, on the confines of England and Scotland, where 
the borderers were continually preying upon the herds and flocks of their neighbors ; and in En- 
gland as well, in the early part of the last century, when deer-stealing prevailed so much, and was 
.accounted a capital offence. The celebrated Colonel Thornton, of Thornville Royal, Yorkshire, 
England, indeed, had a leash of these animals during his residence at Clapham, in Surry, within the 
.last half century, which were the terror of the neighborhood, partly from the name they bore ; — 
neither do I doubt that such dogs might have been, in the course of time, brought to hunt the dry 
foot of man, having been trained to hunt it when touched with something that left a strongei scent 
behind it. 

But we must not give credit to all the marvellous stories handed down to us of dogs and their 
/breeds. We read of those which were individually more than a match for the lion ; — perhaps it was 
in honor of the memory of one of this description, that Alexander the Great gave his name (Perditas) 
to a city ! Plutarch speaks of dogs of such courage as outstrips all we experience in our own breed 
of bull-dogs, forasmuch, as he says, they would suffer amputation of their limbs — aye, even of their 
_heads — rather than quit their hold ! ! 

_The two dogs on the right-hand in this picture, are what are called Deer-lurchers, in contradis-

tinction to the term Deer-greyhound, and pecuUar to Scotland. It is difRcuIt to define this variety 
of dog ; but we may conclude that he is mongrel bred, of great power ; and resembling those which 
we are' told pulled down sixteen bucks, one day after dinner, in Cowdry Park, Sussex, for the amuse- 
ment of Queen Elizabeth. In fact, the word " lurcher" is not definable by the sportsman, farther 
than that it implies a fault— that of running foul— for which a thorough-bred modern greyhound is 
certain to obtain a halter. Perhaps the canis Gallicus, which is spoken of by Ovid, and held in such 
estimation among the ancients for his pot-filling accomplishments, was much such an animal as this, 
" as inferior in make and symmetry," as the editor of the " Courser's Manual" observes, " to the 
modern greyhound, as tbe hog-maned top-heavy cobs, which served as Hobson's choice of models to 
Phidias and his brother sculptors, were to Sorcerer and the Darley Arabian." 

The following description of the lurcher is given by Laurence (not good authority) in a work 
called " Scott's British Field Sports," but acknowledged to be from his pen. " The lurcher, a breed 
some years since on the decline, is a mongrel fquere—ii a mong)-eI, how can he call him of any- 
particular breed 1 He should have said variety,) between the greyhound and shepherd dog, or the 
smaller and mongrel mastiff. He is a poacher's dog, or kept for the purpose of deception, under the 
pretence of not being of the hunting species. The lurcher will catch up hares in an enclosed coun- 
try, and some of them, though slow, will run long and well." Some years back, a gentleman la 
North Wales had a breed of greyhounds, very raw-boned and wiry-haired, and so far resembhng the 
lurcher in their propensities— indeed we may say excelling him— as to have been often known to go 
out by themselves, and, having killed their hare, to bring her home in their mouths. As we are al- 
ways shy of the marvellous, these dogs were well known in the neighborhood of Pwllheli, a small 
market town in Carnarvonshire. That there did exist several varieties of the greyhound, is a fact well 
established ; and that they chaced indifferently the fox, the hare, or the buck. They would, indeed, 
on the fattest and best buck in a herd being shown to them, pursue it by the eye, and if lost for a 
time, recover it by their singularly distinguishing faculty of sight, even should it have regained the 
herd ; but we have reason to believe the species is now lost, and the Highland greyhound is become 
very 'scarce. The last-named dog is of great size and strength, covered with long rough hair, and 
was much esteemed by the powerful Highland chieftains in their magnificent hunting matches. The 
Irish greyhound, used in the chase of the wolf, is not now to be found m this part of Europe— at all 
events he is become rare. 



THE SONGS WE USED TO LOVE 



BT CATHARINE H. W A T E R M A IT . 



There is a charm in music's breath 

To chase the shades of care. 
To bid the wrinkled brow of age 

A gleam of sunshine wear — 
A magic spell that makes us yearn 

Again in joy to rove 
Through those glad scenes where first we heard 

The songs we used to love. 

It brings us back our youth again, 

The sunny days of life. 
It strews fresh roses o'er our paths, 

With blooming beauty life ; 
The echo of a long loved voice 

Now swelling strains above. 
Comes whispering in gentle notes 

Through songs we used to love. 

We hear the stranger's careless lip 

The pensive numbers swell, 
And the quick fluttering of our hearts 

Attests its mighty spell. 



And tears — thick tears, we fain would hide, 

The power of memory prove, 
And we call back the days of yore 

In songs we used to love. 

The songs, the songs we used to love. 

Oh ! we remember still 
How oft their echoes sweetly stole 

Around the grass-crown'd hill ; 
Like viewless wings, by spirits borne, 
! They seem'd through air to move, 
Still flying faster than pursued. 

The songs we used to love. 

Then come, young spirit of sweet sound — 

Bright soother — bring again 
The faded days of long ago. 

In thy remember'd strain. 
And, hand in hand, mine early friends 

Again with me shall roTe, 
And t will be a child once more.

THE MAN THAT WAS USED UP. 

A TALE OF THE LATE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN. 



BT ZDGAE. A, POE, 



' I CANNOT just now remember when or where I first made the acquaintance of that truly fine-look- 
ing fellow, Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C, Smith. "Some one did introduce me to the gen- 
tleman, I am sure — al some public meeting, I know very well — held about something of great im- 
portance, no doubt — and at some place or other, of this I feel convinced — whose name I have imac- 
countably forgotten. The truth is — that the introduction was attended, upon my part, with a degree 
of anxious and tremulous embarrassment which operated to prevent any definite impressions of 
either time or place. I am constitutionally nervous — this, with me, is a family failing, and I can't 
help it. In especial, the slightest appearance of mystery — of any point I cannot exactly compre- 
iend — puts me at once into a pitiable state of agitation. 

There was something, as it were, remarkable — yes, reinarhuhle, although this is but a feeble term 
t o express my full meanmg — about the entire individuality of the personage in question. What 
this something was, however, I found it impossible to say. He was, perhaps, six feet in height, and 
of a presence singularly commanding. There was an air distingue pervading the whole man, which 
spoke of high breeding, and hinted at high birth. Upon this topic — the topic of Smith's personal 
appearance — I have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute. His head of hair would 
have done honor to a Brutus — nothing could be more richly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss. 
It was of a jetty black — which was also the color, or more properly the no color, of his unimagina- 
ble whiskers. You perceive I cannot speak of these latter without enthusiasm ; it is not too much 
to say that they were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun. At all events, they encircled, 
and at times partially overshadowed, a mouth utterly unequalled. Here were the most entirely even, 
and the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth. From between them, upon every proper oc- 
casion, issued a voice of suipassing clearness, melody, and strength. In the matter of eyes, my ac- 
quaintance was, also, pre-eminently endowed. Either one of such a pair was worth a couple of the 
ordinary ocular organs. They were of a deep hazel, exceedingly large and lustrous : and there was 
perceptible about them, ever and anon, just that amount of interesting obliquity which gives force 
to the pregnant observation of Francis Bacon — that " there is no exquisite beauty existing in the 
world without a certain degree of strangeness in the expression." 

The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I ever saw. For your life you could 
jiot have found a fault with its wonderful proportion. This rare peculiarity set ofl' to great advantage 
3 pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush of conscious inferiority into the countenance 
of the marble Apollo. I have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say that I never beheld them 
in perfection before. His arms altogether were admirably modelled, and the fact of his wearing the 
right in a sling, gave a greater decision of beauty to the left. Nor were the lower limbs less mar- 
vellously superb. These were indeed the ne plus ultra of good legs. Every connoisseur in such 
Matters admitted the legs to be good. There was neither too much flesh, nor too little — neither 
rudeness nor fragility. I could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the os femoris, and 
there was just that due gentle prominence in the rear of the fibula which goes to the conformation 
of a properly proportioned calf. I wish to God, my young and talented friend Chiponchipino, the 
sculptor, had but seen the legs of Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith. 

But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty as reasons or blackberries, still 
I could not bring myself to believe that the remarkable something to which I alluded just now — 
that the odd air of Je ne sais quoi which hung about my new acquaintance — lay altogether, or in' 
fleed at all, in the supreme excellence of his bodily endowments. Perhaps it might be traced to the 
vnanner — yet here again I could not pretend to be positive. There was a primness, not to say stiff- 
ness, in his carriage — a degree of measured, and, if I may so express it, of rectangular precision, at- 
tending his every movement, which, observed in a more petite figure, would have had the least little 
savor in the world of affectation,pomposity, or constraint, but which, noticed in a gentleman of his 



THE MAN THAT WAS USED UP. 67 

undoubted dimension, was readily placed to the account of reserve, of hauteur, of a commendable 
sense, in short, of what is due to the dignity of colossal proportion. 

The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in my ear, at the instant, some 
few words of comment upon the man. He was a remarkable man — a very remarkable man — in- 
deed one of the most remarkable men of the age. He was an especial favorite, too, with the ladies — 
chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage. 

" In that point he is unrivalled — indeed he is a perfect desperado — a downright fire-eater, and no 
mistake," said my friend, here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me with the mystery 
of his tone. 

" A downright fire-eater, and no mistake — showed that, I should say, to some purpose, in the late 
tremendous swamp-fight away down south, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians. (Here my 
friend placed his forefinger to the side of his nose, and opened his eyes to some extent.) Bless my 
soul ! — blood and thunder, and all that ! — prodigies of valor ! — heard of him, of course 1 — you know 
he's the man" 

" Man alive, how do you do ? why how are ye 1 very glad to see ye, indeed !" here interrupted 
the General himself, seizing my companion by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiflly, but 
profoundly, as I was presented. I then thought, (and I think so still,) that I never heard a clearer 
nor a stronger voice, nor beheld a finer set of teeth — but I must say that I was sorry for the inter- 
ruptionyws^ at that moment, as, owing to the whispers and insinuations aforesaid, my interest had 
been greatly excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign. 

However, the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. O, 
Smith soon completely dissipated this chagrin. My friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a 
long tete d tete, and I was not only pleased but really instructed. I never heard a more fluent talker, 
or a man of greater general information. With becoming modesty, he forbore, nevertheless, to 
touch upon the theme I had just then most at heart — I mean the mysterious circumstances attending 
the Bugaboo war — and, on my own part, what I conceive to be a proper sense of delicacy forbade 
me to broach the subject, although, in truth, I was exceedingly tempted to do so. I perceived, too, 
that the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest, and that he delighted, especially, in. 
commenting upon the rapid march of mechanical invention. Indeed — lead him where I would— 
this was a point to which he invariably came back. 

" There is nothing at all like it," he would say ; " we are a wonderful people, and live in a won- 
derful age. Parachutes and rail-roads — man-traps and spring guns ! Our steam-boats are 'upon 
every sea, and the Nassau balloon packet is about to run regular trips (fare either way only twenty 
pounds sterling) between London and Timbuctoo. And who shall calculate the immense influence 
upon social life — upon arts — upon commerce — upon literature — Vv'hich will be the immediate result 
of the application of the great principles of electro-magnetics 1 Nor is this all, let me assure you I 
There is really no end to the march of invention. The most wonderful — the most ingenious — and 
let me add, Mr. — Mr. — Thompson, I believe is your name — let me add, I say, the most useful — the 
most truly useful mechanical contrivances, are daily springing up like mushrooms, if I may so ex- 
press myself, or, more figuratively, like — grasshoppers — like grasshoppers, Mr. Thompson — about 
us and — ah — ah — around us !" 

Thompson, to be sure, is not my name ; but it is needless to say that I left General Smith with a 
heightened interest in the man, with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep 
sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age of mechanical invention. My curi- 
osity, however, had not been altogether satisfied, and I resolved to prosecute immediate inquiry 
among my acquaintances touching the Brevet Brigadier General himself, and particularly respecting 
the tremendous events in which he performed so conspicuous a part — quorum pars magna fuit—^ 
during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign. 

The first opportunity which presented itself, and which (horresco referens) I did not in the least 
scruple to seize, occurred at the church of the Reverend Doctor Drummummupp, where I found my- 
self established, one Sunday, just at sermon time, not only in the pew but by the side of that worthy 
and communicative little fiiend of mine. Miss Tabitha T. Thus seated, I congratulated myself, and 
with much reason, upon the very flattering state of affairs. If any person knew any thing about 
Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, that person, it was clear to me, was Miss Tabitha 
T. We telegraphed a few signals, and then commenced, sotto voce, a brisk tete d tete. 

"Smith !" said she, in reply to my very earnest inquirj'- ; " Smith ! — why not General John A, 
B.C.! Bless me, I thought you A;net« all about Aim/ This is a wonderfully inventive age ! Hor- 
rid affair that ! — a bloody set of wretches, those Kickapoos ! — fought like a hero — prodigies of valor — 
immortal renown. Smith! — Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.i — why, you know he's the 
man" 

" Man," here broke in Doctor Drummummup, at the top of his voice, and with a thump that came 
near knocking down the pulpit about our ears ; " man that is born of a woman hath but a short 
time to live — he cometh up and is cut down like a flower !" I started to the extremity of the pew, 
and perceived by the animated looks of the divine, that the wrath which had proved so nearly fatal 
to the pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself. Theie was no help for it— 



68 burton's gentleman's magazine, 

so I submitted with a good grace, and listened, in all the martyrdom of a dignified silence, to the 
"balance of that very capital discourse. 

Next evening found me a somewhat late visiter at the Rantipole theatre, where I felt sure of satis- 
fying my curiosity at once, by merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of affabili- 
ty and omniscience, the Misses Arabella and Miranda Cognoscenti. That fine tragedian, Climax, 
however, was doing lago to a very crowded house, and I experienced some little difficulty in 
making my wishes understood ; especially, as our box was next to the slips, and completely over- 
looked the stage. 

" Smith 1" said Miss Arabella, as she at length comprehended the purport of my query ; " Smith ? — 
why, not General John A. B. C!" 

" Smith 1" inquired Miranda, musingly. " God bless me, did you ever behold a finer figure V 

" Never, madam ; but do tell me" 

*' Or so inimitable grace 1" 

" Never, upon my word ! — but pray inform me" 

*' Or so just an appreciation of stage effect 1" 

"Madam!" 

" Or a more deUcate sense of the true beauties of Shakspeare 1 Be so good as to look at that 
leg!" 

" The devil !" and I turned again to her sister. 

•' Smith 1" said she, " why, not General John A. B. C! Horrid affair that, was'nt it 1 — great 
wretches, those Bugaboos-^savage and so on — but we live in a wonderfully inventive age ! — Smith"? 
— O yes! great man ! — -perfect desperado — immortal renown — prodigies of valor ! Never heard! ! 
(This was given in a scream.) Bless my soul I — why he's the man" 

" mandragora, 

Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world. 
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep 
Which thou owd'st yesterday !" 

here roared out Climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in my face all the time, in a way that I 
couldn't stand, and I wouldn't. I left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately, and went behind the 
scenes for the purpose of giving the scoundrel a sound thrashing. 

At the soiree of the lovely widow Mrs. Kathleen O'Trump, I was very confident that I should 
meet with no similar disappointment. Accordingly, I was no sooner seated at the card table, with, 
my pretty hostess for a partner, than I propounded those questions whose solution had become a 
matter so essential to my peace. 

♦' Smith V said my partner, " why not General John A. B. C! Horrid affair that, wasn't it 1 — 
diamonds, did you say 1 — terrible wretches, those Kickapoos ! — we are playing whist, if you please, 
Mr. Tattle — however, this is the age of invention, most certainly — the age, one may say — the age 
par excellence — speak French 1 — oh quite a hero — perfect desperado ! — no hearts, Mr. Tattle ! — I 
. don't believe it — immortal renown and all that — prodigies of valor ! Never heard.'.' — why, bless 
me, he's the man" 

*'Mann 1 — Captain Mann 1" here screamed some little feminine interloper from the farthest cor- 
ner of the room. " Are you talking about Captain Mann and the duel 1 — oh, I must hear — do tell 
— go on, Mrs. O'Trump ! — do now go on !" And go on Mrs. O'Trump did — all about a certain 
Captain Mann who was either shot or hung, or should have been both shot and hung. Yes ! Mrs. 
O'Trump, she went on, and I — I went off. There was no chance of hearing any thing farther that 
evening in regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith. 

Still, I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill luck would not run against me for 
ever, and so determined to make a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching little 
angel, the graceful Mrs. Pirouette. 

" Smith 1" said Mrs. P., as we twirled about together in a pas de Zephyr, " Smith ? — why not 
General John A. B. C.l Dreadful business that of the Bugaboos, wasn't it"! — terrible creatures, 
those Indians ! — do turn out your toes, I really am ashamed of you — man of great courage, poor 
fellow — but this is a wonderful age for invention — O dear me, I'm out of breath — quite a desperado 
— prodigies of valor — never heard.'.' — can't believe it — I shall have to sit down and tell you — Smith ! 
why he's the man" 

" Man-fred, I tell you !" here bawled out Miss Bas-Bleu, as I led Mrs. Pirouette to a seat. " Did 
ever any body hear the like 1 It's Man-fred, I say, and not at all by any means Man-Friday." 
Here Miss Bas-Bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner ; and I was obliged, will I nill I, 
to leave Mrs. P. for the purpose of deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain poetical drama 
of Lord Byron's. Although I pronounced, with great promptness, that the true title was Man-i^ri- 
day, and not by any means Man-fred, yet when I returned to seek for Mrs. Pirouette she was not 
to be discovered, and I made my retreat from the house in a very bitter spirit of animosity against 
the whole race of the Bas-Bleus. 



THE MAN THAT WAS USED UP. 69" 

Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and I resolved to call at once upon my par- 
ticular friend, Mr. Theodore Sinivate — for I knew that here at least I should get something like de- 
finite information. 

" Smith ?" said he, in his well known peculiar way of drawling out his syllables ; " Smith? — why 
not General John A — B — C.I Savage affair that with the Kickapo-o-o-o-os, was'nt itl Say! don't 
you think so 1 — perfect despera-a-ado — great pity, 'pon my honor ! — wonderfully inventive age ! — 
pro-o-odigies of valor ! By the by, did you ever hear about Captain Manni" 

" Captain Mann be d d !" said I, " please to go on with your story." 

" Hem ! — oh well ! — toute la mcme cko-o-ose, as we say in France. Smith, eh 1 Brigadier 
General John A — B — C? I say — (here Mr. S- thought proper to put his finger to the side of 
his nose) — I say, you don't mean to insinuate now, really, and truly, and conscientiously, that you 
don't know all about that affair of Smith's as well as I do, eh ? Smith 1 John A — B — C.l Why^ 
bless me, he's the ma-a-an" 

" Mr. Sinivate," said I, imploringly, " is he the man in the mask ?" 

" No-o-o !" said he, looking wise, " nor the man in the mo-oo-on." 

This reply I considered a pointed and positive insult, and I left the house at once in high dudgeon, 
with a firm resolve to call my friend, Mr. Sinivate, to a speedy account for his ungentlemanly con- 
duct and ill breeding. 

In the meantime, however, I had no notion of being thwaried touching the information I desired. 
There was one resource left me yet. I would go to the fountain head. I would call forthwith upon 
the General himself, and demand, in explicit terms, a solution of this abominable piece of mystery.- 

Here at least there should be no chance for equivocation. I would be plain, positive, peremptory 

as short as pie-crust — as concise as Tacitus or Montesquieu. 

It was early when I called, and the General was dressing ; but I pleaded urgent business, and was 
shown at once into his bed-room by an old negro valet, who remained in attendance during my visit. 
As I entered the chamber, I looked about, of course, for the occupant, but did not immediately per- 
ceive him. There was a large and exceedingly odd-looking bundle of something which lay close 
by my feet, on the floor, and, as I was not in the best humor in the world, I gave it a kick out of 
the way. 

" Hem ! ahem ! rather civil that, I should say !" said the bundle, in one of the smallest, the 
weakest, and altogether the funniest little voices, between a squeak and a whistle, that ever I heard 
in all the days of my existence. 

" Ahem ! rather civil that, I should observe !" 1 fairly shouted with terror, and made off at 3- 

tangent, into the farthest extremity of the room. 

" God bless me, my dear fellox," here again whistled the bundle, " what — what — what — why 
what is the matter "? I really believe you don't know me at all." 

" No — no — 710.'" said I, getting as close to the wall as possible, and holding up both hands irj 
the way of expostulation ; " don't know you — know you — know you — don't know you at all I 
Where's your master ]" here I gave an impatient squint towards the negro, still keeping a tight- 
eye upon the bundle. 

" He ! he ! he ! he-aw ! he-aw ! he-aw !" cachinnated that delectable specimen of the human 
family, with his mouth fairly extended from ear to ear, and with his forefinger held up close to his 
face, and levelled at the object of my apprehension, as if he was taking aim at it with a pistol. 

"He! he! he! he-aw! he-aw! he-aw! — what, you want Mass Smif! Why, dar's him !" 

What could I say to all this — what could IV I staggered into an arm-chair, and, with staring: 
eyes and open mouth, awaited the solution of the wonder. 

" Strange you shouldn't know me though, isn't it 1" presently re-squeaked the bundle, which I 
now perceived was performing, upon the floor, some inexplicable evolution, very analogous to the 
drawing on of a stocking. There was only a single leg, however, apparent. 

" Strange you shouldn't know me, though, isn't it 1 Pompey, bring me that leg !" Here Pom-- 
pey handed the bundle a very capital cork leg, all ready dressed, which it screwed on in a trice, and 
then it stood upright before my eyes. Devil the word could I sa3\ 

" And a bloody action it ivas," continued the thing, as if in a soliloquy ; " but then one musn't 
fight with the Bugaboos and Kickapoos, and think of coming off with a mere scratch. Pompey, 
I'll thank you now for that arm. Thomas (turning to me) is decidedly the best hand at a cork leg ; 
he lives in Eace street, No. 79 — stop, I'll give you his card ; but if you should ever want an arm, 
my dear fellow, you must really let me recommend you to Bishop." Here Pompey screwed on an 
arm. 

" We had rather hot work of it, that you may say. Now, you dog, slip on my shoulders and 
bosom — Pettitt makes the best shoulders, but for a bosom you will have to go to Ducrow." 

" Bosom !" said I. 

" Pompey, will you never be ready with that wig 1 Scalping is a rough process after all; but 
then you can procure such a capital scratch at De L'Orme's." 

" Scratch !" 

" Now, you nigger, my teeth ! For a good set of these you had better go to Parmly's at once 



70 

high prices, but excellent work. I swallowed some very capital articles, though, when the big Bug- 
aboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle." 

" Butt end ! — ram down ! — my eye !" 

" O yes, by the by, my eye — here, Pompey, you scamp, screw it in ! Those Kickapoos are not 
so very slow at a gouge — but he's a belied man, that Dr. Williams, after all ; you can't imagine how 
well I see with the eyes of his make." 

I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me was nothing more or less than my 
new acquaintance, Brevet Brigadiei General John A. B. C. Smith. The manipulations of Pompey 
had made, I must confess, a very striking difference in the appearance of the personal man. The 
voice, however, still puzzled me no little ; but even this apparent mystery was speedily cleared up. 

" Pompey, you black rascal,'' squeaked the General, " I really do believe you would let me go out 
without my palate." 

Hereupon the negro, giumbling out an apology, went up to his master, opened his mouth with 
the knowing air of a horse jockey, and adjusted therein a somewhat singular looking machine, in a 
very dexterous manner, that I could not altogether comprehend. The alteration, however, in the 
whole expression of the countenance of the General was instantaneous and surprising. When he 
agam spoke, his voice had resumed the whole of that rich melody and strength which I had noticed 
upon our original introduction. 

" D — n the vagabonds !" said he, in so clear a tone that I positively started at the change, " d — n 
the vagabonds ! they not only knocked in the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut off at 
least seven-eighths of my tongue. There isn't Bonfanti's equal, howevei, in America, for really 
good articles of this description. I can recommend you to him with confidence, (here the General 
bowed,) and assure you that I have the greatest pleasure in so doing." 

I acknowledged this kindness in my best manner, and now took leave of my friend at once, with 
a perfect understanding of the state of affairs — with a full comprehension of the mystery which had 
troubled me so long. It was evident. It was a clear case. Brevet Brigadier General John A. B &gt; 
C. Smith was the man was

FAIRYLAND 



The Fairyland of our correspondent is not ortliodox. His description differs from all rtceived accounts of tlie 
country— but our readers will pardon the extravagance for the vigor of the delineation. 



Dim vales — and shadowy floods — 
And cloudy-looking woods. 
Whose forms we can't discover 
For the tears that diip all over. 
Huge moons there wax and wane — 
A gain — ag ain — again — 
Ev'ry moment of the night- 
Forever changing places — 
And they put out the star-light 
With the breath from their pale faces ; 
About twelve by the moon-dial 
One, vaore filmy than the rest 
(A sort which, upon trial, 
They have found to be the best) 
Comes down — still down — and down 
With its centre on the crown 
Of a mountain's eminence, 
While its wide circumference 
In easy drapery falls 
Over hamlets, and rich halls. 
Wherever they may be — 
O'er the strange woods — o'er the sea — 
Over spirits on the wing — 



Over every drowsy thing — 

And buries them up quite 

In a labyrinth of light — 

And then, how deep ! O ! deep ! 

Is the passion of iheii sleep ! 

In the morning they arise, , 

And their moony covering 

Is soaring in the skies, 

With the tempests as they toss, 

Like almost any thing — 

Or a yellow Albatross. 
They use that moon no more 
For the same end as before — 
Videlicet a tent — 
Which I think extravagant: 
Its atomies, however, 
Into a shower dissever, 
Of which those butterflies 
Of Earth, who seek the skies, 
And so come down again, 
(The unbeheving things !) 
Have brought a specimen 
Upon their quivering wings.

CHAPTERII. 

THE HASTY W O R D.— T H E PARTING. 

Forget it, oh forget the sound 
That had such fatal ])Owcr to wound ! 
It was not meant to deeply dwell 
With such a dark and witlieringspell ; 
It was not meant to give a pain 
'Iliat kind tones could not heal again. 
A hasty word will sometimes start 
From out an overburdened heart. 
That tears, however fast they fall, 
Can ne'er again its sound recall ; 
And time, as still it onward rolls, 
Divides yet irore the once knit souls, 
Until the heart is o!ily stirred 
With memory of a hasty word. 

Miss C. H. IVaferman. 

For some moments the cousins were silent. To a third person it would have appeared quite a 
cene. The young De Berrian stood gloomily apart. He was a boy in years, but under a somewhat 
saddened demeanor, indicating a maturity of thought beyond his age — he hid the fire and haughti- 
ness of a high-born southron. It is no comfortable thing — a flat rejection — for there is no humilia- 
tion so resourceless as that of personal vanit_y. Pride humbled has its balm in the " soul" — but 
wounded vanity, like a butterfly beaten down in a shower, only soils its wings the more when it 
tries to fly. 

Catharine looked as smiling as a Hebe, for at first she wickedly enjoyed her lovers chagrin ; yet 
she felt for him ; her own pride, and she had a plenty, vs'hispered the scorn of a refusal. She would 
not have forgiven another of her sex who had rejected her noble cousin. Ah ! the archer's feathered 
messenger of sighs was on the air, and the aim was fatal. Her splendid eye languished behind their 
lashes strung with stealing tears. The roses, while and red, were vanquished by turns upon her 
cheeks, and her frame thrilled with the luxury of maiden fear as she thought " how delightful it will 
be to chase away his frowns ! Fll smile my sweetest, for oh ! this must be love !" Alas that our best 
resolves are often a moment too late ! There is a fatality in every passing minute, and the traveller 
often hurries to the shore but in time to see his bark adrift. 

Catharine did smile her sweetest, for her look was the tender charity of an angel. " Tell me, 
Knight of the Rueful Visage," she asked in tones of heavenly consolation, " why standest thou here 
forlorn? Hast basely left the college tilt and tournament for the bower of thy lady-lovel " 

&lt;' I am happy, exceedingly so, that I have something gratifying to tell you," answered Walter, 
with a bitter expression of pleasure — " I am expelled." 

" Expelled ! Walter De Berrian expelled! for whatl my dearest cousin," cried she feelingly, as 
she took his burning hand, and looked with tears into his face, 

" For fighting a duel," was the stern and measured reply. 

The vision that paled before him haunted De Berrian for years through the moan of the sea and 
the stillness of the night-watch. Slowly her white hands pressed away from her ashy face the ring- 
lets that would have hid its anger. She drew herself up, and scanned the astonished youth as if 
meditating whether he were worthy a curse. He would have given worlds to have recalled his 
reckless speech, for the withering gaze of the imperious and indignant Catharine was freezing his 
young heart. 

" And you have dared," she spoke at length in wildest scorn, " to lay at my feet the insulting 
love of a duellist ; you would lead me to the holy altar with a hand of blood — wreathe the brow of 
Catharine Harmair with bridal flowers that hide a murderer's steel ! Leave me sir, forever." 



72 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

The first soft pencilling of the rising moon fell upon her face, before so beautiful in its coquettish 
play ; but now it was pale and stark as of one who has met the shaft of death in the utterance of a 
curse. She turned away with a gesture of eternal parting, and desolation fell upon her unhappy 
cousin as when the leaves of the almond faint at the sweep of the desert's breath. Nothing in feel- 
ing is so intensely miserable as the shrinking wretchedness of the young heart before the gloom of 
a hopeless future. Starting distractedly, as a mourner denied at the prison gate, the young man 
caught his stately cousin by the arm, and wildly implored her thus — 

" Hear me but a moment, unjust Catharine, for, by Heaven, I go as you bid me. When your 
brother and mine was taken away, you bowed to the woe of blighted promise — the misery of cheer- 
less loveliness — oh ! by that remembrance I plead a moment's hearing ; for the grass is long on my 
mother's grave, who loved you no less than me — I am alone ; for your curse — yes yours — is yet 
ringing on this air. Why is love — devotion — a crime 1 Why am I, who never breathed your name 
but as a votary at his shrine, spurned with words too damning for the doom of a fiend ] It is hard 
when our feelings, our weaknesses, are slighted by the indifferent ; but when our dearest hopes are 
scorned by those we love, it is more bitter than a dishonored grave — Catharine, my cousin and play- 
mate, forgive me, for I go forever." 

" Go, and never again may my eyes light on one of that hated class that murdered my brother." 
" Yet that brother was a duellist." 

"Leave me, leave me, never speak to me again !" she wildly shrieked. 

" Never," slowly repeated De Berrian, folding his arms, more in sorrow than in anger, at the dan- 
gerous perversity of his adored cousin. She deigned not a look, but moved haughtily off; and then 
the fiery pride of his nature flashed in Walter's stem deey) eye, and the blood of a lofty soul that 
scorns to clear up a causeless wrong, hurried and tingled in his cheek. 

" Your lesson is bitter but well taught. Miss Harman. I can be as proud and unbending as you, 
for the Harman blood runs here in a heart as easUy taught to hate as your own. Yet my hands are 
stainless. It was my glory to love you honorably. You have conquered, but never triumphed ; for 
Brutus goes not bound to Kome. I am young," continued De Berrian, in the fulness of his injury, 
" and the world was beautiful before me. I felt within a soul of honor and love, and woman was my 
idol. Give me affection and happiaess,! said, and fame will haunt me not; for even in ambition's 
wildest flight there are pauses when the fairest theme of fancy's muse is a cottage and a wife. Of- 
ten when I have seen two trusting hearts twining together in the delicious confidence of wedded 
bliss, where fond eyes read each other's longing, and warm lips met to print it in a blush, I have 
said with the rapture of untried hope, ' I too will one day be like one of these.' I could have lived 
and died a gentleman and a benefactor, but that dream is past, and the hand of Catharine has lifted 
the veil." 

No answer was made. Not a softening look or swimming tear told the youth that he was for- 
given. In lofty silence the cousins threaded the moonlit grove, and walked towards the house, their 
tall shadows falling before them as dark as the future to each. 

The gouty old papa was in the most forbidding temper. He had seated himself with a pipe in the 
piazza, and his ailing foot, redolent of camphor and penniroyal, and flaming in regimentals of flan- 
nel, was cushioned on a high-backed chair. The. soft odor of the many flowers that Catharine had 
taught to twine along the railing and pillars stole sweet around with dew and moonlight, and 
soothed the martyr to gentility in spite of his gout. He was in a fair way to pass an hour without 
an oath, and wanted but a kiss from his daughter to be perfectly etherealized. The veteran was a 
famous hunter of foxes, and kept a community of hounds. He was, too, a lover of cats — a thing 
unusual with his sex, and singularly startling considering his antipathy to virgins of the old school. 
Now cats and hounds are mortal foes ; with them every look is a national reflection ; they are sparring 
day and night, not unlike a maiden aunt and a romantic miss when a lover is in question. Sudden- 
ly, an animated bark and a furious rustle in the shrubbery, nearly jerked the old gentleman from a 
sleepy obtuse to a stark right angle. It was the opening of his favorite hound, who, in a moment, 
was wheeling and dodging in full cry. The old hunter felt himself bounding over hedge and ditch, 
neck or nothing, on a clear frosty morning. Smacking his pipe by way of a horsewhip, he clapped 
his hand to his mouth and rung a lusty whoop, when his favorite cat, with his favorite hound in 
full chase in her wake, doubled the corner handsomely, and bore down the piazza under every rag 
of canvas. The fleet Grimalkin, being of clean run and lighter draught, hauled her courses, and 
made harbor under the chair that supported the rebellious limb. Instantly her long pennant was 
run up, and she opened a broadside of fire at the enemy beyond the chevaux-de-fris e. The defiance 
was mutual, and, in the desperate cutting out, the chair was capsized, and the unlucky foot fell by 
the board in the hottest of the fight. The fierce Grimalkin, like some brimstone pirate with whom 
every strange sail is an enemy, threw her grapnels aboard the helpless prize, and a furious melee for 
possession ensued. Snaps, squalls, and clapper-clawings, in the earnest interchange of feline and 
canine courtesy, were showered on the fated foot — a lesson to all mediators. The old gentleman 
howled and swore tremendously, for he never did either by halves, and the staggered belligerents 
threw national honor to the devil, and made hasty sail with colors struck. By this time, the silent 
cousins were coming slowly up the walk. Seeing a stranger with his daughter, the wrathy old 



THE PRIVATEER. 73 

gentleman swore less, and rounded off his last period as they approached. Catharine retreated 
without a word into the house, and Walter made himself known to his uncle. Neither was in the 
sweetest humor, and the interview was the essence of formality. 

" You return somewhat unexpectedly," hemmed the uncle, with a grim glance at his bedraggled 
foot. 

" I have left college," responded the nephew with a bow that would have done honor to an am- 
bassador. 

" Left sir ! Left — when you were to graduate in a few months ! I don't remember that you con- 
sulted me on the occasion" — and the uncle put an arm akimbo, and thrust his lips together till they 
might have been mistaken for a piece of putty that had accidentally fallen on a gravel walk. 

"Nor I, sir — the formality of your advice was dispensed with. I am expelled," was the courteous 
reply. 

" Expelled ! hillo !" sung out the uncle, grabbing at his crutch. " How dare you sir ? hey — 
what for, sir V 

" When you question me in a more gentlemanly manner I will answer. Pray keep your tem- 
per — it will aggravate your pain. I regret that I so rashly communicated the distressing intelli- 
gence ; you are not equal to it," advised the affectionate nephew, as his uncle almost jumped out of 
his seat. 

" High times, by Jupiter — you penniless dog ! — ^jawed in my own house 1 what am I coming to?" 
thundered the old gentleman, stamping the wrong foot in his rage. 

" Penniless dog !" shouted De Berrian, as a terrible frown gathered on his blackened brow, " ha ! 
then this is the secret of my kind reception elsewheie," glancing at the agitated Catharine, who had 
hurried to the door. He stood erect and haughty before his astonished guardian. " When, sir, my 
dying mother gave her orphan son to her only brother's care, her pure soul was happy in its flight, 
for your tears bespoke protection. I thank God she witnesses not this humiliation. Farewell for- 
ever." 

The young man wheeled away fiom his stupified uncle with a burning brain. As he neared the 
shrubbery, Catharine stretched her arms imploringly towards him, and hoarsely sobbed his name. 
The recall was never heard, and she pressed her hands upon her bursting forehead in a fearful strug- 
gle of pride and i egret; her long magnificent hair fell darkly on her cheeks, and hot tears trickled 
fast between her tapering fingers. 

Walter stood by the tree where, an hour before, in the dream of hope and thrill of love, he met 
his beautiful cousin after an absence of years. Her fawns came skipping to meet him, and fled 
frightened at their mistake. De Berrian bitterly laughed, and strode to the bank of the bay. The 
sails of the distant ship loomed bright in the moonshine like a tall bank of floating snow. A large 
flag, which arose and fell with a caressing breeze, appearing and vanishing as a thing of air, seemed 
to call him on. The ship was tacking towards him, and springing suddenly into a frail batteau, he 
plied the oars with a muscular arm. Soon his white and beautiful home, the grassy-green play- 
ground of his boyhood, the shore, the cliffs, and every well-remembered spot, were blended, softened, 
lost in the broad wake of the moon, rippling iir a thousand smiles at the wooing of the gentle gale. 
A gruff voice hailed De Berrian from the bov? of the ship, and shooting his boat alongside, he 
climbed actively over the gangway. And that gifted youth — that orphan boy — in one short hour 
was robbed of all of life except its bitterness ? 

The next evening was gay and lovely as May and light hearts could make it. The birth-night 
ball was a brilliant affair. The lighted and embowered promenades, the garden, pavillions of vines 
and roses, the piazzas, halls and saloons of the Harman mansion were echoing to music and revelry. 
Youth and beauty were teeming there in all their freshness and witchery, and the queenly and ac- 
complished Catharine was the star of every eye. She played and sung, and the lips of beauty 
hushed their ravishing converse to hear the melody of a Seraph. She flashed in the witty tete-a-tete, 
and tongues were silent before her that elsewhere dropped the brightest gems of thought. And when 
she moved in the magic elegance of the dance, airy and graceful as one of those exquisite shapes 
that float in a half-remembered dream, every eye worshiped her, and not a heart around but sighed 
when the music ceased. 

Catharine Harman stood before her mirror that night, and a lovely female friend unfastened the 
jewels in her superb hair, which the restless beauty tossed and flung in splendid negligence. That 
evening had been one of intoxicating triumph, and Catharine seemed in the highest spirits. Yet 
there was a wildness in hei gayety, an unnatural thrill in her frequent laugh that startled herself. 
The eye was too rapid and unearthly in its brilliancy ; the cheek too flushed, or, rather, the whole 
face wore that deep scarlet tint that tells of feverish excitement. How strange that the breaking 
heart should mock itself by the counterfeit of spirits ! The wild and bounding stream hurries only 
to exhaust itself — though the sunlight plays on the summer cloud, there is trouble in its bosom, and 
a shadow behind. 

The lovely friends had laughed long and gayly over the incidents of the ball. They had nearly 
finished their graceful task of disrobing ornaments from beauty that needed not their help, when 
Catharine abruptly asked — 



74 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" Do you know, Isabel, the secret of a woman's power over these boasting lords of creation'?" 

"I must ask you," she answered, " experience teaches well." 

" Not another compliment to-night, sweet innocence. Their lightness has already etherealized your 
unambitious Kate — but yes, I will take yours up on second thought ; for, coming from one of the 
sex, sure it is a priceless curiosity." 

" Then be generous as I, and give me the secret." 

"If you promise not to rival me, dearest," said the winning Catharine, softly pressing a hand on 
each cheek of Isabel, and kissing a pair of Ups almost as tempting as her own. " Like the strength 
of Sampson, the spell of a woman's enchantment lies in her hair, her rich, curling, magnificent hair. 
What are your swimming eyes, without their moleskin brows and camel's hair lashes "? Just ima- 
gine what the bewitching face and elegant head of yours would look like, were it shorn of its sunny 
dress of ringlets ! Ah ! Isabel, this is Cupid's own ambush, and see here !" she added, flinging the 
long, dancing curls over her friend's white and beautiful bosom, and turning her to the mirror, 
" there is nature's most lovely sight, beauty unadorned. Oh ! if our husbands could not love us for 
ourselves, then indeed is love a phantom." 

"Indeed, Catharine," laughed the amused and flattered Isabel, " beside affording a fatal ambush to 
the puissant boy-god, I think too that female hair furnishes him with his vaunted silken chains. M'^hen 
we were sweet, friendship-swearing sixteen, I think I saw such a chain on the wrist of your bashful 
cousin — when will he be home again 1" 

It was well that her unbound tresses shaded the instant paleness of her countenance, else Catha- 
rine had betrayed the intense emotion the question elicited. " I thought he might have been here 
to-night," she answered in a quivering tone. 

An hour after, when nothing was heard but the gentle breathing of the sleeping Isabel, Catharine 
had stolen from her arms, and mingled her tears with the dew of the flowers that hung heavy with 
their sweet burden in the windows. Long and bitter was that reverie. The crowded incidents and 
giddy eclat of the past day had shut out reflection, or rather she had sought their excitement through 
dread of thought. But in that still hour when the moon taught gentleness, and the stars led memory 
home, she thought of her wronged cousin. It was the hour when the heart owns its truth. Truth, 
Uke echo, dwells in solitude, startling with her floating whisper the burdened soul that seeks her 
communion. He was gone forever! "Will he comeback"? will he forgive me?" she almost 
shrieked — " O I will pray the stars for tears — the dove for her imploring glance to plead a pardon ; 
and then he is lord of this heart forever. He said he loved me! Ijove! mysterious power. I 
knew thee not before." She ceased, for the moon was sinking under the dusky line of the far-off 
shore ; her shadow fell like a long still pillar of light across the sleeping bay, and then all was dark, 
still, and mystic. 

One who trifles with affection is like the too envious seer who peers over the cavern's brink, hold- 
ing only a slendor switch. Love is the frail and beautiful flower reared in a lady's boudoir. Ten- 
der as the hand that caresses its leaves, it blooms the type of its lovely priestess. Sighs are its dew 
and its summer wind. A flower so fleeting, yet O ! so exquisitely prized, perishes at the out-door 
blast. 



CHAPTERIII. 

THE PORT— THE SAILING OF THE SEA-GULL. 

It was an autumnal mom in 1812, and the domes, towers and steeples of the monumental city 
loomed bright and glancing above a sea of vapor, like distant ships becalmed. Here and there groups 
of roofs and chimneys, frowning with smoke, and port-like windows were anchored, like floating bat- 
teries, on the white expanse. The fire-wand of the magician Sun touched the heavy canopy ; it 
folded grandly up, and the city stood awake. A rambling noise of far off wheels and bells gathered 
depth and distinctness till the eternal roar of the crowded mart floated on the chilly morning air. — 
Yet it was not all the bustle of trade. The shrill music of the pipe, and the rolling tones of the 
drum lent an echo to the passing aii. Hundreds of flags were hanging around and afar, from the 
heights and shipping ; but they were not the peaceful telegraphs of commerce, for when the buoy- 
ant breeze unfurled their blazoned folds the banner of stars and stripes was proudly flung alee. 

War had been declared between Great Britain and America. A billow of that tremendous storm 
that had lashed Europe into foam, had strayed across the Atlantic, and drowned the lights of peace 
along the coast. The spirit of a brave people had risen from vain fury at unprovoked aggression to 
a noble consciousness of equality, A chivalric eagerness for the contest at once pervaded all classes 
of the people ; for already the iron thunder of the Constitution had rolled across the deep to tell the 
proud court of St, James that a rival star was shining on the sea. 

"business was at a stand, yet every body was busy ; thousands of citizens were thronging the streets. 



THE PRIVATEER. 75 

Behind the ample flags that flaunted over them, the distant observer might note the soUd ranks and 
even tramp of the military. The port was alive with boats passing and hailing. A few bay-craft 
were standing up, which were boarded by the curious and idle, who for once were determined to be 
astir for the good of the country. Every arrival seemed freighted with the destiny of the nation, and 
a large crowd, hungry for news, stood upon the wharves. Now and then a burst of artillery was 
heard, which called forth vast shouting and vociferous patriotism. The, splendid and unexpected 
victory of the Constitution had elated a people " unused to conquest and'tocertain of their own 
powers." Every soul was ready to fight — no matter what — the devil, or any thing in general — yet 
all had an especial hankering to cuff" the stout corporation of old John Bull on his vaunted ocean 
home. Nor was this " all talk and no cider," for they of the monumental city have gathered laurels 
on hard-won fields, and their fleet cruisers, in distant seas, have overhauled and downhauled many 
a flag of the enemy. The brave will ever honor and reward valor, else whence that proud title " Mo- 
numental 1 " 

A short distance from the wharf, at the lower part of the city, lay a small half-brig, half-schooner- 
looking craft, which at a glance fastened attention by the surpassing beauty of her model. She was 
of that peculiar and singularly elegant class well known in American ports as an hermaphrodite 
brig. Her masts were tall and wand-like, with narrow shrouds, and a beautiful rake ; her white 
tapering spars were bright and clean, and her rigging throughout was in tasteful and elegant style. 
She sat long and low in the water, and swung with the breeze as gay and Ught as a floating plume. 
A single white streak of paint, clear and even as if cut out of pearl, swept, with a scarcely percepti- 
ble curve, along the dark leaden hull, and a small snowy sea-gull, with crouched neck and half ex- 
tended wings, seemed readyto fly from the ornamented bow. There was a flourish of golden sea- 
grass on her handsome stern, which was almost brushed by the long stripes of the United States' 
flag as it flaunted over the taffrail. Four port holes on each side revealed the black mouths of as 
many cannon ; a long eighteen pounder was poised upon a pivot abaft the foremast, and two ports 
for stern chasers opened on each side of the wheel. A pilot signal was flying at the fore. 

The appearance of the vessel was that of a privateer, and the bustle and hurrah of recruiting disci- 
pline which a seaman's eye quickly detects, attached her at once to that daring and somewhat equi- 
vocal class. Her officers were brave and skillful, and she was manned by a choice crew of nearly 
one hundred men, whom patriotism, oj the more seductive spirit of gain, had drawn together. 

Privateering has been quaintly called " a school of piracy," and probably with some truth ; but it 
is no prejudice to say that American privateers in the late American war are a noble exception. The 
navy was small as it was gallant, and private armed vessels might rather have been regarded sharers 
of the national defence than speculating plunderers. It is well known that they paid their respects 
to all vessels of the enemy, making no invidious distinction between armed and unarmed. Many 
gallant men played at that biilliant game from the purest national feeling ; and what American, 
when reading the history of their daring victories in the last war, would withhold the meed of ap- 
plause and gratitude 1 

But now there was a sudden stir on board the Sea-Gull. The boatswain's whistle split the air, 
and the loud " all hands up anchor," startled a gallant airay of blue jackets to their duty. The nu- 
merous boats that had crowded around the brig put off, and cloud after cloud of clean new canvas 
boomed gladly in the gale. With a graceful careen to leeward, she glided like magic away. The 
drum and fife struck up a stirring march, and a long and thrilling shout burst from the admiring 
crowd on the wharves. She clipped it beautifully past the fort, her happy flag waving recognition to 
the large ensign that presided frowningly over the batteries. Another shout — a whiff" of smoke from 
the deck — a single gun — and the Sea-Gull was away on the wave.

A SKETCH FROM LIFE. 



OF WILMINGTOIf, If. C. 



A FEW years ago, I resided for a short time, during the summer months, in the little village of 
P******, the borough-town of one of the central counties of that unpretending state, to which the 
name of Irving's sleeping hero is now most usually applied. It was a retired place. There was 
little of the stateliness and pride, the gloss and tinsel show of more frequented spots. The surround- 
ing country could boast no grand imposing views, yet the scenery was indeed lovely and picturesque. 
It heeded the murmuring music of no Tivoli to give it interest, the blaze of no ^tna to lend a richer 
or more glowing tint to its skies. The prospect was one the eye delights to dwell upon. No ap- 
pearance of the elaborate efforts of Art was visible, but all was clothed in the sweet simplicity of 
Nature's garb. To a mind such as mine, the quiet seclusion of the neighboring groves, vested in their 
own thick foliage, was always inviting. I was one the world might suppose habitually gay, yet was 
it otherwise. At times dark and burning thoughts crowded through my aching brain. I withdrew 
from the society of my fellow man, and rejected with embittered heart his proffered sympathy. Then 
did I love to wander forth alone, to breathe the free air of the hills, crowded with verdure ; to listen 
to the rich melody of the feathered warblers, for they could soothe my gloomy feelings and divert 
from their rough channel my fevered thoughts. Among the many retreats of my melancholy, there 
was one peculiarly a favorite, but a short stroll from my dwelling. It was the humble cottage of a 
faithful servant, who had numbered more than a century of years ; now sheltered in his decaying age 
by the affectionate giatitude of his master's only representative. Him, when a boy, he had often 
fondled on his knee and breathed for his welfare his simple prayer, with that purity and intensity of 
feeling that came from the heart. There was a wildness about his home that made it deeply in- 
teresting and romantic. Around his little dwelling, constuicted comfortably yet without reference 
to taste, the luxuriant grass spread its tapestried freshness, and three or four giant oaks, veterans as 
himself, over its moss-covered roof had interwoven their branches, as if with solicitude to guard him 
from the heat of a southern sun. A few paces in the rear, embedded in a thicket of plum trees, was 
a modest grave, scarcely now to be distinguished. Above it the yellow jessamine hung in graceful 
festoons, filling the air with its exquisite fragrance, while the white rose, sweet-briar, and honeysuckle, 
clustered in loveliness, appeared here and there through the interstices of the shrubbery, as if to tempt 
the heedless stranger to the perilous adventure of reaching them. Such was his choice for the re- 
treat of his declining years, near the mouldering remains of a master whom he ever tenderly re- 
membered, and expected to join in a happier world with the mild piety of the christian's hope. For 
the last twenty years of his life he had seldom passed the immediate limits of his little farm. His 
wants, which were few, were weekly supplied from the village by the filial attention of a grandson, 
who had now attained the age of manhood, and his store of luxuries increased by contributions of 
his favorite weed from visiters, and the small presents I found it in my power occasionally to supply. 
In the worn outlines of a form attenuated and bent by the ravages of time might be detected the 
vestiges of a once athletic and vigorous frame. The presence of some he scarcely noticed, but me 
he always met with the smile of younger days. He was one of the few remaining links connecting 
the present and the olden time. Seated by his side, I have often listened with eager joy and throb- 
bing heart to his many stories. He would seek to beguile my visits with all the wonted garrulity of 
old age — tell me of our fathers — paint the scene in which they moved in the strong color of 
truth. There in {he distance, where the country court-house once stood, he would point out the 
spot where the haughty Briton dared to plant his tent on freedom's soil; — where his own cottage 
rose, encamped the patriot force. With kindling eye, he would trace the hasty retreat — the spirited 
pursuit, and the well-contested though unequal fight of the allies — the startling danger of a too gal- 
lant master, and his own successful efforts to rescue him, while the tear of remembered triumph stole 
down his furrowed cheek. Much to my regret, parental commands soon called me away. I visited 
before leaving, for the last time, my old friend. He bade me farewell with touching earnestness — he 
said we would never meet again, and I felt, as feelings of sorrow stole over me, that his words were 
true. I left him with a kind adieu and small gift. iTven now his last words, " God bless you, master," 
seem to ring in my ear. Three years afterwards, I returned to the same little town, and soon was 
on my way to my favorite haunt. The little path I had so often trodden was overgrown with rank 
weeds — where once stood his house was a mournful pile of rubbish. But, by the grave I had often 
visited, one of more recent date told the story of his end— old Richard was no more. May the turf 
rest lightly upon him ! Peace be to his ashes ! 



THE PAST AND THE FUTURE 

A DREAM. 



ELDER, COLUMBIA, PA. 



The busy world was still. The solemn moon 
Smiled forth her silvery beauty ; and the stars, 
Like living diamonds on a sea of glass, 
Danced in the sapphire canopy of heaven : 
Night, robed in the rich Autumn's mellowness. 
Kept pace with the deep slumber of the world. 
And fell upon the waters aird the fields 
With the full majesty of silence ! Dreams 
Now came upon my slumbers ; and methought 
Of the grand enterprise with which a world. 
Boundless — limitless as the far stretch of thought, 
Was by creative Deity wrought up 
And fashioned into being. How the mind, 
(That vivifying principle wliich spurns 
The trammels which have bound the body up 
In the deep silentness of sleep,) will leap 
Through the dim vista of ethereal spheres. 
And draw such portraiture of things, they seem 
The very shadows of reality ! 
Thus were my dreams the faithful limners of 
All that is bright and beautiful in this 
Luxuriant world which is. 

And thus, methought. 
The chronicled events of times gone by 
Rolled past me in their gorgeousness of glory. 
The world was then unbuilt: Chaos was there — 
Dressed in our twilight's dappled mantle : God 
The ever-pure, the ever-glorious God — 
The ever-living, self-existent God — 
Throned in the bosom of immensity, 
Held all secure the eternal destinies 
Of worlds unborn ; and he alone filled up. 
With his infinitude of perfectness. 
The whole of animate existence, which 
Had else been but a blank. Full of the fire 
Which mortals here call purity, whence love 
Springs like a spark of glory in the heart, 
This great, high God, conceived the grand design 
Of building worlds and peopling them with men. 
The image of himself, whose " end and aim. 
And ultimatum" were the joyous land 
Which he himself inhabiteth — where Love, 
In-dweller of that happy land, abides. 
To fill each heart with bliss and full delight ! 
Methought old chaos smiled when passed abroad 
The mandate from God's holy sanctuary ! 
Oh ! what a flash of glory then burst forth ! 
Then, all at once, and out of nothing, came 
World after world, and moving onward still. 
Each, with the fitness of design perceptive. 
Into its or\ rolled. Light flashed abroad. 
And then the hl^h-arched firmament was spread, 
(A gorgeous canopy whose jewelled top 
Only the infinite could e'ev conceive,) 
XiVe a rich banner flashing golden beams. 



Clouds, sporting in the depths of living space, 
Blushed with the rosy tints of dazzling light. 
And hung like drapery round a bridal couch 
Which mortals revel on in orient climes. 
Earth, and the thousand beauteous worlds that 

moved. 
Each in the place by God's appointment given, 
Were by the great Designer now reviewed. 
I saw God's eye, and quailed beneath the blaze 
Of never-dying glory that shone forth ! 
I heard his voice, and echo bore the sound 
To heaven's remotest limit ; and the words 
Were written on the great white throne of God, 
In lines of fire, — " The work is tert good !" 
******* 

A change came o'er my dream. Mankind had 

played 
Their Uttle hour upon the stage of time, 
Had had their griefs and joys, their loves and fears, 
And now were mouldering in their silent cells 
Where thought was chained in dumb forgetfulness. 
Before me was the future — what a book 
For man to contemplate ! upon its lids 
I saw the marks where curious hands in vain 
Essayed to tear the fetters which bound up 
From human ken that page of beauteous die — 
All but one glorious leaf that had contained 
The rules which erst were given to man, writ 

down 
By inspiration in the Book of Truth ! 
Now, one by one, the seals were all unloosed, 
And full before me was the volume spread, — 
The Future was revealed ! 

Oh ! glorious sight ! 
Too fair indeed for view of mortal man, 
Except in visions of the silent night. 
There was the throne of God — from out its base 
Flowed the pure river of eternal life. 
Which shone like crystal burnished o'er with fire ; 
And from whose flowery banks, on either side. 
Nodded that tree whose verdant branches bore 
Twelve kinds of fruit which ripen every month. 
The voice of Deity went forth, and, lo ! 
The trump resounded and the dead arose — 
And they, and all that dwelt upon the earth, 
In the quick twinkling of an eye were changed ! 
Oh, how each heart rejoiced I Each face now 

beamed 
With that rich glow which burns for ever bright, 
(For each was now " immortal as his sire,") 
And full of smiles, and love, and pure dehght. 
Millions on millions of that glorious band. 
Sent forth a shout which shook the throne of God, 
And as its echo rung through boundless space — 
My sleep was broken, and the vision gone ! 



HALF AN HOUR 
IN THE ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS 

AT PHILADELPHIA. 



PHIIADELPHIAX. 



It is a hot morning, and we have been strolling in Chestnut street to refresh our fancy with the 
various female wonders of Nature and Art, with which every great city abounds. We have not, it 
must be confessed, been very successful in our search, for Chestnut street we find is losing very de- 
cidedly the character for high fashion which it once enjoyed, and Walnut street is beginning to 
usurp its best glories. There is no place in the world where fashion (we allude to the selectest) is 
so sensitive, or capricious, as in Philadelphia : the moment that a place is so attractive or so well 
known that " every body" is supposed capable of going there, and the frequenting of it ceases to be 
a distinction, that instant it is pronounced vulgar, and people of ton fly from it with horror. In con- 
sequence of this foolish fastidiousness the most agreeable places in this city, (as Washington square,) 
are entirely in the hands of second or third rate persons. Our Chestnut street walk has therefore 
brought us little but a red-hot face and pair of dusty boots. Now the only cool place in Philadelphia, 
when the weather is hot, is the Academy of Fine Arts ; we will, therefore, drop in there for a few 
moments, to regain our due personal solidity, and amuse our sight by turning from painted faces to 
painted canvas. 

When we recover from the astonishment produced by the appearance of an enormous pile of 
plaster in the centre of the outer room which seems placed there for no other purpose than to pre- 
vent a single picture from being seen at the proper distance, and to injure the sight in judging of 
colors, the first thing that engages our attention is Alston's huge painting of the dead man restored 
to life, by touching the corpse of Elisha, (catalogue No. 46.) The painter is what the cant of the 
times denominates " a native artist," and it is therefore a high offence against patriotism, honor, 
good feeling, and the seven cardinal virtues in a lump, to bestow on the performance any thing else 
than " honied words of praise." Phew ! The delineator of such a monstrossity aught to be rolled 
up in his canvas, and both of them burnt together on the altar of beauty. 

The taste which selected this subject for the pencil was unacquainted with that strict boundary 
line within which the graces have encircled this art. Pleasure is the sole end of painting; beauty 
is the sole source of unqualified pleasure : beauty then is the supreme law of this, and all the other, 
arts of design. The Greeks I take to be the despotic law-givers for the world in all that concerns 
art : they painted, not to display their skill or exhibit a resemblance, but to produce an object whose 
loveliness should gratify the spectator. Impression, which most modern artists seek, was not their 
aim ; beauty was their constant Latium ; and if they ever selected subjects of a tragical nature they 
softened down the terror under the control of beauty. Laocoon in Virgil shrieks with the wdld horror 
of irrepressible agony : such an emotion would in stone be too violent to give pleasure, and the ex- 
tended mouth would have been ungraceful ; in the sculpture, therefore, theie is nothing seen of this 
but what Sadoleto has called, " the stifled sigh of anguish." When Timanthes painted the sacrifice 
of Iphigenia, he drew a veil over the father's face ; not from inability to represent his giief in 
adequate power, for the more violent the emotion the more strongly are the features disposed, and 
the more easy, in consequence, is the painter's task ; but because the deep passion of that deadly suf- 
fering would have carried him beyond the bounds of beauty. Let me fortify my position by the 
authority of Winkelmann : " There are some sorts of sensation," says the best of all modem critics, 
" which are displayed in the countenance by the most shocking contortions, and throw the entire 
figure into postmes so violent that all those lines ot grace, which its forms evolved when its dis- 
position was tranquil, are destroyed. These passions the ancients either avoided entirely, or repre- 
sented them under such modifications as admitted a certain proportion of beauty. The images of 
Tage and despair deformed none of their works. Anger was subdued into severity. Jupiter hurling 
thunder was, va. the verse of the poet, furious with indignation ; in the marble of the sculptor he was

only grave," According to the poetical tradition, Love made the first trial at the fine arts : and the fable 
of the birth prefigured the history. The matter was deemed worthy of the interposition of government ' 
and a well-known law of the Thebans commanded the exclusive imitation of the beautiful, and punished 
by a fine the delineation of any thing offensive to the sight. A Greek epigram records, with high 
commendation, that a painter refused to portray a cei tain man because he was ugly; and the triumph 
of the portrait-statue was limited to those who had three times borne the lauiel, that the chances of 
an ill-looking subject might be small. Pauson, alone of Grecian painteis, selected deformed and 
hideous objects, and he passed his life in abject poverty. Aristotle strongly advises that no young 
person should be allowed to see his works, that their imagination might be filled only with beauty. 
It is a striliing illustration of the truth of our remarks, that among all the works of ancient art, re-- 
corded or remaining, statues, bas-reliefs, and pictures, not a single representation of a Fui-y is to be 
found. If these principles be just, Mr. Alston and his putrefactions perish together. I will venture 
to say that if this picture had been shown in Athens, the people would either have shivered it into 
threads as Jerdan did Maclise's Soane, or a law would have been passed for its suppression. 

Modern designers forget that they are artists as well &amp;s painters ,- they do not perceive that their 
profession is not simply to represent nature, but to represent it according to the laws of art.* To 
paint merely for impression or resemblance, without reference to the inherent spirit of the craft, is 
entitled to as little praise as a musician's imitation of a storm without regard to harmony and the 
laws of his instrument. The Greeks and the Germans are almost the only people who have appre- 
ciated the high value of art, for art's sake ; and have perceived the high and peculiar pleasure arising 
from the mere manner of description or representation, quite independent on the beauty of the thing 
described. Half the charm of a Greek ode springs from seeing with what skilful grace the poet 
moves beneath his fetters — how dominant are the laws of art — how imposing is the thraldom of 
genius working out its self-defined task — how nobly severe is the conscience of taste. It is the per- 
ception of high artistic talent that makes the prose of Suckling, Walpole, and Beckford, so fascinating, 
and renders Gray the favorite poet of the scholar. Mr. Alston has no^bowed under this flowery yoke. 

On another ground we disapprove this painting. The artist can exhibit but a single moment of 
time and a single point of view, and his production, moreover, is to be often examined, and long 
dwelt on. The portrait painter should therefore seize that expression of the face which is the most 
strictly natural, which is the centre and hinge of every other phase of the countenance, to which 
every phase can be referred and from which all can be derived : the historical painter should select 
that moment of the story which is the most pregnant with future meaning, and leads on to higher 
and higher interest ; the most elevated point of excitement should not be chosen, but the prelude to 
it. A common artist in Greece painted Medea slaying her children : Timomachus more wisely showed 
her meditating their death. Something must be left to the fancy, or else pictures become lifeless, 
and the art ceases to be poetic, and becomes meanly mimetick. The sculptor of Laocoon chisels a 
sigh ; imagination superadds a shriek ; had he exhibited a shriek, imagination could do nothing. The 
business of art is to stimulate interest, not satisfy it. Now Mr. Alston has seized a passion and a 
state of it which admits of no progression of wonder ; the next moment and a second glance will 
destroy it. There is no climax of emotion, no aggrandizement of interest : there is no future to the 
story; the present comprises and concludes all : the drama is fairly over, and the excitement ended. 
Had he shown us a fiend or giant thus rising on his astonished enemies, we should have been chain- 
ed in expectant interest; now there is nothing to follow ; the next instant will unknit the corrugated 
brows of the bystanders, and turn surprise to simple joy. The subject in fact is poetical and noi 
pictorial ; but as the painter did select it, he should have shown us the dead man rising before the com- 
pany were aware of it, so that we might be arrested in wonder as to what they would think when 
tiiey perceived the miracle. 

We cannot help suspecting Mr. Alston of a bit of sly satire in representing the wife in tears at the 
recovery of her husband ; one remembers the lines of Byron in Don Juan ; 

Tears shed into the grave of the connection 
Would probably salute the resurrection. 

If the painter merely meant to show us a picture of life just revived, as the poet of" The Giaour" 
has given us one of existence just departed, his failure is signal. On all hands it is a miserable piece 
of business, alike disgraceful to the artist, the academy, the city, the state, the nation, and the world; 
and even reflecting some discredit on the universe. 

Let us turn then from this work of native genius, to some of the foreign pictures, which are aroynd 
us, of which the only valuable ones are those collected by Mr. Powel in France, during the revolu- 
tion of the barricades, and by his permission now in the academy.

80 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

flere we have the Cecilia of Guido, (No, 37.,) said to be the original. It may be so, and if it is 
so, it is the most valuable picture in America, for Guido's Cecilia is vvorld-famous. On comparing 
Morghen's engraving of the veritable original with this one, some variations, especially in the turban, 
are perceptible; and the proprietor may be compelled to resort to the convenient supposition of pos- 
sessors, that his is a duplicate by the same great master. It is assuredly an exquisite picture, and no 
artist could regret the imputation of its authorship. The rapt and almost insensible posture of an 
enthusiast communing with the spirit which maddens it, has never been better exhibited. The 
ebandmi of the person, without either stiffness or ungracefulness, — the awful stillness of every fea- 
A^^e. in the repose of intense excitement, — the moody air of the countenance as of one past the first 
^tage of enthusiasm, which is glad aspiration, and attaining the last, which is masterless possession 
by the o'er-swaying presence — the merger of personal in spiritual emotion — the Hstlessness of one 
^&lt; over whom her Immoitality broods like the day, a master o'er a slave," of one " that, deaf and silent, 
xeads the eternal deep" of harmony, " haunted forever by the eternal mind" of music, — all this is in 
the highest style of genius, and quite sets the painter on a level with the poet. Guido's creation 
xealizes all that Wordsworth has conceived of 

That serene and blessed state 
In which the affections gently lead us on 
Until the breath of the corporeal frame 
And e'en the motion of this human blood 
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep 
In body, and become a living soul. 

The whole state and attitude of this figure presents itself to our mind as such a simple and har- 
rmonious whole, that we can scarcely persuade ourselves that it has been elaborated by the successive 
additions of partial labor, — that it was "the mellow fruit of toil intense." One thinks of the question 
ef the Esquimaux woman when standing in the dome of St. Paul's, " was this thing put here, or was 
it made 1" 

Turn we to this " Holy Family, after Raphael D' Urbino" — or, as it should be called, the meet- 
ing of Mary and Elizabeth, (no. 15.;) — a fine gala-day picture, — like a Persian morning in summer, 
bright and brilliant, wildly joyous and splendidly glad. The colors are fresh, and a little glaring; 
but time will take care of that matter. The siory goes that the copy was made for the Duchess of 
Berri, and ere the oil was dry she was obliged to leave Paris, and the painting being exposed to sale, 
Mr. Powel became the possessor. The artist, being a secret adherent of the exiled party, refused to 
give up his name for fear of displeasing the citizen king. 

This picture calls to mind the notion of Byron, or Browne, of the music of a beautiful face. The 
forms are disposed in comminghng curves, with such liquid grace, — the dark and manly face of 
Joseph and the age-brown and care- withered, yet pleasing, countenance of Elizabeth relieve so har- 
moniously the young and glowing cheeks of all the rest, — that musical, is the epithet that at once 
occurs to every spectator. The expression has been chaiged with a false license of metaphor, but 
it is strictly true to the laws of mind , and if metaphysics ever come to be written by a man who 
knows how to think, it will be stated that all sensations and impressions — thoughts, sounds, odors, 
and all others — present themselves to the mind as images ; and, being homogeneous, may of course 
be compared. Go over an overture in your own mind, and you will find that it is a picture. I went 
many years ago, to see old Beethoven, and found him sitting before an enormous instrument, which 
he called his piano-organ, consisting of an organ with a bankof forte-piano keys above, of which the 
wires were at the side, — an affair of his own contriving. He was in gloiious spirits, and resuming 
his seat at my request, begged me to choose a subject, then exclaimed immediately, " wait, I'll play 
you a Cathedral ; it shall be Strasburgh, for I know it by heart : and I will do what Napoleon me- 
ditated, for my cathedral shall have both towers." He began; planting the solid masonry with the 
deep tones of the organ, and running out the tracery at the same time with the gay notes of the 
piano. Every limb of the old gentleman was in action ; both elbows frequently on one instru- 
ment, while the fingers were on the other ; he held also in his mouth a wand, which he called 
his tongue-finger, shod with lead enough to weigh down any of the organ-keys on which it fell, and 
this he directed with astonishing success. I can only say that I recognized every part of his musical 
structure, and felt the same emotions which the present building had excited. 

The face of the infant Christ is an exhaustless field for pictorial genius ; for it is capable of being 
charged with a thousand different yet appropriate expressions. In Raphael's vision of Sextus you 
have as much mere intelligence in the countenance as the soft features of youth will bear : in this 
you see nothing but the glad animal delight of a boy rushing to the aims of his mother. I confess 
that in no painting have I found that blending of divinity with humanity, in the pictured counte- 
.nance, which belonged so mysteriously to the real character. 

What magnificence of color in that Madonna by Sussoferald ! (16) The sky of Italy is le.ss 
" darkly, deeply, beautifully blue" than that splendid band above the head. Yet the face, though you 
ccannot take exception to a single feature, has something of cold and wily in its beauty : that part of

the coloring may perhaps have faded. No painter, I suspect, ever fully succeeded in representing 
personal beauty, or, never gave satisfaction to all by his attempts ; and this by the necessary defect 
of his art. Let us stop a moment to compare the power of the painter and the poet in the exhibi- 
tion of female beauty. 

The poet operates by the description of effects, and these are universal ; the painter by the exhi- 
bition of causes, and these are particular ; the former are uniform in character, the latter are various 
in influence ; the first shall meet the sympathy of all, the second touch the feelings of only a part. 
When the poet tells us of the impression which his Genevieve produces on his heart, every reader 
can appropiiate the emotion to himself; each calls to mind the patticular lady whom he most admires, 
and the poem seems to him precisely and exclusively applicable to her; because the same passion 
has been felt by all, though produced by qualities as various as the nature of each. But of all these 
causes the painter is limited to a single set ; and what he places on his canvas can affect only that 
fraction of beholders who may happen to agree with himin definite notions of the highest beauty— 
a number in any case small, and farther narrowed by the power of moral qualities in warping the 
natural conceptions of ideal fairness. His most beautiful woman must be an individual ; she must 
be either of the Spanish sort, warm and impassioned, oi of Saxon blood, with azure eyes and flaxen 
hair, all light and smiles : and being such will not arrest the regard of one who has associated a difi. 
ferent style of face with all he knows of gladness or feels of love. This inferiority is inseparable from 
painting, because it belongs to the real objects. Herein lies the reason why nine persons out often 
are utterly disappointed in the illustrations of a favorite poet, notwithstanding the admitted excel- 
lence of the figures; from the bard we collect " a vision of our own, the treasured dream of time," 
and when we turn to the engraving we feel " that though 'tis fair, it is some other Yarrow." You 
read a popular Persian poem, and your sympathy with your author is complete ; you look at an ad- 
mired Persian painting and are outraged at seeing the eyebrows meet on the top of the nose. This 
then is the amount of the differences between the provinces of the arts ; that painting may acciden- 
tally be more decided in its impression, but poetry must essentially be more universal in its appie- 
ciation. 

It is the business of every artist to ascertain the strong points of his art, and develope them with 
all his ability. From the distinction which we have deduced, we infer that the poet is availing him- 
self of the full advantages of his art, then, only, when he describes persons by impressions and not by 
delineations, and that when he individualizes his pictures of beauty he leaves his tower of strength, 
and accepts the fetter of a rival. This test distinguishes the artistic skill of poets with nice success, 
and in fact draws a line between the very highest class of artists and all others. When Byron makes 
all his descriptions portraits, we must conclude either that he did not understand his art with con- 
summate delicacy, or that if he did, the strong pleasure of evolving his own personal impressions was 
" the fatal Capua for which he lost the world, and was content to lose it." Shakspeare manages the 
matter differently ; he never describes the appearance of his heroines, but the archeressis detected by 
her penetrating shaft. Who knows whether Ophelia had blue or black eyes, or who can tell whether 
Desdemona's hair was ebon or hazel ? When we see Othello bursting from the strong tangles of his 
doubt, as she looks round on him, and exclaiming with impressive fervor, " Perdition seize my soul 
but I do love thee !" and when we behold even the steeled murderer intoxicated by her sweet breath, 
then it is that we realize what a rich pearl she was. Of Cleopatra even, whose historical character and 
traditionary qualities might have seduced a less rigid artist, we have nothing but such gorgeous gene- 
ralities as " Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety." Sadi might object to a 
blue eye, and Scott to a black one, but Jew, Turk, Heretic, and Infidel bow alike before this grand 
impression. Look, too, at old Homer ; what do we know from the poet of the face or form of her who 
*' for nine long years had set the world in arms 1" Have we any thing about the " bright, black eye," 
the dimpling cheek, the glossy hair] Not a bit of it. " She was the most beautiful woman in the 
T?orld," says Homer, and there's an end of it. But when we see the cold and hoary sages of the 
council rising to look after her as she leaves the room — when we reflect that she was all that Venus 
could contrive, all that Paris could demand, all that Menelaus wished for — when we remember that 
for her Achilles struck, for her great Hector died — then we feel how wise was the forbearance of the 
poet, and how superior is poetry when rightly managed, to the best performance of the painter. We 
see Helen as we see the wind ; only by the commotion which her presence occasions. Ah ! those 
old fellows knew what they were about. 

What a darling picture is this of the marriage of St. Catharine (No. 4.) by Parmegiano I the 
darling' st of the darling kind. It is too exquisite to criticize : but I shall dream of it to-night. 

A fine Madonna is this ! (No. 81 ;) there is a subdued and sacred air about it which is good; it is 
a prayer-book picture. By " Corregio" says the catalogue; sed quaere de hoc. I know too well the 
value of Corregios in Europe, ever to expect to see one of this size in any cis-Atlantic collection. 
To account for its being here, a story is told of its having been concealed in one of the Royal galle- 
ries at the time of the " distribution bill" of the allies, by having a frame of stucco work wrought 
over it, and being sold when those galleries were thrown open by the mob. Unfortunately I am " one 
of those lank rascals," as Savage says, " who will never agree upon any thing but doubting." I 
should call it a fine copy ; a fine picture it certainly is, and when it hung in the gallery of the pro- 



82 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

prietor, in whose princely mansion it had a small room to itself, was well lighted by a single large 
window, and was capable of being seen at a becoming distance, it must be allowed that it exhibited 
much of what Sterne calls " Corregiosity ;" the figures seemed to float in the air like the filmy forms 
of the valley gossamer. 

Here are a couple of landscapes, or woodscapes, by Ruysdale, (Nos. 65. and 79.) which it is worth 
■while to walk forty miles any day to look at. There is a depth of perspective and a precision of 
natural representation which are wholly wonderful. " Landscapes are the pcculi^ir subjects of the 
painter," says Lessing, " and the poet should never attempt them, for his business is with successive 
incidents, not contemporary circumstances." Not quite so fast. Not facts, but the perception of 
them concern art : it is quite true that in point of fact the painter shows you the whole scene at once; 
but as the perception of it is by successive parts, it stands, in relation to the spectator, precisely on a 
footing with description. That when the details have been studied, th« whole may be viewed in 
mutual dependency, is an advantage on the side of painting; that when the whole has been under- 
stood, the parts in a second reading may be again contemplated separately, and successive perception 
again be enjoyed, is in the favor of poetry ; the latter has also a superiority in being able to illustrate, 
and especially to shade and color, by the aid of moral emotions, of which " Cooper's Hill" is a ca- 
pital instance. Lessing says that action, and not description, is the poet's true stiength, and he says 
justly. But he was not aware of the resources of a consummate artist ; he did not know that by re- 
presenting a diversified landscape, not as it stood, but as its various features rose upon the mind, all 
the spirit of action might be imparted to description. The most successful example of this which I 
am acquainted with, is Pope's* moonlight scene, in the eleventh book of his translation of Homer. 
We are supposed to be looking through the eyes of some actual spectator; every thing is shown in 
leference to him, and by a figure of Berkleian boldness the scene is exhibited as rising into existence 
according as it is consecutively observed by the looker-on. 

Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise, 
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies. 

Surely to transform description into creation without oflfending taste, and to bring a new domain 
tinder the sceptre, not by distorting the arm, but by transporting the transmuted field, is the triumph 
of art. Wordsworth and Coleridge having adopted an absurd system whose existence required the 
overthrow of Pope, have ridiculed the passage which I have alluded to, as melodious nonsense ; but 
both of them understood the meaning and motive of the poet, as little as they understood the beauty 
of modesty. Poetry never won richer laurels than when Sandy Pope fought her battles ; and he never 
conducted a more brilliant enterprize than when he vindicated description from the charge of dull- 
ness. A less striking instance of the same manoeuvre may be found in Milton ; " straight my eye has 
caught new pleasures," etc. 

Let us give one glance to " Death on the Pale Horse," which stands in the next room. I have al- 
ways had a profound contempt for West, as the most common-place and wooden of painters ; but 
this figure compels admiration. It has not one quality of his usual manner ; and is the only thing 
on which his fame as a great artist can be established. It is a great conception ; — the face of a being 
naturally detestable and odious, yet elevated into somewhat of exalted dignity by the high commis- 
sion which he has from the Almighty ; — apaUing, but not malignant ; hideous, but not shocking ; hor- 
rible, but not disgusting. Yet the picture is a leap, not a flight of genius : in the filling up of the 
canvas, — in the unworthy idea of a particular death in the midst of a general wasting of the world, — 
we detest the essential meanness of West's imagination, — that innate grovelling temper from which 
he never long escaped. Almighty heaven ! when the incarnate spirit of destruction was galloping 
on his pallid courser over the earth robed in night, and his extended fists flashing hell-fires, and 
universal life was fainting beneath his deadly breath, was it a time to think of lions snapping at 
horses' noses, or bulls tossing boys 1 Faugh ! I could kick the unworthy corner out of the picture. 

But we came here to get cool, and must not allow ourselves to grow warm in anger. 

* Lessing quotes with triumph, what Warburton tells us of Pope's mature contempt for the pic 
torial essays of his own youthful muse ; but when he compared description to a heavy feast of sauces, 
he was certainly only condemning the manner usually practised. 



LOVE AND GOLD. 



B T MISS 



STEPHENS, 



One lovely night in May, 

When pearly moonbeams lay 
In flower-beds sleeping, 

And glittering dew-drop fell 

Down to the green wood dell, 
Blue violets steeping ; 
A veil of pure and silvery mist 

Lay soft on forest tree and plain, 
And quiv'ring o'er still waters, kissed 

Their sluggish waves to life again. 

The slender brooklet sped 

O'er cresses in its bed, 
With mellow chiming, 

And lulling breezes sung 

The glancing leaves among, 
Like spirits rhyming. 
And in the still blue sky there came 

Stars show'ring down their golden light. 
Like bursting buds, or gems of flame, 

Set burning in the biow of night. 

That eve, a smiling elf 

Stole out to rest himself. 
Where vines unwreathing 

Form'd green and dewy bowers 

He heaped a couch of flowers. 
With odors breathing. 
Young Cupid piled his bed full high ; 

His cherry lip was bright with glee, 
A dimpled cheek, a sapphire eye. 

And a mellow laugh, the rogue, had he. 

His graceful bow unstrung 
Beside the boy was flung. 

In careless seeming ; 
And darts were scattered round 
Upon the dewy ground. 

Like jewels gleaming. 
Love sweetly slept — his weary wing 
Lay folded o'er his dreamy head. 
Like rainbow fragments scattering 
Their brightness o'er his scented bed. 

And like a sunny ray, 
His empty quiver lay ; 

Around it clinging 
Were tiny silver bells. 
Hid under rosy shells. 

With magic ringing. 



As Cupid slept, each slender tongue 
Breathed out a sweet and silver sound. 

As if ten thousand fairies sung 
Amid the rustling leaves around. 

Far more than half the night. 

Young Love — the roguish wight — 
Lay sweetly dreaming ; 

When one, with silent tread, 

Stole softly to his bed. 
The moonlight streaming 
L^pon old Mammon's clouded eye, 

The sloney look and brow of care, 
Made the beholder wonder why 

He should have sought a shelter there. 

Tuneless became each bell. 

Whose low and wailing knell 
Was faintly dying ; 

Each blossom closed its cup, 

Folding its odors up. 
And sweets denying. 
Young Love spread out his wings to rise, 

And left his rosy cheek all bare ; 
With dimpled hands he rubb'd his eyes, 

And shook the buds from off his hair. 

The youngster idly lay, 

Spurning the flowers away, 
With drowsy feeling ; 

A leg and foot of snow. 

With warm blood melting through, 
The while revealing ; 
When Mammon, with a crafty joy. 

Drew forth a chain of massy gold. 
And rudely bound the struggling boy 

Most firmly in its glitt'ring fold. 

There panting on the ground, 

With golden fetters bound. 
Poor Love lay crying, 

With tear-drops in his eye, 

His wings all droopingly 
Around him lying. 
Cupid was slandered much of yore. 

But he is less a fool than knave ; 
In truth, it was not long before 

A proof of this — the rogue ! — he gave.

He would not feel despair, 

E'en under Mammon's care ; 
So, quick resolving, 

He wept upon his chain — 

Like ice in pleasant lain, 
The gold dissolving, 
Fell sparkling brightly o'er his bed ; 

Then up the laughing Cupid sprung, 
Out from his blooming arbor fled, 

And shook his wings and gaily sung : 

Think ye to fetter Love with gold 1 

Ah, no, no ! 
"With brow of care and features old, 
With pulseless veins, and bosom cold 1 

Ah, no, no ! 

Enchain the star 
That gleams afar. 



Withhold the leaves from the tree ; 

Forbid the heart 

To act its part, 
Then hope with gold to fetter me I 



Could Love a humble captive be 1 

Ah, no, no ! 
The heart is Cupid'.s monarchy ; 
No gold is in his treasury. 

Ah, no, no ! 

Ambition bold, 
Piide stern and cold, 

Are subjects, Mammon, for thy chain ; 
But Love is free 
As thought can be, 

And flings thy shackles back again I

And this is the vast sea. 
That spreads its ample bosom 'neath our gaze ; 

This the great deep that we. 
In speechless rapture, look upon and praise ! 

Emblem of mighty power, 
Whose heaving breast circles the globe around ; 

Type that dost still endure 
To shadow forth the infinite profound. 

How beautiful and bland 
2s its smooth aspect, and its murmuring flow, 

As slowly down the land. 
Bright Phoebus sinks in rich and lustrous glow ! 

And buoyant on its breast, 
Dance the tall tapering mast and snowy sail, 

While from the fervid west 
The fanning breezes blow with gentle gale. 

But see, what glories rise ! 
The spotless moon, emerging from the main. 

Tinges with silver dyes 
The rippling wave that glances back again.] 



Surge upon surge rolls on 
In varied, soft, and pleasing harmony. 

As 'mid the mortal throng 
Successive myriads rise, and cease to be ; 

And as they cease, they rise 
In prouder, greater majesty and power, 

'Till mixing with the skies 
They end their fleeting being — and their hoar. 

Here ! to these haunts repair. 
Ye who, envelop'd in the city's heat, 

Languish for genial air, 
And sigh for blessings which you cannot greet. 

Lo ! countless blessings rise — 
Strength to the weary — balm for care and pain — 

Here health, with sparkling eyes, 
Enamor'd courts the freshness of the main. 

Bow 'neath the limpid wave. 
And dip your tresses in the dark blue sea ; 

And while the waters lave. 

Thank him who ocean gave — 
Meet symbol of his vast infinity.

CHAPTER VIII. 



(Continued from page 338, vol. IV.) 



It* Was In tlie lovely autumnal part of the j^ear when Thomas Girty and I started alone, with ou'^ 
^knapsacks on our backs, and our rifles on our shoulders, up the beautiful Miami Valley. It was our 
intention to continue as far as my deserted farm, and then hunt up north. We waded through the 
dry leaves, which prevented our shooting game, for the deer commonly heard us advancing some 
time before we were near enough to shoot them. The second day we came to the promontory over- 
looking my faim. It was the same from which I had beheld the blackened ruins of all I loved. My 
heart swelled with emotion, as I again looked upon the coals which lay scattered about where once 
stood my house, and where once I gazed with a father's pride, at my playing child — but all had 
■vanished, and where I once looked upon my family, and on the spot beneath which they lay, stood a 
iarge wolf, staring at us " with a brute unconscious gaze," while his white teeth shone in the sun 
like pearls. I don't know why it is, but I was seized with a sudden fit of madness at seeing a wolf 
on that sacred spot. I aimed my rifle at him and shot him; he sank in his tracks dead. Girty was 
well aware of the painful emotions which the sight below would kindle within me, and silently retired 
.some distance, and lay down upon the grass ; when the rifle fired he sprang to his feet, but upon 
looking at the dead wolf he immediately divined the feelings which caused me to shoot the animal, 
and lay down again. I went down to the ruins — the spot which I had dug for a garden the day 
previous to the catastrophe was filled with weeds, which grew rank and luxuriantly as high as my 
Tiead ; every thing looked gloomy — even the delightful landscape appeared to partake of the gloom 
■which hung over my once pleasant abode. The weeds had sprang up even within the small spring- 
house, and ground-ivy hung in sombre festoons from the roof. W^e tanied in that spring-house for 
some hours drinking the clear cold water and talking over our adventures. Girty dwelt long on the 
number of scalps we had taken since m}^ family was burnt, and spoke with hope of the approaching 
time when we would tear the reeking scalps,'even perhaps, he added, from those who had participated 
in rendering this delightful place a desert. He struck the right chord of my heart; for revenge had 
"taken the place of the love which was once there, and with a master hand he aroused those feelings, 
till I was eager for starting immediately for the nearest Indian town to lie in ambush and shoot the 
Indians. 

" Now you are fit for something," said Girty, as we arose to leave the spring-house. " These 
sorrowful thoughts," he continued, " will do for one to indulge in at times, but there are certain times 
4br every thing, and this is no time for harboring such thoughts, when we are uncertain what step 
2nay bring us among Indians, when 'tis necessary we should fight, and 'tis impossible for one to fight 
Ttvhen depressed in mind." 

I adopted Girty's opinion, and became more cheerful. We took a northern direction, and crossed 
the Big Miami river at a ripple, which has now washed many hundred yards lower, and soon came 
to the dense brush prairie ; here we killed the first game since we started. A large oak tree grew 
some distance to the right of our path, in passing which our attention was attracted by a rustling near 
its roots, and a large bear came out of the bushes, and looking neither to the right or left, rarr past 
Tis, and directly for a towering oak, which grew some hundred yards from where we stood. The 
singular awkward motions of the bear were ludicrous in the extreme, and instead of shooting him, 
3as would have been our first action, we both were seized with such laughter, that it would have been 
impossible. He ran so fast, and appeared so eager to reach the tree, that we both simultaneously 
looked from whence he came, knowing that he must be chased. We stooped in the bushes, and the 



THE MIAMI VALLEY. 87 

mystery was instantly solved. The largest panther I ever saw, leaped out from the bushes, and with 
fier^' eyes, and open mouth, bounded after the bear ; at every bound he cleared a space of at least 
twelve feet, and bruin soon began, by his clumsy and rapid motions, to evince signs that he was 
aware of his critical situation. I cocked my gun, but Girty caught my aim. " Don't shoot the pan- 
thei," he whispered, " for we will see some glorious sport ; the panther will kill the bear, and then 
wc may kill the panther with two loads — they are dangerous animals, you know" — at the same 
time giving me a look which reminded me of the wrestle I had with one of those dangerous animals. 
I uncocked the trigger, and we eagerly and silently followed to witness the fun. The bear gained 
the tree first, and scrambled up with a trepidation, which plainly proved he knew his life was ire 
imminent danger, and gaining a large fork, he lay down, and gazed upon his foe, which lay watch- 
ing him, like a cat watching a mouse. The bear licked his paws and appeared to think himself free 
from danger, and at length fixed himself for a comfortable nap, in the fork of the tree, but occasionally 
we observed, he would open one eye that his enemy might not steal a march on him. We were 
within twenty yards of the animals, and had an excellent view of all that was going on, and it was 
with the greatest difficulty Girty could prevent me from shooting the panther, for he lay at such a 
pretty distance ; but Girty, who thought more of the sport than the panther, held my arm firmly, 
while we looked at the panther and bear alternately, eager for the watching animal below to com- 
mence his ascent. After he had become thoroughly rested, the panther backed out about ten feet 
irom the trunk of the tree, and with one leap was as far up it. The bear was not so sound asleep, 
but he knew what was going on, and now scrambled up the tree with all the rapidity his clumsy 
motions would permit, and the panther followed hissing and spitting. To the very highest limbs the 
bear chmbed, where he set up a long howl, as he beheld the panther following close upon his heels. 
They were now at the farthest point of the top, and both on one limb, which bent and swungi be- 
neath their weight, till it began to crack. It was a thrilling sight to see two of the most dreaded and 
savage animals of the wilderness, battling on a small limb, which appeared to be three hundred feet 
above the ground. Girty jumped upon his feet, and yelled with excitement, while the animals were 
so busy holding on with one paw that they did not hear us. The bear squealed everj' time the pan- 
ther struck him, and the panther's hissing could be heard distinctly by us. The panther could not 
use his hhid claws, or poor bruin would have fared badly, still he fought so furiously with his fore- 
paws that the bear could not resist his energetic blows, and doubling himself up, till he appeared like 
a huge black ball, he loosened his hold, and came to the ground with tremendous force, breaking 
many limbs which would have impeded the passage of a heavy man. He bounce*! up at least three 
feet, regaining his legs, which he put into immediate and rapid use, and ran off for another large tree, 
some distance ahead. The panther was not far behind, for so soon as the bear had let go his hold, 
he ran down the tree with a rapidity which was astonishing, and reached the ground before the bear 
had ran fifty steps. They both passed within a few feet of where we were hid, but were so intent 
with their own affairs as not to notice us, although we stooped behind a small log which did not 
screen half of our bodies. With a few bounds the panther was at the bear's heels, who turned aroimd 
reared upon his hind legs, and commenced the fight in a true pugilistic style with his fore-legs. None 
but those who have witnessed a similar fight, could form an idea of the tremendous and destri'ctive 
weapons which a panther possesses in his hind claws. The panther flew upon him and struck his 
long sharp claws in his eyes, and in less time than it requires to write it, he tore out the bear's 
entrails, with his hind claws — the bear fell upon the earth incapable of resistance. The panther 
walked off a few steps, and turning around, gazed for some time upon his prostrate enemy, who was 
striving ineffectually to replace his entrails with his paws. After viewing him some time, the pan- 
ther sat down, and began to lick down his ruffled hairs, but observing the bear- making efforts to get 
up, he flew upon the helpless fellow again, and a dreadful roaring ensued. 

" I cannot stand by and see the strong oppress the weak," said Girty, whose compassion returned 
as hisr curiosity was gratified. We both cocked our guns, but could not shoot with any degree of 
certainty till the panther would be still, which soon happened. The bear lay on the ground apparently 
dead, and the panther stood sentinel ready for another spring, if he should stir. His breast was pre- 
sented full in view, but he was about forty yards from us, which is a long shot to hit the heart, but 
we could not stir without being seen, and I aimed and fired. He sprang high into the air, and fell 
upon his side. We cautiously advanced to him, (I had not forgotten the former panther's teeth,) 
and one glance at his fiery eye-balls, convinced us that our precaution was well taken. The ball had 
passed through the fore shoulder, and broke both of the bones, but his destructive hind feet were still 
sound. After standing some distance from him, and looking at his ineffectual attempts to reach us, 
till we grew tired, Girty shot him through the head. While Girty was attending to this busines I 
dispatched the still breathing bear with my tomahawk. It was rapidly getting dark, and I built a 
large fire, while Girty skinned the bear. The wolves gathered around, and smelling the flesh, kept 
up a constant howl, which reverberated in the silent woods, and appeared as if the wilderness was 
alive with them ; some were so bold that they ventured almost upon us, but after we shot two, they 
retired beyond the Hght of the fire. We drew down a large sapling, and swung up our bear, and then 
dragged the panther close to the fire, Girty skinning him while I cooked supper, by screwing a ram- 
rod through the flesh of the bear, and holding it in the fire till done.

" That was no wolf s cry," said Girty, and he stood up, and listened attentively, " Then it was 
an owl's," said I, and proceeded to screw another piece of flesh on my ramrod, but Girty stood still, 
and finally the sound came again, apparently much nearer, and could not be mistaken from the hu- 
anan voice with that broken yell, occasioned by rapidly slapping the hand on the mouth as the sound 
issued forth. This peculiar cry we had both heaid, when it could not be otherwise than indelibly 
impressed upon our memories. We knew it to be the cry of Indians, who, we knew from their 
customs, saw the light of our fire at a distance, the night being very dark — and were, as is customary 
with them, hallooing previous to entering the camp, not doubting but we were a part of their own 
party. Girty immediately answered the cry, and we then took our stand at a convenient shooting 
distance from the fire, and awaited their arrival intending to vanquish them if possible. Girty gave 
the directions, " If they number more than four or five, don't shoot, but silently decamp, but if they 
do not, shoot, but aim true, and we are certain of success — remember the rest will be so intimidated 
they will not fight enough to overcome a woman." 

With these directions, we silently awaited the Indians, whom we soon heard advancing with all 
the hilarity of hungry men just entering into camp, where they expected to have a hearty meal. 
The party consisted of twelve, who were all armed with rifles, etc. I kept my place undecided what 
to do. One fellow of a gigantic stature, who appeared as if he could rival a Hercules, and by whom 
the rest appeared as children, walked up to the panther, and catching him by the neck, grunted a 
deep guttural " ough," and held the huge animal up before him, as if it had been a kitten, while some 
of the other warriors crowded around, and expressed their several feelings by the one word " ough,"' 
while others gazed around laughing, probably thinking their companions were playing them a trick 
by hiding from them. During this time I was devising a plan to get out of this dilemma, and ha«3 
finally come to the conclusion to leave as rapidly as I could, and trust to the darkness of the night 
for escape, when a stunning crack from Girty's rifle made me start, and the Indian whose great size 
had so much attracted my attention, with a shrill yell dropped the panther, and fell forwards in the 
fire, by his violent exertions in striving to extricate himself from which, he scattered the burning 
wood about, and completely extinguished the blaze. This was fortunate for us, as it was now so dark 
they could not see which course we took. Girty, as soon as he shot, passed me, and whispering 
" follow me, and load as you run," (for my gun had not been loaded since I shot the panther,) con- 
tinued his course through the thick brush, and I followed as rapidly as I could, although the limbs 
tore the skin from my face and hands at every step. The Indians soon recovered from the dismay 
that this shot had for a time thrown them into, and their yells could now be heard, as they scattered 
in pursuit of us, but the greater number followed directly in our trail, which surprised us, as the 
night was so dark that objects could not be seen one foot before us, as our scratched faces could 
testify. We continued running as fast as the bushes would permit, still the voices of the Indians 
continued on our trail. At length we eame to some running water which we waded into, and con- 
tinued up the stream for some distance in order to escape the bushes which grew luxuriantly on the 
bank, and regaining a level part of land, (which is now a beautiful farm,) we again proceeded rapidly. 
As soon as the Indians reached the brook which we waded into, they were at a stand, and apparent- 
ly at the very spot where we waded into the water. This gave us strong reasons to believe that we 
were trailed by means of a dog, which we had baffled by taking the running water, and we resolved 
to employ that stratagem as often as necessary. Instead of taking advantage of this delay of the 
Indians, we sat on a log to rest, and talked over this day's adventure. The Indians voices had died 
away, and, as we thought, they had returned again to the camp. Whilst we were laughing at their 
movements, which were very dilatory considering they had a dog, the very dog we were speaking of 
came splashing through the brook at our side, and his deep bay for the first time burst upon our 
ears, and again the Indians' voices started us upon our feet, not more than fifty yards from us. We 
both sprang for the race, and again ran up the brook, followed closely by the dog, which was a fellow 
of the large mastiff breed. We kept close together, and proved ourselves the fastest runners in the 
dark, for we soon left the dog some distance behind ; we again waded up the brook some hundred 
yards and then ventured on the land. Here we stopped to rest, and Girty declared he would go no 
farther till he killed the dog, which he said would insure our ruin as soon as daylight appeared. 
« The daylight will enable us to shoot the dog," said I, as I urged him to proceed, but he refused 
peremptorily, alleging that he wanted to kill the dog "just for the fun of cutting his throat !" This 
I thought poor fun, but determined to wait and assist my companion. The dog never barked till he 
saw us, but we were aware of his proximity by his loud and hurried breathing. As soon as he came 
to the brook, by the side of which we sat, Girty drew his knife, and stood to interrupt his passage up 
the bank. The dog hurried up it, and with eyes which glittered like burning coals, sprang at Girty's 
throat, and missing his aim, caught him by the coat collar. The violence with which he struck 
against Girty, combined with his weight, knocked him upon hia knees, but the struggle lasted but a 
moment, Girty caught the dog in his gripe, which was not unlike the force of a vice, and with a few 
thrusts of his knife, threw him upon the ground dead. The Indians had heard the voice of their dog, 
and again cried out in their peculiar manner, which was probably intended to stimulate him to greater 
exertions. We did not tarry long where we were, but again commenced our journey, at a rapid rate, 
teut it being so dark we were entirely ignorant of the direction we were taking. After running about 



THE MIAMI VALLEY. 89 

two hours, we came to the big Miami about two miles above Dayton, which I advised crossing with', 
all expedition, but Girty declared he would not sleep in wet clothes that night, and no argument 
could persuade Inm from his resolution. With perfect composure he lay down to take a nap. After 
listening awhile and hearing no other noise than the wolves, and occasionally the cry of an owl, I 
concluded the Indians had given over the chase, after discovering the death of their dog. I lay down, 
and being weary with the violent exertions I had undergone, soon became utterly unconscious of 
Indians, panthers, hears, and every thing else. 

How long I slept I knew not, but was suddenly awakened by a violent kick in the side, and a cry 
of " awake !" — " no weasel !" in the Indian tongue. I sprang to my feet, upon opening my eyes, 
and observing two Indians standing over me; but my gun was gone, and also my other weapons had 
been taken away. At this moment I heard two lifle cracks in quick succession, a small distance in 
the woods, aird the fellows who surrounded me yelled like devils. My heart sank within me, and I 
became as helpless as a child. The thought of my friend, who had repeatedly risked his life to save 
mine — who had been my constant companion in perils for so many years, and who had accomplish- 
ed more to avenge the murder of my family than I had myself — that friend was now torn from me,, 
and cut off in the full bloom of manhood; my heart sank within me, and despite my exertions to 
prevent it, the tears were forced from my eyes and rolled down my cheeks. The Indians did not 
bind me, but held me by the arms, which was unnecessary, as I should not have attempted to escapCj. 
for my friend Girty was killed. I could have exclaimed with the poet — 

Where thou goest, there will I go. 

Hearing a cry at a greater distance, they led me towards the direction from whence we came. The- 
dim red streaks of light at the east proclaimed the approach of day, and the black clouds brushed off^. 
and by the time we reached the spot where we killed the panther, the sun was gilding the tree tops 
with his rays. It was a beautiful day to those who were not tortured with the anticipation of suffer- 
ing worse than inquisitorial tortures. The big Indian whom Girty had shot, was lying upon his side 
and elbow, with his features distorted into an hundred writhing expressions indicating intense pain- 
from the wound occasioned by Girty's bullet, which had passed entirely through the shoulder, break- 
ing the bone, and mangling the flesh of the arm dreadfully. As soon as he saw me, I thought I could 
discern his eyes glisten with a mixture of joy and pain, as a smile played over his sternly-set features. 
He held out his hand, which I grasped and shook cordially ; this I thought prognosticated no love. 
He motioned me to take a seat, wdiich I obeyed, thinking it best not to arouse this savage's anger by 
refusing what he commanded. " The greatest storms aie preceded by a calm," thought I, as I gazed 
upon the glaring eyes of the Indians who stood about me with their arms folded, aud motionless. I 
looked about me — the panther lay upon the ground where the Indian had dropped him when shot,, 
and the bear still dangled from the sapling; nothing had been disturbed, for the warriors had been 
too busily engaged catching me. By the side of the big warrior sat a diminutive lean man intently 
engaged eyeing some dry bones and muttering some unintelligible words, which I afterwards learn- 
ed were intended as a charm to prevent the wound fiom mortifying, and which — my informant as- 
sured me with an ominous scowl — would be well in six suns (days.) I could not help observing 
with what philosophical patience the wounded man bore the intense pain which his wound must 
have occasioned ; he talked to the warriors around him in the same urbane voice in which he had. 
spoken to me, and gracefully nodded to those who addressed him, which I perceived was invariably 
with some degree of deference. This man was the celebrated chief Michihinaqua or Little Turtle, 
who in aftci times became the greatest chief and warrior of the west, and whose Fabian wisdom 
during a battle was of more avail against General Harrison thair all the chiefs put together. This 
man, at the time of which I speak, although of such a gigantic mould, was but about twenty years 
of age ; his forehead was high, and unusually expansive, indicating to an observer at once the giant 
intellect, which rendered him afterwards so famous. His features were of air uncommonly intellec- 
tual cast, and the expression of his eagle eye can never be erased from my memory — it was an eye, 
the expression of which we do not observe commonly amoirg mankind, but which when we do ob- 
serve it, at once commands deferential respect, for we know that it mirrors a mind of no uncommon 
order. 

Whether the conjurer's skill was of any avail in its curative effects I know not, but the chiers 
wound appeared to grow easy-, and he irow addressed inquiries to those around him, but seldom 
spoke except in monosyllables. Towards iroon the partial paralysis which immediately succeeds a; 
gunshot wound pa.ised off, and the natural vigor and healthiness of his system appeared to influence 
the wound, which already gave symptoms of healing, and he, for the first time, addressed a conver- 
sation to one of his warriors, who suddenly arose, and led me before the chief, who interrogated me 
by means of a warrior, who spoke almost unintelligible English. In an Indian's estimation of cha- 
racter, bravery is the greatest virtue a man can possess, and towards one possessing this quality they 
show respect. This much of the Indian character I was aware of, aud determined to act accordingly- 
, " Who is that other warrior — a brother]" said the chief. 

" He is, and is worthy of it," said I, steraly. 



SH burton's gentleman's magazine. 

-« So lie is," said the chief. " Was it your brother who has killed so many of my warriors lately 1" 
■" It was." 

« And what did you do it for 1" 

^*Sevenge!" said I, speaking through my teeth, for my hot blood had again began to boil, as I 
tSaought of the injury I had sustained, for which the blood of the whole tribe could not atone. 
•" For what injury did you seek revenge 7" said the chief, after some moment's musing. 
■*'■ For the murder of my wife and child, and burning of my property." 
-"' Ah, was it your house which was burnt V 
^' It was." 

^&lt; Then you were in the right for seeking revenge." He then raised up and spoke for some time 
isa athundering voice to his warriors, who stood mute and immoveable. I could not understand all 
tissaid, but part of it I shall never forget. He spoke with energy, and used his arm with a graceful 
ssssvement, which would have shamed many a studied orator of the present day. His speech had its 
lE&amp;cis; he shamed them for wanting to take the life of one whose deeds had made them Jremble. 
^^JSoS" said he," if you would have the blood of one who is as brave as the bravest of you, you can 
lasTO it, but you shall fight him single handed." A young warrior now sprang to his feet, and taking 
mm i»y the shoulder, turned me around, and pointing with his finger towards the south, said " go," 
te which the rest assented by nodding their heads. I possessed a knife of beautiful workmanship, 
■wMch was similar to the modem " bowie knife." This knife which, with my other arms, was now 
^&lt;wen to me, I took by the blade and offered to the chief, as a token of remembrance ; he declined 
SE&amp;5 present. I drew from my vest pocket a small pen-knife, and earnestly pressed it upon him, which 
^® 3rec6ived with reluctance, and then shaking him cordially by the hand, and then the other warriors 
a34emately — many of whom scowled at me with evident hatred, yet shook the proffered hand with a 
■WHtMng grin — I slowly departed. This incident made a greater impression upon me in favor of the 
Indians, than all the logic in Christendom, and very probably had it not been for the incident which 
follows, I should have never again attempted the life of an Indian. 

By the situation of the sun when I left the Indians, it was about three o'clock. I continued my 
&lt;oourse for the Miami river, with the intention of steering straight for Cincinnati, to bear the sorrow- 
M tidings of Girty's death, who I did not doubt, had been killed at the time I was taken prisoner. 
Jt was about one hour after this, as I was plodding my way through the hazel bushes, that I heard a 
■cracking some distance ahead of me. I started at beholding four Indians, one of whom fired at me, 
l)Ut missed his aim. I immediately raised my gun and shot him dead. The others rushed upon me 
"with their tomahawks uplifted, when a shot just behind made me start, thinking others were attack- 
ing me in the rear; but my joy knew no bounds at beholding Tom Girty spring from the bushes, and 
&lt;ciubbing his gun, we rushed upon them, and fought with desperation. Two of the Indians opposed 
•Girty, while one attacked me with a fury which I could not at first resist, but finally his strength 
l)egan to fail beneath such severe exertion, when I drew my bowie knife, and began to use it to some 
jpurpose. The Indian threw his tomahawk, which fortunately struck the blade of my knife, and broke 
tt to pieces ; I watched his motions, and observing that he intended stooping, I threw my hatchet 
low, and nearly severed his wrist. The fellow was mad with passion, and soon gave me an oppor- 
Ktoiity to knock him down, but not till I had received a severe gash in the side from his luiife. I 
aaew had time to see what my companion was about. 

One Indian lay dead near him with his head mangled with the butt of his gun, and the same small 
saaan who had conjured the chief's wound, was yelling most sonorously, and brandishing his toma- 
Isawk at Girty, who was walking around him, watching for an opportunity " lo tie him," as he said. 
Tile Indian appeared unwilling to risk a throw, but kept his eye on Girty, who now seized his gun 
=and clubbing it began to wield it with giant energy. The Indian still brandished his instrument and 
smi rapidly backwards, undecided whether to throw, when he fell over a log flat upon his back. Girty 
leaped upon his breast with both feet, and deprived him for some moments, of breath. We tied his 
Jiands behind with a handkerchief. It is beyond the power of words to express the emotions which 
swelled my breast at this time. All had ended well ! and a fatalist might here find an argument for 
Ms hypothetical doctrine, for the hand of providence appeared to interfere twice, when I expected the 
summons of the grim monster ; still I cared but little whether I lived or not, for I had lost in Thomas 
Crirty all which appeared to me worth living for ; but at this moment — when I beheld death staring 
3XIB in the face — to behold my friend resuscitated as from the dead, and the7i to gain a signal victory 
&lt;over the men (who deserved nothing better for their baseness in disobeying the orders of their chief, 
aad striving to take the life of one whom they had set at liberty) — these rapid transitions from de- 
:sp©xidency to joy, almost made a woman of me, and I caught my friend around the neck and kissed 
Mm — so elated was I at beholding him again. This is no romance, reader, but stern reality ; there 
■■me times when we must weep, and when we must be joyful ; when our minds, like an J^olian harp 
sare grave or acute, as the winds of prosperity or of adversity brush over them, and these are often es 
''variable, and as subject to as sudden mutations, as the external tempests. 

After our mutual joy had somewhat subsided, we deliberated upon the fate of our captive, who sat 
sBspEH a log in a surly mood, and apparently caring little about his approaching fate. I was urgent 
-fe shooting the man whose perfidy had nearly cost me my life, but Girty took the side of humanity, 



THE FRIENDS OF OUR. CHILDHOOD. 91 

and declaied that brave men should not be guilty of murdering a priaoncr in cold blood. At length 
we hung his life " on the cast of a die ;" we agreed to shoot at a target at tlie distance of fifty yards ; 
if Girty won, the prisoner lived and vice versa. We cut a small round target of a bullet patch, and 
cleaned out our guns, to decide the fate of a human being. The Indian now appeared to be aware of 
what we intended doing, and with an earnestness — which was plainly shown, despite his efforts to 
conceal it — he watched our shots. I took the first shot and my ball struclc the outer edge of the tar- 
get — it loas an excellent shot. The Indian's countenance plainly indicated the feelings which work- 
ed within ; he gazed upon the ball hole with a stare in which despair might be plainly depicted ; that 
look could not be exactly described ; few persons could have then looked upon that man and not been 
moved with compassion ; but ray heart had been rendered callous by repeated injuries received of the 
Indians, and the eight of one drove me almost mad ; there was not a pang of compassion in my breast, 
for the agonized feelings which I knew tortured that man ; on the contrary I strived as much as pos- 
sible to procrastinate Girty's time to shoot, merely to prolong the Indian's feeUngs. A painter could 
have delineated eagerness and hope with happy effect, by observing his countenance during the time 
Girty was sighting at the mark; he leaned forward with his hands upon his knees, and with lips 
partly unclosed and strained eyes ; and the veins of his face appeared ready to burst with the intensity 
of his feelings. Girty sighted a long time, which proved he was striving all he could to save the 
poor man's life. The rifle cracked, and the bullet tore out the centre of the target. Girty yelled 
till the echo resounded among the trees, and the Indian sprang upon his feet, while a broad smile 
spread over his face. Girty untied his hands, and he slowly retired, but after going some yards, he 
letumed and extended his hand in gratitude to Girty, who shook it affectionately ; he then extended 
it to me, but I threw it from me with disdain — I was in no humoi for congratulating him upon his 
escape from death. 

"Indian no forget 'em," said the Indian to Girty. 

'• Your false heart contains no gratitude," I thundered out, " and ere to-morrow's sun rises, you and 
your companions will have, perhaps, attempted the life of him who saved yours." He shook hiss 
head and striking his breast with energy, drew his form to its greatest height, as he exclaimed again 
'' no forget 'em." Girty bade him depart, which he did in somewhat faster time than before. 

It is durmg our young days when we are in the vigor of life, and when no " compunctious 
visitings of conscience" trouble us, that we are less subject to the operations of the moral faculties. 
Our minds are then buoyant and elastic, and are incapable of retaining impressions for any length of 
time ; but when we arrive to the " sear and yellow leaf" — when we have passed over the boisterous 
spring and summer when our lives are a continual series of tempests and calms, — and settled into the 
mild and thoughtful autumn, 'tis then we think and not before. Youth is no time to think, and old 
persons err when they expect to see autumn before the stormy spring has passed — if these scenes 
were now to be acted over again I might be prompted to act with moie compassion to my fellow men, 
for I am now an old man. J. M. S.

THE FRIENDS OF OUR CHILDHOOD 



BI THOMAS DUNK E "f (J L I S H , M. D., F H I I. A 



Though the friends of our childhood are with us no moie. 

Yet the thought of their virtues remains in our heart ; 
Enshrined like a holy thing deep in its core, 

Fixed firmly, and of our existence a part. 
And cursed be the man that would chase it away, 

And seek in some other illusion to live ; 
Oh ! where could he sports find, no matter how gay, 

That joy, like the thought of past friendsliip, can give. 

Hence, hence with your mirth, and come banquet with me 

On the memory of ties that are long rent and gone ; 
On the joys, being fled, we no longer may see ; 

On the visions of happiness far away flown. 
Think sadly, yet kindly, on feelings of yore, 

The ties, though now broken, which bound us in youth ; 
When we thought, it is sad we may think so no more, 

The world was a heaven of honor and truth. 



THE SALT LAKE OF I N D E R S K O I 



AND ITS ENVIRONS. 



IN THE KIRGHIS STEPPE, IN ASIA, 



COMPILED FROM THE GERMAN OF DR. TAUSCHEH. 



The following accounts of this remarkable lake, which lies between the 48° and 49° north latitude, 
are extracted from a journey in the south of Russia, performed by Dr. Tauscher, in the years 1807 
to 1811. Hitherto, we were indebted to tlie celebrated naturalist Pallas, for the only accounts we 
had of this salt-lake, which has many peculiar natural productions. He visited it on his first great 
tour through Asiatic Russia, in the years 176.3 to 1769. As no naturalist has since explored that 
interesting country, and the accounts given by Pallas are short and incomplete; and as Dr. Tau- 
scher's journey in these inhospitable tracts was accompanied with circumstances calculated to excite 
general interest, a short sketch of it uill certainly be welcome here. 

The author prefixes to his descri[ition of the Inderlake, and the accoiuit of his tour along the 
banks of it, some general outlines of n picture of the steppes of southern Russia, as he had an op- 
portunity of observing them in the immense tiact extending between the Don, the Wolga, aird the 
Ural, and to the northern coast of the Caspian sea. 

The soutLern steppes bear a very peculiar physiognomy, different from the natural scenery of 
European countries. The eye is lost in immense plains, but seldom broken by an inconsiderable 
eminence, which are without trees or forests, poor in rivers and water, destitute of permanent habi- 
tations, villages or towns and perpetually traversed by nomade tribes, who live in patriarchal sim- 
plicity, and remove from place to phice with their dwellings and flocks, as circumstances require. 
These desolate plains resemble in :i ^reat measure the trackless ocean, which the iravigator must 
cross by the guidance of the compass. 

Early in the spring, and soon after the melliirg of the snow, the surface of the steppe is covered 
with a charming and peculiar vegeiation. Astragalus, tulips, hyacinths, and other fine flowering 
plants, make it appear like a gay garden. But the soft verdant carpet, which at this season adorns 
the meadows of the north and middle of Europe, is entirely unknown in these plains. Only a few 
scattered plants partially cover the ground, and larger or smaller intervals of bare soil aways remain 
visible between them. The scorching heat of the summer months, which in Juire and July often 
rises at noon to 30° and 35° Reaum, almost entirely destroys the children of Flora. All the plants 
wither, and the soil creaks under the foot of the tiaveller. At this season of tire year, the dry grass 
of the desert is frequently on fire, either by chance or design, the flame of which reddens the horizon 
by night, and by day the thick clouds of smoke obscure the sun. These fires, fanned by the wind, 
often spread with incredible rapidity, and only the interposition of a river, or a very broad road, can 
stop the progress of such a torrent of flame, which, especially in the night, affords a splendid and 
awful sight. The heat would be still more intolerable, but for a cooling east wind, which regularly 
prevails from ten or eleven o'clock in the foienoon, to three o'clock in the afternoon, and moderates 
the sultriness of the atmosphere, in the deserts situated on the Wolga and the Ural, between 45° and 
50° north latitude. But if this wind should happen to blow over parts of the desert which are on 
fire, it becomes impregnated with almost intolerable heat, and, like the Arabiair Samoom, relaxes and 
paralyses all the animal powers. Storms are not frequent in these parts, and when they occur, they 
are always inconsiderable. The thunder clouds, which, in other countries, being confined between 
the mountains, produce the severest tempests, have here so wide a range, that they cannot become 
dangerous. At no season of the year does a drop of dew spangle the parched soil of the steppe, and 
lain is very rare. The dry nitrous clay, of which the greatest part of the soil of the steppe consists, 
is rendered by the heat as hard as a rock, and clefts, a yard deep, open in its surface. In those tracts 
which are covered with quicksand, it becomes dreadfully hot, through the action of the sun's rays. 
It is singular enough, that this burning sand, in which it might be supposed that no plant could 
posBibly thrive, is distinguished from the clayey soil, by a more active and luxuriant vegetation. 



THE SALT LAKE OF INDERSKOI. 93 

At the close of autumn, the steppe produces a peculiar Flora of remarkable saline plants, of which 
no country in the world has a greater variety than the paixhed soil of southern Russia. 

The cold in winter, according to accurate observations made in the Moia\ian colony at Sarepta 
on the Wolga, that is, between 48° and 49° north latitude, has been known to be 32° and 33° 
Reaum. Here, as at Moscow and St. Petersburg, quicksilver has been seen to freeze in the open air. 
There are probably few parts of Euiope which experience greater vicissitudes of heat and cold. 

Hills and mountains aie very uncommon in the desert itself. There are, however, in the steppe, 
between the Tlial and the Wolga, some eminences of very considerable height. These are the Mount 
Bogdo, and the rock salt mountains Tschaptschatschi and Arsagar. The first, with the salt lake of 
the same name at its foot, is extremely remarkable, because it incontcstibly rose formerly as a dis- 
tinct island, above the ancient level of the sea. Its base, which is of granite, bears evident traces of 
this fact. Tschaptschatschi and Arsagar, which aie situated more to the south, are not less worthy 
of notice. They consist of large solid masses of the valuable rock salt, which is not inferior to that 
found at Wieliezka in Poland, and at Ilezk in Orenburg ; though, on account of the remote distance, 
and the difficulty of conveyance, hardly any use is made of it. It likewise difiers from the salt last 
mentioned, in forming a mountain of considerable height ; whereas the other is found in strata under 
ground, and must be obtained by the operation of mining. 

As the author's object, the salt lake Inder, was beyond the Ural line, and consequently out of the 
Russian boundaries, on the other side of the river, he chose the nearest post to make preparations 
for undertaking, with safety, an excursion to the Kirghis steppe on the other side. This was the 
fore-post of Inderskoe, seven hundred versts below Orenburg, from which the salt lake is sixty versts 
distant, in a direct line towards the east. Dr. Tauscher arrived there in the beginning of May, 1810, 
having been Uberally furnished with the necessaiy orders and assistance for this expedition, at Oren- 
burg, by the governor-general, prince Wolchonskoi, 

He had only two travelling companions, namely, Mr, Hermann, a clergyman from Kasan, a young 
man full of zeal for the study of natural history, who was of great assistance, especially in his botani- 
cal researches ; and a servant, Jacob Judizky, who was a skilful huntsman, and in the sequel pro- 
cured for his master many rare and beautiful birds. 

The fore-post of Inderskoe, or Gorskoe Kre-post, is situated immediately on the bank of the river 
Ural, and is one of the most inconsiderable places of the lower Ural line. It consists of only forty 
or fifty dwellings, inhabited by about as many Cossack families, commanded by an ofhcer of inferior 
rank, without any fortification, and merely surrounded with narrow ditches and a wicker fence. 

The environs consist of a barren, dry clay desert, on the soil of which there are neither stones nor 
trees. It is only in the low grounds near the river, which are covered during the inundation, that 
willows and poplars are met with, and also some peculiar species of trees which thrive in this climate. 
Neither hay nor corn are giown in this arid country. Some spots, here and there, are cultivated as 
gardens. They have melons, water-melons, and other vegetable productions, especially in such places 
as are covered by the water during the periodical inundation of the river. The mud which it leaves 
behind, like the Nile, produces in the sequel a rapid and luxuriant vegetation, 

A violent attack of fever, of which the author had already felt some symptoms, as he passed 
through Orenburg, increased so much as to render it impossible for him immediately to visit the lake 
on the other side, which was sixty versts distant. A favorable opportunity, however, occurred to send 
his companion Hermann. 

The inhabitants of the neighboring posts receive permission several times in the year to get salt 
for their use from the lake. They always go in great numbers, well armed, and with every military 
precaution, to avoid the hostile attacks of the plundering Kirghis, who attempt on these occasions to 
seize and carry off people and horses. On the second day after the arrival of our travellers, such a 
caravan set out to procure salt, and Hermann was able to go to the lake with perfect safety under 
their protection. He returned from the opposite shore on the third day, quite enraptured with the 
wonderful place he had seen, and the curiosities of the dominion of Floia which he had found. 

The fever, however, which regularly returned every other day, enfeebled Dr, Tauscher so much, 
that he was scarcely able to leave the room, or even his bed, on the intermediate days, Hermann, 
however, daily made longer or shorter excursions in the neighboring country. It unfortunately 
happened, that, among the medicines which they had the precaution to bring with them from Mos- 
cow, there was no Peiuvian bark ; and there being neither medicine nor physician at Inderskoe, he 
was obliged to send for some Peruvian bark to Uralsk, two hundred miles distant, where there was 
a regimental surgeon, and a laboratory belonging to the governnrent. His health gradually improved 
after he had taken this medicine, and, on the 20th of May, he found himself sufiSciently recovered to 
venture upon the expedition to the opposite bank. 

As a protection from the predatory Kirghis, prince Wolchonskoi had ordered an escort of two 
hundred men and one cannon. These people were collected from several neighboring posts of the 
hne, and had already been some days at Inderskoe, 

The author's plan was to spend three days at the least on the banks of the lake, and, if possible, 
to go quite round it ; in order to form a complete idea of its extent and nature, its remarkable envi- 
rons and productions. 



94 burton's gentle 31 a n's magazine. 

A large tent for hinipelf, a new and clean kibitke, belonging to the officer who accompanied him, 
a light carriage to convey the paper necessary to preserve the plants and other requisites, and, in case 
of need, himself and his companions, were the principal articles which he took with him. 

The 22nd of Maj' was fixed for the long desired accomplishment of this plan. The preparations 
for crossing the river, which were directed by the commandant of Inderskoe, could not be carried on 
so rapidly as the impatience of the travellers desired. The river is half as broad again as the Elbe 
at Dresden, deep, but not rapid. There was only one pretty large boat to convey the carriages and 
other effects, successively, to the opposite bank. The Cossacks swam over the river, with their 
horses. This operation seems not to be without danger, and proves the courage of this intrepid race, 
who are very familiar with this element. The Cossack, who intends to cross a river, drives his horse 
into it, plunges in after him, and swims through the stream with him, with the aid of his left arm, 
holding the bridle with his right hand, which he lays on the horse's back. Only the heads of the 
man and the horse remain above the water. It was a singular circumstance to see a carriage, with 
the horses to it, swim over the river. A Cossack, placed like Neptune, in the front of the carriage, 
guided the frail vehicle through the stream, flourishing a knute instead of the trident. 

Their passage was completed in a few hours, and every thing safely landed on the left bank. The 
author now amused himself in examining his company. The whole had a motley appearance. It 
was a medley of several nations, which, besides the proper Ural Cossacks, consisted of Calmucks, 
Tartars, Khghis, etc.; rude sun-burnt countenances, more noble Tartar manly features, and flat Mon- 
gol effeminate countenances, with beardless chins, small sunken eyes, and high cheek-bones ; some 
covered with cloaks made of sheeps' skin, with the rough side outwards ; some in tanned horse-hides, 
some in short fur cloaks with hoods, and a few in a light dress and a shirt ; the head covered with a 
large fox-skin cap, or with a conical felt hat, or without any covering. 

Their arms were no less diffeient than their costume. The smallest number had fire-arms, some 
only a single pistol, most of them pikes, others bows and arrows ; and several only a sabre, and 
others again none. Such was the appearance of the soldiers of the Ural, who came to protect our 
travellers fiom their hereditary and frontier enemies, the Asiatic Kirghis, on whose territory they ia 
fact were, 

A troop of Kirghis, in eight or ten tents, whom they found on the other side of the river, though 
they were said to be of the Russian party, were ordered to take down their dwellings and depart with 
then herds farther into the steppe, because the officer, who accompanied the author, judged it un- 
advisable to have these equivocal friends in the rear. 

The company now proceeded in an easterly direction : but this was done without much regularity. 
The escort dispersed, and each took his own way. Even the cannon was at one time so far off, that 
the author lost sight of it, and it might easily have been taken by the Kirghis, who were said to be 
so formidable. 

Dr. Tauschcr thought of remedying this confusion as well as he could; ordered the cannon to be 
near his carriage, and, after a march of five or six hours, reached the first watering place, a small 
lake of good water, where they halted. 

In a few hours they set out again, because the author wished to reach in the same day the vicinity 
of the lake, which was still twenty miles distant. 

The ground from this place rose to a gentle eminence, and became of a different quality. Whereas 
it was before sandy, not wholly destitute of water, and covered with a pretty luxuriant vegetation ; 
it was now dry and clayey. Here and there gypsum-like stones stood out, and the vegetation was 
less fresh. Several of the plants which Hermann had found on his first visit to the lake, were met 
with here, such as the beautiful Orohanche, with light blue flowers. Allium Caspium Pall., Allium 
inderiense, n. sp. and a small Tetradynatnist, with the boat-shaped seed vessels allied to the genus 
Bunias, which plant was afterwards designated as a new genus, and called by the author's name. 

Towards evening they reached their journey's end, namely, some ditches, about a verst from the 
lake, with brackish, but yet drinkable water. Here the travellers pitched their camp, planted the 
cannon, and placed posts on the surrounding eminences to prevent surprise. The visit to the lake 
was deferred to the following da)''. 

From the place where the company were encamped, the banks of the lake gradually shelved off 
towards the east, and the white salt surface of the lake shone from this side like new fallen snow. 
The lake is of the form of a long ellipse, and its circumference may be about twenty miles. It is sur- 
rounded on three sides by a row of hills, the interior of which, towards the lake, is exposed by the 
fall of the earth, and consists of strata of clay of different colors. The water of the lake, which in no 
season of the year, and in no place, exceeds a yard in depth, was now almost entirely evaporated. 
The whole superficies of the lake consisted of one mass of the most beautiful and pure crystals of sea 
salt, rivalling the snow in whiteness, without a perceptible mixture of glauber salt, and, at some depth, 
gradually passed into a mass not unlike rock salt. 

In some places, springs from the bottom of the lake had worked their way through the solid mass 
to the surface, forming perpendicular openings of considerable depth, so that the long pikes of the 
Cossacks could not reach the bottom. The quantity of the salt, thus wonderfully prepared by nature, 
is so great, that it might, perhaps, supply all Europe, if the geographical situation of the lake were 



THE SALT LAKE OF INDERSKOI. 95 

favorable to it. As a new layer of salt is produced every year on the surface, like the annual growth 
of trees, there would be no fear that this repositoiy would ever be exhausted. 

It was, indeed, part of the author's plan to make the tour of the whole lake, and thus obtain a 
complete knowledge of its situation, and the peculiar productions of its ■vicinity ; but the commanding 
officer of his escort assured him that this could not be done without exposing themselves to the dan- 
ger of an attack from the Kirghis. He, therefore, contented himself with exploring half the right side 
of the lake with a small escort, sending his companion Hermann to do the same on the left bank, 
which is the most difficult of access. 

Even Pallas says, that he had obtained from the brine a number of insects in good preservation ; 
Dr. Tauscher also enriched his collections from the same source, with many rare and beautiful kinds 
of beetle. Our travellers did not find, in these parts, the rare and dangerous venomous spider of 
southern Russia, which Pallas says he found swimming uninjured in the salt waters. It is remark- 
able that he found in the brine, in very great numbers, several species of insects, which he very 
seldom found in the steppe itself. This was the case, for instance, with the Calandra picea, Pall., 
which he saw alive, by thousands, in the salt water. Among the few kinds which he caught in the 
desert, the very scarce Myocellata, Pall, gave him much pleasure, though he found only a single 
specimen. 

His collection of plants was richer and more important. The saline plants were not advanced 
enough for him to make any remark upon them. The origin of the lake may be explained in a 
plausible manner, from its situation and the nature of its environs. The plateau called the Inder 
Mountain, elevated above the river and the surrounding steppe, is from two to three hundred versts 
in circumference, and is traversed in the middle by the river Ural. The soil, particularly that part of 
the plateau beyond the river, consists of rock salt, which is covered with a stone resembling alabaster. 

The lake owes its origin to subterraneous springs, which penetrated through the solid mass of rock 
salt, and found a vent in the funnel-shaped hollow of the rock. The water proceeding from the melt- 
ing of the snow in spring, which collects in the deeper part of the lake, perhaps also contributes. 

Here, too, the pretty general law of nature is confirmed, according to which alabaster or gypsum 
is usually found near masses of salt. This, as here, is the case at Ilesk, near Orenburg ; in the rock 
salt mountains of Arsagar and Tschaptschatschi ; in the Volga and Ural steppe ; and in the rock salt 
works at Wieliezka in Poland. As we have already stated, it was Dr. Tauscher's intention to spend 
three days in examining the lake and its environs : circumstances induced him to shorten this period. 
The commanding officer reported to him that he had been informed by Kirghis spies, who were of 
the party of the Russians, that a troop of four hundred Kirghis had assembled a feiv leagues distant, 
and threatened the company with an attack. In the second night, the fore posts stationed round the 
camp were, in fact, disturbed by a party of Kirghis, who, however, departed when they found them 
resolute. 

He was by no means disposed to engage, without need, in contests with these marauders: besides, 
he had entirely attained the object he had proposed ; he therefore judged it best to return to the op- 
posite bank, and, early on the morning of the third day, surrounded by his escort, carried his resolu- 
tion into effect. As they approached the watering place, half way on the road, where they halted 
when they came, the author saw a number of people, of strange appearance, encamped near it. They 
were surprised at this, because, at their previous visit, they had not seen a human being. On in- 
quiry. Dr. Tauscher learnt that a Kiighis sultan, or nobleman, was about to occupy with his troops 
the inclosed market-place at Orenburg. The sultan, on his side, had inquired of our author's escort, 
who he was; and, on being informed, amicably offered him his hand, and invited him, in the Tartar 
language, which his companion interpreted, to pass the night in his tent. Notwithstanding our 
author's great desire to accept this proposal, he judged it best to return, without delay, to the fort on 
the other bank, in order to dry the plants which he had collected. 

He continued his route to the opposite bank, but was followed by the court chaplain of the Kirghis 
sultan, who offered to remain as a hostage in the fort, till Dr. Tauscher should have arrived on the 
other side of the river. For the reasons above mentioned, the Doctor sent him also back ; and leamt, 
in the sequel, how fortunate it was that he did so. In the same night that the Kirghis chief hospitably 
offered him his tent, he was attacked by an hostile tribe of his own nation, and robbed of all his herds 
of horses, camels, and sheep. Thus, the author, in all probability, escaped the misfortune of being 
carried as a slave into the interior of Asia, to Chiva or Bucharia. 



SWEEPINGS FROM A DRAWER. 



1. A prudent man will avoid whatever gives occasion for remark ; for whatever is talked of 
much, will be talked of unfavorably. 

2. The most generous man, in making a gift, never parts entirely with the sense of property*; 
and will be offended if, in his presence, you use the gift entirely as your own. 

3. Matters external to us, and resting in opinion, cause more vanity than those which are with- 
in us and cerftiin. Probably more pride is felt in knowing, than in being, the duke of Wellington. 

4. How many persons mistake talking about literature for literai-y talk ! 

5. Nothing is more common than for persons to suppose that they know all about an obscure 
transaction, because they know something not known to others. We know what we know, but we 
don't know what we don't know. 

6. The conclusions of morality are as certainly reached through the avenues of vice, as through 
the paths of virtue. 

7. There is often as much difference between works and their author, as between the sweet- 
ness of honey and the sting of the bee. 

8. Southey's descriptions are ivroiighf; Scott's are cast. 

9. The mind is a disease of the body. Spirit is a disease of matter. 

10. The highest wisdom of the mind is to acquiesce in doubt — to admit that the reason of a 
thing cannot be given — that a fact or its cause cannot be known. 

11. Most people's God is the reflection of their own spirit against the skies; and the comfort of 
cultivating God is the complacency of viewing that self-image. 

12. W is a Scot, exact and close — so honest that he is almost a rogue. 

13. The issues of happiness and misery, of success and failure, both in this life and that which 
is to come, seem rather to depend on the strength and weakness of the mind and temper, than on 
purity of heart and rightness of intention. There was a truer philosophy in the Roman Greek view 
which made valor virtue,* than n ouis, which makes it consist in goodness. He who surveys the 
course of life and the history of man in all their breadth and fulness, will be tempted to name pru- 
dence piety and power morality. 

14. It is dangerous to inquire too closely after what is concealed. He that gropes in a dark 
room may chance to put his fingers into something nasty. 

15. There are many men who will permit you to use them even to the baseness of contempt, 
who yet will not suffer you to take a liberty with them. Because a horse will let you ride him, it 
does not follow that you may tickle his heels. 

16. No man, whatever maj^ be his persoiial gain, ever grew solidly rich, who was not personally 
frugal. 

17. What is called impudence is generally either ignorance or forgetfulness. 

18. If you hear a man sincerely expressing an intense admiration of virtue, or a soul-felt appre- 
ciation of its excellence, you may be quite sure that he has not got it. 

19. There are few cases in which a gift does not cost more than a purchase. 

20. Men will generally dislike you more for placing yourself upon an equality and familiarity 
with them, when your place is above them and distant from them, than your superiors will dislike 
you for encroaching upon them, because defeat in personal rivalry is more galling than in rivalry of 
place. 

21. A bad man may possess the world ; a good man doth possess the universe. 

22. Modesty sometimes takes the air of presumption ; self-conceit more often assumes the appear- 
ance of diffidence. 

23. The passions are but various forms of mental insanity. 

24. The vices and defects of others constitute the mirror in which we should see our own fail- 
ings.

POaTLANB. THE WHITE HILI.S IX THE DISTANCE. PHENOMElSrA. PREPAHATIONS FOR A JOUR- 
NET. THE JOURJfET BEGUN. THE FIRST DAx's PHOeRESS. 

You may stand on the shores of Casco Bay, and see, in the sunshine of any clear day, the glit. 
taring peaks of the White Hills, with Mount Washington shooting up above all the rest, like a 
white-haired patriarch among his children, themselves hoar with age. But, as the bard of Melrose 
Abbey has so beautifully said. 

If you would view this scene aright, 
Go visit it by the pale moonlight ; 

for, even at the distance just named, when the night is clear and unclouded, and the sharp north- 
west wind has driven off even the faintest curl of vapor which sunset had illumined, you may see 
the sheen of their broken outline, (showing like the beginnings of those arrowy streaks of the au- 
rora borealis, which at times shoot up in the north so brilliantly,) as they glitter beneath the rays 
of the clear, cold moon. Such a picture, constantly before their eyes, the people of that beautiful 
little city, which lies upon the shores of the island-studded Casco, have come to look upon as one 
of the chief charms with which nature has invested their landscape ; and they show it to travellers 
as one of the memorabilia of the tour that takes in their city as a temporary resting-place. 

It was at this spot that a party of some ten or twelve of us were watching anxiously, one mid- 
summer afternoon, for the dull and heavy mass of leaden clouds which had for three days hung 
over us, dispensing plentiful showers of rain, to pass away, and release us from the tedious quaran- 
tine we were enduring, on our way to visit the White Hills of New Hampshire. At about noon, 
it had ceased to rain, and, soon after, we thought we could discern a faintly defined streak of light 
in the extreme point of the western horizon. Watching as we were, with intense anxiety, for the 
first symptom of relief from the horrible weather which so long had bound us, judge of the extent 
of our joy as we saw that line of light extending itself from west to north, and then the whole of 
the ebon mass of cloud which hung over us, lifting gradually up from the entire sweep of that ho- 
lizon ; and, as its lower edge neared the zenith, momentarily increasing the rapidity of its retreat, 
leaving a clear, azure field below, until, at length, the sun, descending to his daily rest, was left un- 
obscured, and the full gush of his rays fell, like a sudden shower of flaming gold, upon all the hills 
and valleys ! Wheeling slowly down the path of his orbit, he reached his setting, unobscured by a 
single wreath of cloud or vapor, and sank belov/ the distant snowy peaks that made oirr horizon, 
with not a ray lost to our gazing eyes. When the sky had first begun to clear, these white moun- 
tain spires had been the earliest objects in the wide extending landscape to develope themselves ; 
and never seemed they clearer or more conspicuous than then, as they stood out in almost sudden

and unusually bold relief, upon the western sky, with the full flood of sunlight pouring over them, 
while to us the sun was still obscured ; and, no sooner had the last level beam of the glorious orb 
shot along the loftiest of their summits, then, as if by magic, most beautiful formations of ambei 
clouds, their edges touched all along with intensely shining gold, appeared directly above the path 
he had been treading, and continued there, assuming divers grotesque shapes, and seeming to sport 
in fantastic gyrations amidst the sunlight from below, until, as twilight deepened, they all passed 
gradually away before the gentle breeze, which seemed to be sweeping oflf with its zephyrs all im- 
purity from the sky, making it beautiful for the moon and stars. Meanwhile, the bosom of the bay, 
which had received beneath it the heavy deposit of all that mighty avalanche of clouds which we 
had watched so long in its caieer, was sending back the rays of the silver queen of night, who was 
at the full, and to that quarter of the heavens did we next turn our straining gaze. Slowly ascend- 
ing to the zenith 

That orbed maiden, wjth white fire laden, 
Whom mortals call the moon, 

soon began to let fall her riys upon the yet palpably discerned panorama of distant hills — for they 
look loveliest in the clear twilight — and we retired from the scene, upon which we had for so many 
hours been gazing, leaving their snowy coronals yet visible as they were towering aloft in the still 
and solemn midnight. It was a scene never to be forgotten by one of that group, and, as may be 
fairly inferred, was looked upon as a fitting commencement of our purposed visit to the White Hills 
of the north — and so indeed it was ; for every step we took, afterwards, upon that tour, pioved 
equally memorable. 

Early on the next morning, (all our aiTangcments having been complete for two whole days,) the 
vehicles drove up to the door of our excellent landlady's hospitable mansion, and the process of 
packing ourselves and our luggage commenced. Men, women, and even children, (laigish ones — 
no sensible folk go on parties of pleasure with babies,) rods, creels, guns, and baskets — trunks, port- 
manteaus, carpet bags, and hat cases — overcoats, cloaks, upper-benjamins, and umbrellas — all were 
made away with at last, and off we sat, rather a la Gilpin — 

Ten precious souls, and all agog, 
To dash through thick and thin ! 

Leaving Portland, we passed through many pretty manufacturing and farming villages in Maine 
and New Hampshire, and stopped for the night at Conway, which is most picturesquely situated, 
being surrounded by hills, and its neighborhood abounding with woodland and river prospects, most 
delightfully attractive to such of our number as had the happiness of being skilled vvith the pencil, 
the pen, the gun, or the angle. But we were all obliged to yield some portion of our individual 
preferences, at this stage of our journey, on account of the impossibility of getting accommodations 
for the whole of us, either in the way of comfortable quarters for so many, or in that of the requi- 
site conveyances. So we contented ourselves with one night's experience of our good landlord's 
hospitality, enjoyed a fine sunrise view of the pleasant village of Coixway, and pushed on. 



CHAPTER II. 

AERITAL AT BARTLETT, ASD MISTRESS HALl's. MOUNTAI^f FARE. CLOUBIAND PHENOMENA, 
AGAIX. A COUNCIL CALLED. A NIGHT AMONG THE HILLS. 

We reached Bartlett after a very interesting ride of nine hours, with a full view of the whole 
White Mountain range almost constantly before us, at about two o'clok in the afternoon, and found 
ourselves quite harmonious upon one point, at least — and that was, the necessity of immediate pre- 
parations for dinner. We could not have chosen our quarters better, with this view, had we had it 
in our power to make a selection from among a thousand ; and this was all the more fortuiaate, as 
oui good hostess, Mistress Hall's, was the only " place of entertainment for man and beast" that 
sensible men and epicurean beasts would think of staying at on the whole road, from mine host 
Abbot's, at Conway, to the Crawford Cabin in the Notch. What a dinner the good lady provided 
foius ! Had I the pen of a Scott, I would essay to give the reader some notion of its details ; for 
Jhave observed that there was no topic upon which Sir Walter was wont to dwell in more loving 
detail, and with more overflowing unction, than this ; but I pretend to no such advancement in 
trencher lore as the genial poet of Abbotsford could fairly boast, and so admirably display. Suffice 
it, that we ate a most hearty and traveller-like dinner, without thinking of the lack of silver forks, 
damask napkins, finger bowls, or hot water plates. If there was no Poulet a la financiere, there 
were tender pullets, much more to our fancy ; if there was no Macaroni a I'ltalienne, there was

the very best of home-made cider-apple sauce, which was equally acceptable to our hungry palates; 
if no Cofektles de veau santces aux fines herhes were upon our table cTJioie, we were content with 
our cutlets upon one plate, and our herbs upon another. The sauce of a good appetite we found a 
very good substitute for all the sauce fiamarde, or sauce vin Madtre,- and as to our tomatos, we en- 
joyed them all the same as, at Astor House or the Tremont, we should have done, had we seen 
them labelled sauce tomate. 

While we were taking the mid-way glass of a bottle of claret, which one of our number had 
taken the precaution to stowaway with a respectable number of individuals of the same and kindred 
families among our luggage, previous to departing from Portland, one of the ladies, who for some 
minutes had been admiring the mountainous prospect out of the western window, exclaimed " What 
a magnificent sight !" Approaching the window, we saw a mass of heavy clouds rolling and tum- 
bling about the peaks of the most distant hills, whence vivid flashes of lightning were darting spi- 
rally down into the deepest recesses of the valleys that lay between the mountains. We all rushed 
into the open air, for the sight was awfully grand, and was momentarily growing more and more so, 
as the clouds, having tumbled from peak to peak, and having dived lower and lower along the hill- 
sides, were rapidly nearing the sunny intervale, in which our hostelry was so pleasantly situated. 
At length, it burst upon us with all its fury, and soon drove us in doors, whither hastening precipi- 
tately, we called a council of our sagest men and matrons, with Mistress Hall to the fore, at which 
the questions, " Is this storm liliely to last long 1" and " Were it not better to make up our minds 
to stay here to-night 1" were discussed with much world and weather wisdom, and ability. Being 
lovers of comfort, haters of wet travelling, fond of good quarters, and contented with those we had 
fallen into, the preliminary question being unanimously decided in the affirmative, we came to the 
conclusion, nemine contrudicentc, that there, at Bartlett, in the comfortable inn of Mistress Hall, 
would we cubiculate upon that (now not remembered) night of July, one thousand eight hundred 
and thirty odd. 

Like Jupiter's on Olympus, our divan had been held over our nectar and ambrosia, and in the 
midst of thunder. The council being over, the former were removed, and the latter ceased its louder 
peals, and was heard during the remainder of the evening in distant mutterings only, as an occa- 
sional suppressed growl would spend an agreeable hour or two in redoubling its echoes among the 
thousand rocky hill-tops that loomed gloomily amid the faint flashes of the lightning. Our next 
thought was of that post-prandian repast, which we w ere just the party to enjoy most richly — tea f 
The storm had rarified the air extremely, and a brisk fire was at once the suggestion of all our feel- 
ings and the work of a moment. So we pulled down the paper hanging curtains, drew our cloth- 
covered chairs (home-made and soft) around the blazing hearth, and awaited the coming of " the 
tea things.*^' They came at last, and a meny meal had we. After which, a round game of cards, 
the whole ten of us playing — with peas representing fourpennies, to be faithfully redeemed in coin 
at the end of our sport, for our wagers. I remember winning one pea for my share of the plunder, 
and I remember, too, the rosy cheeked boy the next morning got what it was exchanged for, as he 
told me how far it was to Tom Crawford's. 

Our arrangements for the night were curious to behold. Commodious as was our inn, it had ne- 
ver contained ten sleepers, in addition to its regular tenants, before, and the most ingenious shifts 
and devices were resorted to, to bestow ourselves with some degree of comfort. The beds were all 
filled first, certain obvious considerations settling that point of precedence, of course ; and it devolv- 
ed upon the baccalaureate portion of the party to exercise their ingenuity in the fabrication of a tem- 
porary resting place. The point was settled by a skilful distribution, and workmanlike collection of 
chairs, upon which we were fourrd sleeping as quietly, when the early house bell rang in the morn- 
ng, as if we had been reposing upon the downiest feathers, or the most iricely matted mattress. 



TO THE RIVER 



Fair river ! in thy bright clear flow 

Of labyrinth-like water. 
Thou art an emblem of the glow 

Of beauty — the unhidden heart — 
Tire playful maziness of art 
In old Alberto's daughter. 
But when within thy wave she looks, 
(Which glistens then and trembles,) 



Why then the prettiest of hrooks 
Her worshipper resembles. 

For in my heart — as in thy stream— 
Her image deeply lies — 

The heart which trembles at the bean^ 
The scrutiny of her eyes. 



RESUSCITATED JOE 



PHILADELPHIA^ 



Mankind are often ti-onbled with a vice 
Which leads to error, aud is called Prejudice. 



OifCE on a time, the manager 

Of a laige theatre in a neighboring town, 

Which had run down, 

Whilst trusting solely to the histrionic art ; 

By way of giving it a start, 

Thought best, if possible, to make a stir ; 

And much to every body's satisfaction, 

Bills were stuck up on all the walls, 

And laige red staring capitals 

Gave notice of a wonderful attraction, 

A sort of spectacle, which ne'er had been. 

Which never was and never should be seen. 

The news flew fast on every tongue. 
Night came, and to the theatre all throng. 

No vacant places ; 
Many had not the least accommodation : 
It was a general sea of human faces. 

Hushed into expectation. 
Forth came the hero of the night and bowed ; 
The audience cheered him with applauses loud. 

A man divine — 
Endowed by nature wirh such musical feeling. 
That, grunting — squealing. 
He could at will. 
As if he'd always lived on swill, 

Exactly imitate a swine. 
Sometimes he grunted with a deep bass note ; 
Then on the treble key. 
Would rise majestically. 
Just like a porker, when they cut his throat. 
The thing 
Was almost universally 
Allowed to be 

The most astonishing. 

An envious fellow, sitting in the pit. 
Felt quite indignant at this admiration ; 

He could not relish it, 

A bit. 
To see this wretched gulling of the nation. 

In truth to make such a confounded fuss 
About a porcellian imitator, 
Was a disgrace to human nature, 

And quite ridiculous. 

Soon as the noise had ceased, our man 
Rose from his seat, and thus began : 
" Ladies and gentlemen, 

I hereby public notice give, 

That if I Uve, 
To-morrow, at this self same hour, 



If with your presence you will honor me, 
You then shall see, 
In this enchanting line 
Of acting, all conceive so fine, 
A much more splendid exhibition of my power." 

Pat to the minute, 
The theatre was filled with the whole population; 
And thick as they could cram, 
A perfect jam — 
It seemed, indeed, as if near all creation 
Had crowded in it. 

Both came upon the stage, 
And first began 
The imitating man. 
Who now in fact was all the rage. 
Loud rung the claps, the theatre resounds 
As if their admiration knew no bounds. 

The other's turn next came, 

The one who envied him his hard-earned fame. 

He had a real, genuine, live pig. 

Not very big, 

So as to lie concealed beneath his gown, 

And most effectually to cheat the town, 

He every now and then would pinch the shoat, 

And without more ado, 
Produced as rich and natural a note, 

And quite as high, 
And true. 

As e'er was heard to issue from a stye. 

But 'twas no go; 
The audience hooted him with one consent : 

'Twas voted low. 

And even more. 

They all considered it a bore, 
And a most vulgar and unnatural imitation. 
In fact, they could not tell for what 'twas meant; 
While for the first. 
There was another universal burst 
Of admiration. 

Our friend perceiving 
His chance was very small 

Whilst thus deceiving; 
And giving vent at once to his indignant gall, 
Exclaimed, as loud as he could bawl, 
" A pietty set of critics are ye all, 
To applaud the mimic — hiss the original !" 
And then, to show them how they were mistaken, 
Pulled out his pig and saved his bacon. L.

CRUISE OFF BARBARY. 

The Constitution, having settled the warUke stomach of the emperor of Morocco, now proceeded 
to cruize as the flag ship of the gallant Preble, along the Barbary coast. On the 17th December, 
1803, the Enterprize being in company, she captured a Turkish ketch, called the Mastico, with 
seventy Tripolitans on board, and on the' night of the 26th, having made the coast of Tripoli, she 
stood oif and on for the morninsr. 



THE LEVANTER. 

Who has passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and has not become perfectly familiar with the 
wind that sweeps down the Mediteiranean for days and weeks together, with unmitigated fury 1 A 
wind that acts as a prohibition to every vessel bound up the straits duiing its continuance, and 
whose cold and cheerless whistle I can imagine I hear around me at this moment. 

The Levanter is a perfect tyrant ; day after day, it sweeps down the long narrow sea, and ever 
and anon slants from the rock of Gibraltar with a resistless force, bowing to the water's edge the 
crank merchantmen that obstruct its path, and scattering the xebecs of the Moors to the cliffs and 
nooks of the Mauritanian shore. It is supposed to pioceed from the Black Sea; but whether it does, 
or does not, those who endeavor to beat against it look blank enough in all conscience. 

It was just before the hour of midnight in the Mediterranean, when a tall frigate, under close 
reefed topsails, came swiftly down before the breath of a Levanter. Hei dead-lights were in, her 
ports closed, and as she came bounding along the waves in gloomy silence, she seemed to be look- 
ing out for a harbor. 

" A dirty night, sir," said the first lieutenant to the commodore, as he came from the look-out at 
the forecastle. 

" It is," replied the latter, as he gave a scrutinizing glance at the binnacle compass. 

At this moment, the sails aloft began to shiver and flap against the masts. 

" We are headed off," said the commodore ; " call all hands !" 

" All hands !" piped the boatswain's mate, and soon every man was at his post. 

" About ship," bellowed the commodoie. 

" Station for stays," said the first lieutenant, and away flew the willing crew to execute the orders 
of their oflftcers. Soon the ship answered her helm like a thing of life, and coming on the other 
tack, dashed onward for the space of an hour without any diminution of speed. 

" Are we not near the land V said the officer of the deck to the old master, as he came growling 
out of the cabin, like a bear with a sore head. 

" Very near, sir," said the master ; " it lies under that fog bank to the southward and eastward, 
and should the wind increase any, or haul to the northward, we shall be on the rocks before eight 
bells." 

" That is a great consolation, truly," said the lieutenant, as he turned to look in the direction 
pointed out by the master. 

" Breakers ahead — close aboard !" cried the look-out man from the lee cathead, . 

'• We must wear ship, sir," said the commodore, in a stern voice, as he came out of the cabin. 



102 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" All hands wear ship !" thundered the deck truropet. 
" Put your helm up !" said the commodore. 
" Ay, ay, sir !" answered the old cunner at the wheel. 
" Shiver the after yards !" 
" Brace the head yards square !" 

" Pull cheerily, you lubbers — belay !" were the orders given in quick succession by the commo- 
dore. 

" She comes up to the wind, sir," said the cunner, touching the tip of his tarpauhn, while he 
held it on to his head with his other hand. 

" Brace the after yards, and haul every thing aft !" roared the commodore, as the frigate hung for 
a moment between two mighty waves, and then plunged up the black side of the hill of waters. 

As she wore round, she passed within a short distance of the rocks, over which the heavy billows 
dashed in sheets of quivering foam, while thunder, hoarser than that of the lightning-rent heavens, 
answered in awful murmurs from the rocky caves, and mingled with the shriller notes of the in- 
creasing gale. 

The shore was hid in the dark wings of the storm, and naught was seen but the dreadful break- 
ers, whose spray fell hke a shower of winter rain upon the trembling deck of the gallant ship. It 
was a fearful moment ; a fathom nearer in, and the shrieks of five hundred drowning victims would 
have gone up amid the roar of the gale to the God of nature, while ten thousand fragments of the 
wreck would have strewn that benighted and bloody coast. 

Firm as a rock, stood the gallant Preble and his noble crew, and as the frigate rode by on the top 
of the crested wave, he saw she headed off from the shore. 

" She has cleared them !" said he, in a thrilling voice. " Pipe down, sir !" and immediately left 
the deck. 

Commodores must never show their feelings before their crews ; they must be firm amid the dan- 
gers of the contending elements, as well as amid the iron rain of battle ; but when they have reach- 
ed their cabins, they may return thanks to the God of battles and the king of storms, without inter- 
fering with the rules and regulations of the sea service. Commodore Preble was one of the bravest, 
and, at the same time, strictest officers in the service, and his character is now held up as a model 
to the aspirant for naval glory. 

" Eight bells !" cried the orderly stationed at the cabin door, as he popped his head over the rail- 
ing of the companion-way. 

" Eight bells !" echoed the quarter master at the binnacle, and eight bells were struck by the mes- 
senger boy at the galley. The master looked at the first lieutenant with a grin of satisfaction, and 
soon the two took a pull of half and-half, in honor of the skill of their commander. 

" I say. Jack, ain't you dry V said a jolly tar, to his messmate, as he rolled a quid of old Nip- 
cheese poison, of the size of a young tree toad, from the larboard to the starboard side of his face. 
" My eyes, I are/" said the party addressed ; " I feel as though I had swallowed the cook, galley, 
coals, and all !" 

" Splice the main brace, sir !" said the commodore, to the lieutenant of the watch, as he mounted 
the horse-block, and gave a last look towards the breakers, whose dying thunder and awful hissing 
fell upon his ear. 

The I ufile of a drum was now heard amid the howling of the gale, and soon busy feet were seen 
moving towards the red bull, near the scuttle butt. Tin pots of old Jamaica were now turned bot- 
tom side up, and Jack was ready to take another graze by the breakers ; " though," as one of them 
said, while he hitched up his lee waistband, " if he could have his own way, he would prefer a cou- 
ple of fathoms more of sea room, and not quite so much wind." 

The storm now began to abate, a light stripe extended along the eastern horizon, and when the 
day dawned, the blooming shores of Sicily were seen about ten miles off, bathed in the purple tints 
of an eastern morning. 

The commodore, finding the ship had stretched her rigging by her heavy plunges, and that seve- 
ral spars had been sprung by the force of the gale, put his helm up, and ran for Syracuse. At nine 
o'clock, he came to an anchor beneath the snow- clad summit of Etna, and saluted the Neopolitan 
flag with twenty-one guns. The Levanter was now at an end ; countless merchantmen came up, 
upon the breath of the balmy west wind^ and stretched along the Italian coast, while the flags of 
every nation waved in the breeze, and glittered in the sunbeam. 



BEFORE TRIPOLI. 

On the 26th of July, 1804, commodore Preble, in the Constitution, in company with three brigs, 
three schooners, two bombs, and six gun boats, appeared off Tripoli, and proceeded to make the ne- 
cessary arrangements for bombarding that nest of troublesome pirates. 

The frigate PhiladelpTria, captain William Bainbridge, which run npon the rocks &lt;^ the m«lle of 



OLD IRONSIDES. 103 

the harbor, in the latter part of the previous year, had been destroyed in a most gallant manner by 
Decatur and his intrepid band, whose names, had they lived in the glorious days of Sparta, would 
have been traced upon the poitals of the temple of fame, and whose statues would have been raised 
beside the heroes of Thermopyte, in the brazen temple of Mars. The fame of Morris, whose foot 
first trod the crowded deck of the Philadelphia, and of many others who acquired the title of heroes 
in that war, may well be cherished by evevy true-hearted American ; but alas ! " the days of chivalry 
are over,'' the brave men, now high in rank, who bearded the Turk in his den and set the captive 
free, who beat about the shores of cruelty and bloody despotism, and spilled their own blood like 
water, in the defence of the honor of their native country, are begrudged the miserable pensions at 
last allowed them by the talking Solons of the land. 

Even the old Constitution herself is considered by many of the present day to be unfashionable", 
and the good old arrangements of former days are made to give way to hurricane houses, water sails, 
heavy masts, forecastle guns, raised decks, and spritsail jards ; her white streak runs in a bow, and 
isingglass windows mark hei quarter galleries, through which those only can see whose gimblet- 
eyed vision would penetrate a millstone. 

The destruction of the Philadelphia amid the gloom of night had taught the Tripolitans to fear 
the navy of the young republic. The yell of the drowning Mussulmen — the thunder of the Phila- 
delphia's cannon as they were exploded by the wreathing flames — the crackling of the old hull a^ 
it belched forth its gathered torrents of fire and smoke, and the hell-like explosion as the magazine 
ignited and sent the countless masses of that unfortunate wreck high amid the murky heavens, still 
rang upon then ears, and filled their breasts with terror. 

Tripoli, however, was a city well walled, protected by batteries judiciously constructed, mounting 
one hundred and fifteen pieces of heavy cannon, and defended by twenty-five thousand Arabs and 
Turks. The harbor was protected by nineteen gun-boats, two galleys, two schooners of eight guns 
and a brig mounting ten guns, which were ranged in order of battle, at secure moorings, inside of a 
long range of rocks and shoals, extending more than two miles to the eastward of the town. These 
shoals protected the enemy from the northern gales, and rendered it impossible for a frigate to ap- 
proach near enough to destroy them. Each gun-boat mounted a heavy eighteen, or twenty-six 
pounder in the bow, and two brass howitzers on the quarters, and carried from thirty-six to fifty men. 
The galleys had each one hundred men, and the schooners and brigs were '^"'nn°':'^"-!'hfi same 
number. 

The weather continued unfavorable until the 28th, when the fleet stood in ; but just as the Con- 
stitution anchored, a sudden change made it necessary for them to retire, and swiftly they dashed 
along that rocky shore before the breath of a terrific gale. This gale continued until the 31st, when 
it blew away the Constitution's foresail and close-reefed maintopsail, and had the sea risen in pro- 
portion to the wind, the gunboats and bombs would have been carried down to the charnel house of 
the mariner. 

On the 3d of August, at noon, the commodore, having formed his plan of attack, made signal for 
the different commanders to come withm hail. After communicating his orders to them, he wore 
ship, and stood in for the batteries. At half-past two, he made the general signal for battle. In an 
instant, the enemy's shipping and batteries opened a tremendous fire, which was promptly returned 
within grape shot distance. Several times the Constitution was within two cables' length of the 
rocks, and within three of their batteries. Every battery was silenced so long as the frigate's broad- 
side bore upon them, but as often as she passed by, they were reanimated, and a constant heavy fire 
kept up upon her. At this time, in sheering and tacking, the gallant commodore felt most sensibly 
the want of another frigate. 

At half past four, the wind inclining to the northward, signal w^as made to retire from the batter- 
ies, which was done under cover of the Constitution's heavy cannon. For two hours this noble 
frigate stood the close fire of the batteries, and the only damages received by her were a wound fromt 
a twenty-four pound shot in her mainmast, thirty feet from the deck, the loss of her mainroyal sail 
and yard, which were shot av/ay, and the dismounting of a quarter-deck gun by a thirty-two' pound 
shot, which at the same time shattered a marine's arm. 

Thus came out, under the protecting wing of our favorite, the gallant squadron, at the hour of 
sunset, from before Tripoli, and, in the words of the brave commander, we must impute their get- 
ting off so well to their having kept so near the batteries of the enemy, and to their having annoyed 
them so excessively with their grape shot. 

On the 5th August, the squadron was at anchor about two leagues north from the city of Tripoli,, 
while the Argus was in chase of a small vessel to the westward, which she soon came up with, and 
brought within hail. She proved to be a French privateer, of four guns, which put into Tripoli a 
few days previous for water, and had left it that morning. Commodore Preble prevailed upon the 
captain, for a con-sid-er-a-tion, to return to Tripoli, for the purpose of landing fourteen very badly 
wounded Tripolitans, whom he put on board his vessel, with a letter to the prime minister, leaving 
it at the option of the bashaw to reciprocate so generous a mode of conducting the war. On the 
7th of August, the Frenchman returned to the Constitution, and brought commodore Preble a let- 
ter from the French consul, in which he observed that the attack of the 3d instant had disposed the

bashaw to accept of reasonable teims, and invited him to send a boat to the rocks with a flag of 
truce, which the commodore declined, as the white flag was not hoisted at the bashaw's castle. 

At 9, A. M., with a very light breeze from the eastward, and a strong current, which obliged the 
Constitution to remain at anchor, the commodore made the signal for the light vessels to weigh, and 
the gun and bomb-boats to cast off and stand in shore, towards the western batteries, the prize boats 
having been completely fitted for service, and the command of them given to lieutenants Crane, of 
the Vixen, Thorn, of the Enteiprize, and Caldwell, of the Syren. The whole advanced with sails 
and oars. 

At half past one, with a breeze from north north-east, Old Ironsides (for she received her soh'i- 
quet in this bombardment) weighed and stood in for the town, but the wind being on shore, made 
it imprudent to engage the batteries with the ship, as, in case of a mast being shot away, the loss of 
the vessel would probably ensue, unless a change of wind should favor her retreat. 

On the 28th, the Constitution approached the harbor. Fort English, the bashaw's castle, and the 
Crown and Mole batteries, kept up a heavy fire upon her as she advanced. At half-past five, she 
was within two cables' lengths of the rocks, and commenced a heavy fire of round and grape on 
thirteen of the enemy's gunboats and galleys, which were in pretty close action with the guirboats 
of the squadron. She sank one of the enemy's gunboats ; at the same time, two more, that had been 
disabled, ran on shore to avoid sinking ; the remainder immediatelj' retreated. 

The old ship still continued running in until within musket shot of the Crown and Mole batteries, 
when she brought to, and fired upwards of three hundred round shot, besides grape and cannister, 
into the town, the bashaw's castle and batteries, silencing the castle and two of the batteries for some 
time. In all this unprecedented exposvue to the deadly aim of a land battery, the frigate was only 
injured in her sails and rigging — her hull being but slightly peppered with grape shot. 

On the 3d, the Constitution, to draw oft" the enemy's attention from the gunboats, ran within 
them. She brought to within reach of grape, and fired eleven broadsides into the bashaw's castle, 
town and batteries, m a situation where more than seventy guns could bear upon her. 

She did not get out scatheless from this fight ; her maintopsail was totally disabled by a shell from 
the batteries which cut away the leach rope, and several cloths of the sail. Another shell went 
through the foretopsail, and one through the jib. All her sails were considerably cut and her run- 
ning rif"- ' -' "erv v;.&gt;* ^i injured, but still no shot was received in the hull. 

Iiiub ended the Constitution's services before Tripoli for the season ; and, if ever a vessel earned 
a name, she earned the one which we have used in our title-page. 

" During this attack, a thirty-two pound ball from the (Constitution passed through the wall in the 
apartment of the prison where captain Bainbridge was sleeping, struck against the opposite wall, 
rebounded, and in its fall took part of the bed-clothes from him, and passed within a few inches of 
his body. In its passage through the first wall it knocked out a cart-load of stone and mortar, un- 
der which captain Bainbridge was buried until the officers relieved him. He was considerably bruis- 
ed by the rubbish, and received a cut in the right ankle which occasioned a lameness for months."* 

What must have been the feelings of Bainbridge, Porter, Jones, etc., as they lay within their 
gloomy prison-house and heard the thunder of their country's cannon dying amid the fastrresses of 
Barbaiy, and felt the rubbish rattling upon their heads, as the iron messengers of vengeance came 
sweeping through the massive walls with the swiftness of the lightning's flash ! 

This series of bombardments caused the haughty bashaw to come to terms, and the next year a 
treaty was signed on board the frigate — the first instance where a peace was concluded with any of 
the Barbary states on board a ship of war. 

In giving an account of the Constitution's warfare with the Tripolitans, I have followed commo- 
dore Preble's letter to the Secretary of the Navy, and avoided, as much as possible, the manoeuvres 
and actions of other vessels and other crews. My subject is simply the life of one gallant ship — 
and those who wish for more may look for it in Goldsborough's Naval Chronicle.

N OPINION ON DREAMS. 



VAnrotrs opinions have been hazarded concerning dreams — ^whether they have any connection 
with the invisible and eternal world or not ; and, it appears to me, the reason why nothings like a 
definite conclusion has yet been arrived at, is from the circumstance of the arguers never making any 
distinction between Mind and Soul; always speaking of them as one and the same. I believe man 
to be in himself a Trinity, viz. Mind, Body, and Soul; and thus with dreams, some induced by the 
mind, and some by the soul. Those connected with the mind, I think proceed partly from super- 
natural, and partly from natural causes ; those of the soul I believe are of the immaterial world alone. 

In order to support this position, it becomes necessary to show how the soul's dream and that of 
the mind are distinguishable ; and whether sometimes, or indeed often, they are not both at the same 
moment bearing their part in the nocturnal vision. 

That dreams, or, as they were then generally called, visions, were a means of supernatural in- 
struction, if we believe the bible at all, is proved by Jacob's dream, the several visions of Ezekiel and 
other prophets, as also of later date, the Eevelations to Saint John ; and there appears no reason why 
this mode of divine communication should be discontinued in the present day 

We thus come to the difference between dreams of the mind and wjs/ons of the soul — making this 
distinction of terms, not only on account of convenience, but also, as I consider, of applicability. 
Upon retiring to rest after a fatiguing day of either corporeal or mental exertion, should a dream 
present itself either as recapitulatory of, or connected with, the past events, this I should say was 
produced by the immaterial mind, which, unlike the body, was still in a state of vigor and activity ; 
and reflecting or re-enacting at night the scenes which had occupied its attention and energies during 
the day. But when slumbering, should a vision be induced either concerning Heaven or Hell, or 
any mystical and apparently prophetical forewarning of a coming event, and in connection with 
which the awakened visionist can trace no analogy to his thoughts or actions, this, I say, must 
proceed from the soul ; as the mind cannot have any thing to do with that it has not been engaged 
upon, as we all know that the mind only expands, and is active in proportion to its various degrees 
of employment. Not so the soul ; that of the infant is as ripe as the man's ; it is as immortal and as 
ready for Heaven ; and I have known children have nightly visions which were as evidently superior 
to the general tenor of their youthful ideas as possible, and which, had they not for the time being 
appeared to have had their mental powers raised above their usual level, they would have been to- 
tally unable to narrate. 

It is a question, in my humble opinion, whether the soul ever slumbers at all ; whilst the mind 
evidently does, or else we could always give upon waking some relation of our thought's employment 
during sleep. Besides which, it not unfrequently happens that when broad awake, a temporary 
absence of mind as it is called, takes place, and the person so affected cannot with all his endeavors 
discover upon what his meditations have been employed, or whether they have been so at all. Thus 
three portions of the one man seem to be most essentially different, in this way ; that the body often 
sleeps, the mind occasionally, the soul never ; and now I am expected to explain how, if the soul 
never sleeps, we have not always some vision to employ our waking consideration. I imagine that 
here in order to remember the vision of our soul, it is necessary for the connecting link between it 
and the body, viz. the mind, to be in full activity, although possessing its powers of memory from 
the eternal nature of its superior, and companion, the soul ; thus rendering it no difficulty to the 
mind to retain the reminiscence of its own dream, as the soul never sleeps ; which assertion may re- 
ceive additional confirmation from the following argument ; that were it only for one single moment 
to be unconscious of its existence, this would at once break in upon its eternal principle, as being a 
suspension of its own powers, and which cannot happen to eternity. It is the slumber of the mind 
and not the soul, therefore, which causes forgetfulneas.

MATION AMONG OUR BRITISH PROGENITORS ITS MODERN REGULATIONS AS A PASTIME ITS 

TAllIOUS IMPXE31ENTS, AND THEIR USE. 



In our own country, the practice of archery as a pastime has met with a very trivial encourage- 
ment. We are, beyond doubt, too much a nation of matter-of-fact to indulge very largely in amuse- 
ments of any kind; and archery, and most other of the manly pastimes (with perhaps the single ex- 
ception of the race) have succumbed beneath the saturnine dominion of the genius of dollars and 
cents. Better times, however, may supervene, ami for our own parts we shall welcome them with 
a hearty good will. We proceed to give, briefly, some general regulations touching the practice of 
modern archery — with a description of the implements and the method of their use, as well as the 
precautions to be used in their selection. 

THE BOW. 

The woods of which bows are now generally made are very numerous. The chief of them are 
rose-wood, lance-wood, and yew, the last being by far the best of the three, but from the difficulty of 
obtaining a bough of sufficient size, and possessing the necessary qualities, yew bows are by far the 
most expensive. 

Several foreign woods, used for the purposes of dyeing and cabinet-making are very suitable for 
bows, such as fustic, rose-wood, etc.; that of the cocoa tree answers very well for making strong bows. 

Formerly hows were made of both steel and iron, as well as of the horns of animals so fastened 
together as to secure their curved form and their elasticity. The woods above noticed have now 
altogether superseded these plans, the last of which was chiefly adopted among the Persians and 
Turks. 

The best bows are made of two pieces, — the flat and outward part, which is called the back, and 
the round and inward part, teimed the belly. When these bows are manufactured they are put into 
a reflex frame in order to make them turn a little backward, a foim which gives them a greater ve- 
locity in shooting. This circumstance has frequently occasioned some very unpleasant mistakes, for 
the strength of the round piece, which is the very means of giving the bow its power, naturally 
compels the flat piece to fall back, and thus bows have been strung the WTong way, and consequently 
been injured ; for, when so bent, the slightest stress will break them. When being strung the bow 
should always be bent with the flat part outwards. Old Roger Ascham's advice upon the choice of 
a bow is not bad. He says, " If you come into a shoppe, and find a bowe that is small, longe, heavye, 
and strong, lying streighte, not windinge, not marred with knotte, gaule, winde shake, wem, freat, 
or pinch, bye that bowe of my warrante. The best color of a bowe that I finde, is when the back 
and the belleye in workinge be much after one maner, for such often times in wearing do prove like 
virgin wax or golde, having fine longe graine, even from one end of the bowe to the other. The 
short graine, although such prove well sometimes, are for the most part very brittle." Such was old 
Roger's advice, and the counsel holds good to the present day. 



ARCHERY. 107 

It is especially necessary that the bow be well seasoned. Among the foreign woods the Ruby, as 
it is called, is considered by far the best. It is found in the East, difficult to be obtained, and highly 
prized by the bow makers. The tulip wood, cocoa-wood, thorn acacia, the purple wood, and the rose- 
wood, when backed with line white hickory, or horn-beam, make excellent bows. Next to yew, 
lancewood is the best, and perhaps more elegant. Foreign yew, however, incontestably forms by far 
the best bow, especially when backed by hickory. 

Nor is the form of the bow of much less consequence. Its curve, when the aiiow is pulled to the 
head, ought to be a perfect semicircle. This has of necessity been much the same among all nations, 
and in all ages. The Persian bow is short, being scarcely longer than the arm of a man, and is 
frequently made of the horns of the antelope. The Chinese-Tartarian bows vary from three to five 
feet in length when bent; the largest possess prodigious power, and are said to be capable of casting 
an arrow full five hundred yards, and will allow arrows of thirty-three or thirty-foui inches in length 
to be drawn quite up to the head. 

The length of the bow should be for a gentleman five feet eight to five feet ten inches, but six feet 
is even better than either of these two sizes — a lady's bow should be from five feet, to five feet six 
inches ; the former varying from forty-five pounds to seventy pounds, and upwards, and the latter 
seldom exceeding thirty-four pounds. Every bow has a mark upon it to indicate the weight requi- 
site to draw it home to the head ; and if it be recollected that just twice as much power is required 
as is marked on the bow, every one may easily ascertain his own strength. 

PROVING THE BOW. 

Having selected your bow, the next object is to ascertain that your judgment of it is correct. This 
is done by what is ieimeA proving. Every bow, as we have stated, is of some particular strength ; 
what that is, is learned by attaching weights to the string, when the bow is strung, until the bow is 
brought to such a curve as would draw the arrow to its head. Having done this, shoot for a little 
time with arrows in it twice the weight of those usually required, and then observe if it gives at all, 
and if it does, have that part strengthened, or change the bow. 

THE STRING. 

This is a very material part of the bowman's apparatus, as the safety of the bow in great part de- 
pends on its firmness. The concussion which the fracture of the string causes in the bow never fails 
either at the moment to shatter it in pieces, or to raise splinters, which, becoming deeper as the bow 
is used, speedily destroy the instrument. 

The strings used by the ancients seem to have been made of thongs of leather, cut chiefly from 
the fresh hides of bulls and other animals, as also from the intestines. Many strings now used are 
made of the latter, and are composed of numerous small cords extending the whole length, and 
bound here and there with silk to keep them together, and these have been found by practical archers 
to possess more strength than a single string of the same external dimensions. 

The material, however, of which the string is now usually made in England is hemp ; and the 
Italian species is best for the purpose. Catgut is considered too much under the influence of heat 
and moisture to retain at all times a proper tension ; while the former has not this disadvantageous 
quality in so great a degree. 

Care should be taken in selecting strings, to observe that the substance of the string diminishes 
gradually from the thick part to the ordinary line, and that there are no knobs or unevennessin that 
part used for shooting. The choice of the string will depend upon the strength of the bow. A thick 
string will shoot with most certainty, but a thin string will cast farther. The choice, however, is a 
matter of indifference, provided the string selected be not decidedly too thin for the strength of the 
bow, particularly if the bow be a backed one, and much reflexed, for many a good bow has been 
broken in consequence of the sudden jerk occasioned by the breaking of the string. 

The string should always be whipped with silk or fine twine at the nocking point, and also about 
the breadth of three fingers both above and below that point. The whipping as well as the string 
should be well waxed with bees'-wax ; and that will not only secure the string from being fretted 
but will tend to fill the nock of the arrow, which ought always to sit rather tightly on the stririg. It 
would be also advisable to whip the eye, and if after trial the string be found worthy, it would be ail 
the better for doing so, but attention to this particular is not so necessary as at the nocking point, 
where there is more wear. But to the noose it is a matter of far greater importance, for that is 
much more likely to fret than the eye. As soon as the silk or twine wears off, the string should be 
rewhipped. 

STRINGING. 

The next thing is to acquire a proper mode of bending the bow, for otherwise in the very fiist 
attempt it will probably be strained if not broken. We should again observe that the round part of 
the bow it is which should be bent inwards; that is called the belly of the bow ; the flat part, or back, 



108 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

should be bent outwards. Having paiticularly observed this, take the bow by the handle into the 
right hand ; let the lower end of the bow be placed against the inside of the right foot, (the lower 
end of the bow has always the shortest horn,) the foot being turned to prevent the bow from slipping. 
Keep the wrist firmly pressed to your side, so that the strength required in the left wiist to press 
down the upper limb cannot force the right wrist from its incumbent position ; place the centre of 
the left wrist upon the upper limb of the bow close under the eye of the string, keeping the arm 
quite straight — the tip of the thumb should be on one edge of the bow, and the knuckle of the fore- 
finger on the other. Pull the bow briskly with the right hand, and press the upper limb down with 
the left, sliding the wrist upwards towards the horn, while the tip of the thumb and the knuckle of 
the finger drive the eye of the string into the nock ; the string must be fairly in the nock before the 
left hand is removed. The three last fingers may be stretched out, as they are not wanted, for if they 
get between the string and the bow they may receive a severe pinch. To preserve a steadiness of 
position, have the right foot placed against a wall or some other stable support, the left foot being 
brought about a yard forward, the right knee may be bent, but the left must be kept as straight as 
possible ; a supposition may perhaps arise, in consequence of a failure to string in the first two or 
three attempts of the learner, that the bow is too strong for him ; but this will in all probability be a 
mistake, for it is not strength that is so much required as a knack — a right knowledge of performing 
the operation, and facility in its execution. Before attempting to string the bow he careful that the 
string is not twisted round it, and that the noose is in the centre of the horn. 

Should the string not be quite straight the defect may be remedied by first slackening it as in the 
act of unstringing, by pulling the bow up a little with the right hand, and pressing down the upper 
limb with the left, and then by twisting the noose to the right or left as may be required. 

THEARROW. 

The use of the long bow has now so entirely superseded that of its complex rival that it appears 
almost unnecessary to speak of any arrows but such as are fitted to use with it, yet it may not be 
improper to notice briefly, e?ij5C!.&lt;'sani, the several kinds of instruments used in this very ancient 
mode of offence and defence. It is a singular fact, that the bow, as a weapon of war, appears to have 
been almost altogether confined to the Teutonic races. It is true that among some of the nations of 
Northern Africa, it has occasionally been used, and that among both the Greeks and Romans it was 
eometimes employed, but was never so efficient an arm to them as it was among the Parthians and 
the other tribes of North Western Asia, and the districts of Europe adjoining them, the inhabitants 
of which were in alliance with them. Through the connection between that people and the several 
laces which occupied the northern countries of Europe be very obscuredly traced in history, ws- 
cannot but think that the evidence of it is sufficiently clear as to establish their identity. Among 
tliem, the short arrow and bow, the former from eighteen inches to two feet long, and the latter 
measuring about a yard, were the common weapons, and were thus used among them, until their in- 
dividual existence as a people was lost in the gieat stream of modern population. In Britain it was 
the first form of the bow and arrow introduced, and continued in use here certainly till within a little 
time prior to the Norman conquest, and there is little doubt was chiefly and certainly used in En- 
gland for a century, and perhaps for a century and a half, after that epoch. In Scotland, indeed, it 
appears never to have been changed for any other. But the use of the long bow in the hands of the 
English archers at Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt, besides several other great engagements, so 
completely established its superiority that it quickly and almost entirely superseded any other form. 
The cloth yard shafts of Britain darkened many a sky, and seldom failed to carry death upon their 
wings ; and though the use of them as weapons of war has long been discontinued, they are too close- 
ly connected with the glorious associations of the national annals to be forgotten and disregarded, 
and will long continue, as they now are, a favorite means of noble sport and recreation. 

Arrows are made of weight and length proportionate to the size and strength of bows. Arrows 
for bows of five feet long are twenty-four inches in length. Bows under five feet nine inches have 
arrows twenty-seven inches in length ; and above five feet nine inches, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, 
and sometimes thirty inches long. But the last is an extreme length, seldom necessary and seldom 
used ; beyond the power of most men to draw them up to the head, and, to say the least of them, 
dangerous to the bow. Even arrows of twenty-nine inches long are inconvenient if not hazardous. 
Bows of five feet ten inches in length should never have an arrow longer than twenty-eight inches 
used with them. 

Different nations have used different substances in the fabrication of their arrows, though reeds 
have been most common. Dogwood, or the cornelian cherry, were formerly much used in their 
manufacture, as well as for javehns; but the calamus was much piized for the purpose, on account 
of its weight, which enabled it to resist the air, and consequently rendered it more obedient to the 
impetus given by the bow. 

Sheaf, or war arrows were, it seems, generally made of ash ; for Ascham observes that it were 
better to make them of good ash, and not of the aspen, as of all woods he ever proved, ash he found 
the best and swiftest, as well as the most effective, from the weight of the wood, aspen being muck

inferior. " The stele," (the arrow without feather or head,) he says, " should be made as the grain 
lies, or it will never fly straight ; and knots ought to be carefully avoided, as a knotty stele is more 
liable to break, and does not fly so far, because the strength of the shoot is hindered and stopped by 
the knot. It is better to have the shaft a little too short than over long, somewhat too light than over 
lumpish, a little too small than a great deal too large." The shdft must be perfectly round, as it is 
the best shape both for swiftness and for most easily piercing any thing. Arrows are now usually 
made of red deal, ash, and a light white wood, very much like that of the lime and abele trees. 
Fletchers hold the first in high estimation ; it wears quickly and is apt to splinter, and should there- 
fore for protection be varnished two or three times over. Mr. Hastings says that lime is an excellent 
wood for arrows, and that those arrows fly farthest and cleanest through the air which are perfectly 
round, rather high chested, or tapeiing in a very small degree from the shoulder or close of the pile 
to the nock, taking care that the pile be not heavier than will cause the arrow, when completed, to 
balance on the finger about one third or a little more of the way from the pile to the nock, or rather 
more than halfway frjm the nock to the pile. 




COSTUME OF THE UNITED BOWMEN OF PHILADELPHIA. 

The weight of an arrow is the next consideration. It is the usual practice in England, to weigh 
arrows against silver money at the mint standard weight ; thus it has been ascertained that the weight 
of an arrow is from three to twenty shillings, though they are seldom used heaviei than five. Roberts, 
in his " English Bowman," gives the following directions for ariows to shoot with at a particular 
distance: 30 yards, from is. to 6.?., 60, 3s. (\d. to ^s. ed., 90, to 120, 3s. to 4s. 6d. Thus it would 
appear that an arrow of the weight of 5s. would be about light for the generality of distances, but this 
of course depends much both upon the bow and the shooter, and much acute attention is required to 
ascertain the precise weight fitted for every occasion. We are induced to notice this matter par- 
ticularly, because the success of archery mainly depends upon it, and a perfect knowledge of it is only 
to be acquired by practice and close attention. One thing should be observed, that arrows for par- 
ticular distances should be selected and set apait. 

THE FEATHER. 

It has been well obseived that nothing is of so much consequence as the feathei of the arrow, and 



110 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

the truth of the observation will at once be perceived, when it is recollected that this is the wing by 
which the arrow flies, and that upon this the steadiness and velocity of its flight depends. The best 
feather is from the wing of the gray goose, and it has been celebrated by both historians and poets, 
though we believe it to be equalled by that of the tuikey, and surpassed by that of the eagle. This 
IS natural, for strength and elasticity are the prime requisites in the feather of an arrow ; and thesis 
qualities are found in a very superior degree in the feathers of the eagle. Of the goose's wing, the 
second, third, and fourth feathers are those most esteemed. The featheis should not be drawn, but 
pared with a fine sharp knife, and afterwards cut into proper length and shape. The length of the 
feather for arrows of twenty-seven inches long, exclusive of the pile, and of 4s. or 4s. 6d. weight, 
should be four and a half inches, or four and five-eighths, and set on the shaft about one and a quarter 
inches, or one and three-eighths from the extreme end of the nock, the feather being there three- 
fiighths of an inch, and finely tiimmed to the end. Should the shaft be a very heavy one, the feather 
must be made proportionably strong. A lady's arrow, which is lighter, should of course have a fea- 
ther proportionably small. It should be particularly observed, to select the feathers from the right or 
the left wing, that is, the smooth side should always be kept the same way. The archer will find it 
necessary to have both sorts with him, as the arrow in its rotatory motion through the air is much 
influenced by a side wind. The resistance of the feather is on its convex side, and therefore those 
arrows should be used which are fletched with feathers having the convex towards that side whence 
the wind comes. 

THE PILE OF THE ARROW. 

The pile is the hard part, composed of whatever it may be, placed at the end of the arrow, and in- 
tended to pierce any substance against which it may be shot. The term is derived from the Latin 
■word pila, a ball, and came to be used from the practice of those people, who, in the time of Henry 
VII., lived within the range of the ro3'al forests, and were compelled to use round-headed arrows on 
account of the deer. It is in general made of some metal. Among some of the ancients brass was 
in much request. The Flemish arrows are at this day tipt with horn, as their laws prohibit the use 
of iron or steel for that purpose. The latter substances are those which have been, and are still most 
commonly used, tempered to the degree requisite to pierce the textvxre against which it is intended 
to be used. The piles of arrows for the pastime of archery should be made round, of thin steel, or 
very hard iron, about three-quarters of an inch in length, with the barbs just wide enough apart to 
admit the shaft, after having been filed sufficiently down to go up to the extremity of the pile. 

When tlie wind is against him, or boisterous, the archer will find the blunt-headed arrows the 
best ; but with a wind, and favorable for the flight, a sharp pile will be found preferable. 

THE NOCK OF THE ARROW. 

The nock is that part of the arrow fitted for the string. This is generally inlaid with horn, and 
•should have the nick wide enough to fit on the string easily, but not loosely. Arrows should be 
chosen with the nock too narrow rather than otherwise, as that is a defect which can soon be reme- 
died by the use of a file, while too wide a nock is both inconvenient and disagreeable, and most pro- 
bably uncertain, and farther, is a fault which cannot be amended. The nock should also be as smooth 
as possible. 

THE QUIVER 

Is generally made of leather or tin, and should be deep enough to take in the arrows nearly up to 
the feather. Wood or leather were the substances used for making it in former times, but they have 
now been superseded by tin, which is both lighter and more impermeable to wet. It should be large 
enough to carry from eight to a dozen arrows. The quiver is never worn, except in roving. In 
shooting at targets, oi butts, it is placed a few yards beside them, three arrows being all that are re- 
quired for present use. The rest are kept in reserve, to supply the place of those which may meet 
with accidents. The quiver should be carried on the right side behind. 

THE BRACER. 

This article is made of leather, and buckles round the arm of the archer, answering two purposes ; 
■viz., preserving the arm from the violent stroke of the string in loosing, and from its smooth surface 
allowing the string to glide freely, and without the hindrances that an ordinary cloth sleeve presents. 
The pain infhcted by the string, upon an arm unprotected by the biacer, is sufficient to disable the 
bowman from the farther immediate use of his bow. 

THE BELT AND TASSEL. 

The belt is generally made of cow-hide leather, with a well or pouch to receive the pile heads of 
the arrows, through a leathern loop. It buckles round the waist, with the pouch on the right side, 
and a tassel made of green worsted, for wiping the dirt off the arrows, on the other. The tassel should 
he used as soon as the airow is drawn from the ground. 



Ill ARCHERY. 

THE TARGET. 

The diameter of a gentleman's target, from the extremity of the outer white circle, is four feet, and 
all shots beyond that are not considered as being within the target. Ladies' targets are made on the 
same principle, but considerably smaller, generally about three feet in diameter. Targets are often 
made of millboard, which, though not nearly so durable as the others, are more convenient for 
carrying about, as a boy can with ease bear them for a considerable distance. There should always 
be a pair in the field, as it shortens the walk, and reduces the trouble to shoot backwards and for- 
wards, instead of shooting at one target. The colors are a gold eye, surrounded by a red circle, that 
by a white one, that circumscribsd by a black one, and that again by the white: each of these pos- 
sesses a value proportional to its nearness to the centre. The margin of the target is called the petti- 
coat. 

DISTANCE FOR TARGET SHOOTING. 

The usual distance prescribed is, for gentlemen, one hundred yards, and for ladies fifty. It is 
better, however, for gentlemen to begin at seventy yards, or at most eighty, than with the whole dis- 
tance at once. 

ATTITUDE. 

This is of very much more consequence than the inexperiened archer would at first suppose. In 
doing a thing well, especially in a pastime, it is always worth while to do it gracefully also, for that 
is not only pleasing, but often useful. The most graceful position is that in which the nund has 
most complete command over the motions of the limbs. Ascham says the attitude should be 
such, " as shall be both pleasing to the eye of the beholder, and advantageous to the shooter, setting 
his countenance, and all parts of his body in such a manner and position, that both all his strength 
may be employed most to advantage, and his shot made and managed to other men's pleasure and 
delight. A man must not go hastily about it, nor yet make too much ado about it ; one foot must 
not stand too far from the other, lest he stoop too much, which is unbecoming, nor yet too near the 
other, lest he should stand too upright, for so a man shall neither use his strength well, noryet stand 
steadfastly. The mean betwixt both must be kept ; a thing more pleasant to behold when it is done, 
than to be taught how it should be done." 

The archer should place himself in such a manner, that the side of his body should be towards the 
mark, so that if the target be due north, he may face directly to the east, holding the bow horizontally, 
with the string upwards. Thus standing, he is prepared for 

DRAWING THE BOW. 

The arrow being thus placed and steadily held, the archer, with his feet nearly squared, and abou^ 
eight or ten inches apart, commences the operation of drawing. Gradually pressing the bow down 
with his left hand, he draws at the same time the string with his light, and keeping his right elbow 
well up, gracefully raises his arms, his left extended with his bow, the wrist turned rather inwards, 
and the right drawing the string till the arrow be brought up about half way. The arrow being 
sufficiently raised'according to the distance of the mark, it should be drawn up to the pile, and then, 
with a moment's aim (for that ought to be sufficient, and more would be injurious) the archer lets 
fly, with a steady and sharp loose. 

- O F T A K I N G A I M . 

Of all exercises, coolness, attention, and confidence is most required in Archery, and few things 
are more affected in their success by the state of the animal spirits. Much judgment is necessary in 
taking aim, and it is especially requisite that a proper " length" should be taken. Many archers have 
a custom of looking down their arrows at the mark, but the best authorities seem agreed that the 
right plan is to keep the eye steadily fixed on the mark, and our high authority, Ascham, especially. 
He says, " For having a man's eye always on his mark is the only wav to shoot straight, yea, and I 
suppose so redye and easy a way, if it be learned in youth and confirmed with use, that a man shall 
never miss therein." The supposition that a more correct sight is obtained by looking down the shaft 
is erroneous ; doing so only distracts the attention. 

The whole of these motions are of course but parts of one continuous effort, and the more evenly 
it can be performed the better. Drawing is one of the very nicest points in archery — Old Roger 
calls it " the best part of shootinge," and should be done as precisely as possible, with the utmost 
steadiness. If the fingers embrace the stiing too much, it will twist, and the arrow fly wide of its 
mark. It ought to have the string in a truly right line. In target shooting the nock of the arrow is 
brought a little under the ear, but in long shots the arrow has to describe a greater curve, and the 
drawing hand must consequently be more depressed, so that the nock of the arrow may be brought 
down towards the right breast. 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 



Concealment. A Novel. Two Volumes. Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

This novel is of ihe Billy Lackaday school of perfection — full of Anna Marias, angelic captains, 
and seraphic situations. The author has indulged in the concealment of his name — if the booksel- 
lers had indulged in the concealment of the novel, the injured public would have been saved the in- 
fliction of considerable twaddle. We pity the poor creature, who, on a lainy day, has no other book 
at hand than this same novel of" Concealment !" 



Phantasmio7i, Prince of Palmland. Iwo Volumes. S. Colman, New York. 

These volumes form the first issue of a Library of Romance, edited by Grenville Mellen, and pub- 
lished by Mr. Colman. The editor, in his introduction, speaks of the merits of Phantasmion with 
most exaggerated emphasis ; but, with due respect to Mr, Mellen's acknowledged judgment, we can- 
not give our assent to the praises he has bestowed upon the work before us. It is, at best, but a 
pretty puerility — a concoction of stale magicals, and fairy fancies, interspersed with some dainty con- 
ceits, and a few pieces of excellent poetry. Notwithstanding the clear definition of the fitness of 
simplicity, in the well-written introduction by the editor, and his assertion that Phantasmion is made 
to touch, with a masterly wand, every spirit that loves to indulge in unrestrained pilgrimage through 
the land of the free and the fanciful, we aver that the simplicity of Phantasmion frequently degene- 
rates into positive inanity, and that the intense passages trench most closely upon the realms of 
verbiage and fustian. In support of our assertions, we append a brace of quotations. 

First, for the " good taste" of the simplicity : — 

" While the old man stood talking to larine, describing with lively gestures the battle of tigers, 
the braying of horns, the crashing of boughs, and the yelling of wounded beasts, many of his sheep, 
as if glad to steal away from the oft-told tale, had straggled into the woody glen, which was full 
of soft herbage, and larine offered to guard the main body of his flock while he went in search of 
the truants ; so thanking her for that courtesy, taking a weapon of defence from his girdle, and 
placing his crook in her hand, he hastened away. The lovely princess led the flock slowly onward 
till she arrived at a stream, which crossed the dell, and had been swollen by sudden rains to a tor- 
rent : here she paused, waiting for the shepherd, and, while the sheep eyed the water, thinking per- 
chance of a ford lower down, where they had crossed in the morning, larine's mind had*ravelled 
back to her father and Albinet, thence to her baby brother, and all the time was not wholly absent 
from Phantasmion. At last, she began to think that the old man was long away, and looked up 
with pleasure when she heard footsteps advancing ; but he who now stood before her was more like 
a king than a rustic swain ; his attire, though black, was costly, his countenance abstracted and 
grave. He stopped to look at larine, as she lifted up a dripping lamb which had slipped into the 
water, and, seeing that she eyed him anxiously, as if desirous yet afraid to speak, (for indeed she 
■wished to inquire whether he had seen the shepherd,) his eye lit up with expectation, and in an 
eager tone he exclaimed — ' Hast thou aught to tell me of the silver pitcher ?^ " 

Now, for a specimen of the much-lauded " gorgeousness and exuberance: — " 

" But lo ! the sun has broken through its hazy veil, and Feydeleen's soft cheek, as if it faded in 
the brilliant light, is seen no more among the blossoms ; Albinet raises his head, from which the 
airy chaplet melts away, and with wonder-stricken eyes Eurelio gazes upward, for Potentilla has 
risen from his side. A moment yet the wings of her insect steeds are painted against the background 
of one lingering cloudlet — but now they disappear, while earth below, suffused with splendor, be- 
comes a softened image of the heavens themselves."

We give, in justice, a specimen of the poetry, which is excellent, but scarcely powerful enough 
to warrant the resuscitation of this tedious romance. 



By the storm invaded 
Ere thy arch was wrought, 
Rainbow, thou hast faded 
Like a gladsome thought, 
And ne'er mayst shine aloft in all earth's colors 
fraught. 

Insect, tranced forever 
In thy pendent bed. 
Which the breezes sever 
From its fragile thread, 
Thou ne'er shall burst thy cell and crumpled pi- 
nions spread. 

Their armor is flashing 

And linging and clashing. 

Their looks are wild and savage ! 

With deeds of night 

They have daiken'd the light, 

They are come from reckless ravage ! 

O bountiful Earth, 

With famine and dearth, 

With plague and fire surround them ; 

Thy womb they have torn 

With impious scorn ; 

Let its tremblings now confound them ! 

Our cause maintain — 

For as dew to the plain, 

Or wind to the slumbering sea. 

Or sunny sheen 

To woodlands green, 

So dear have we been to thee. 

The new-blown flowers, 

From thy fairest bowers, 

Their rifling hands have taken ; 

And the tree's last crop, 

That was ready to drop. 

From the dews have rudely shaken ; 

Through deep green dells, 

Where the bright stream wells, 

Like diamond with emerald blending ; 

Through sheltered vales, 

Where the light wind sails. 

High cedars scarcely bending ; 

Through lawn and grove. 

Where the wild deer rove. 

They have rushed like a burning flood ; 

For morning's beam. 

Or the starry gleam. 

Came fire, and sword, and blood. 



Lily, born and nourish'd 
'Mid the waters cold, 
Where thy green leaves flourish'd, 
On the sunburnt mould, 
How canst thou rear thy stem and sallow buds 
unfold ? 

Snowy cloud, suspended 
0"ei the orb of light, 
With its radiance blended 
Ne'er to glisten bright, 
It sinks, and thou grow'st black beneath the wing© 
of night. 

Then lend us thy might, 

Great Earth, for the fight, 

O help us to quell their pride : 

Make our sinews and bones 

As firm as the stones. 

And metals that gird thy side ; 

May the smould'ring mountains, 

And fiery fountains 

Inflame our vengeful ire, 

And beasts that lurk 

In thy forests murk. 

Their tameless rage inspire ; 

While from caves of death 

Let a sluggish breath 

O'er the spoilers' spirits creep. 

send to their veins '■ 

The chill that reigns ^ 

In thy channels dark and deep. 

But if those we abhor 

Must triumph in war. 

Let us sink to thy inmost centre. 

Where the trump's loud sound, 

Nor the tramp and the bound, 

Nor the conqueror's shout can enter ; 

Let mountainous rocks, 

By earthquake shocks. 

High o'er our bones be lifted ; 

And piles of snow, 

Where we sleep below, 

To the plains above be drifted ; 

If the muiderous band 

Must dwell in the land, 

And the fields we loved to cherish. 

From the land of balm 

Let cedar and palm 

With those that rear'd them perish. 



The Barber of Paris ,- or Moral Retribution. By Paul de Kock, author of "Andrew the Savoy' 
ard," " Good Fellow," etc. Two Volumes. Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

Paul de Kock occasionally receives a good share of abuse from various of the English critics of 
the newly-raised school of elegance and aristocracy — who delight to see mankind in embroidered 
coats and satin smalls, and vote every man a mauvais sujet who does not figure in silk stockings. 
A novel, must, to be good in their estimation, be devoted to the sayings and doings of the fashiona- 
ble world — a close portrayal of human nature is of small avail, unless the characteristics of high life

form the text — in other words, the sterling value of the metal is not of so much importance as the 
fashion of the make. 

There are other writers who, descending to the opposite extreme, revel in the development of the 
miseries of poverty and the degradation of vice — who relate, with a Crabbe-like minuteness, the in- 
significant details of every-day life, and require their readers to shed tears of agony over the distresses 
of the lowest and vilest of mankind. Now-a-days, i\\e personnes of a novel are either superhuman 
in their goodness, or ultra-demoniac in their wickedness — it is the age of extremes. 

Paul de Kock, as we have before observed, is a painter of life as it is — his pages teem with ex- 
cellence, but his readers require the possession of a certain wordly experience before they can per- 
ceive the full value of the scenes presented to their notice. Notwithstanding the volatility of the 
class of people from which he selects his sulyects, there is less of oufrance or caricature in his de- 
lineations than in the pages of Marryatt, although, in other points, there is much similarity 
between the two authors. Paul de Kock's works will exist when many of the popular writers of 
the day are forgotten. 

" The Barber of Paris" is the most powerful in its effects of all the author's works. Lively nar- 
rative, startling but natural incident, and great diversity of well-sustained character, combine to 
make the most agreeable reprint of the season. 



The Jubilee of the Cmistitution. A Discourse delivered at the Request of the Neiv Yo7'k Histwica' 
Society, in the City of New York, on Tuesday, the 3Qth of April, 1839 ,• being the Fiftieth Anl 
niversary of the Inauguration of George Washington as President of the United States on 
Thursday, the 30th of April, 1789. By John Quincy Adams. Samuel Caiman, New York. 

This pamphlet should be read by all parties, and then carefully laid aside, as a work abounding in 
valuable minute points of historical information, many of which are not to be met with elsewhere. 
We have here a vigorous sketch of the difficulties which preceded, and of the inefficiency which em- 
barrassed, the confederation originally adopted by the States, and a faithful detail of the causes, 
arising from the imperfection of the first league, which led to the adoption of our present constitu- 
tion. What Mr. Adams has thus done could not be so well done, perhaps, by any man living. The 
circumstances by which he has been surrounded from his boyhood — his intimate connexion, private 
and public, with the leading men of the Revolution — his long continued political career — his in- 
dustrious habits of observation — his personal identification for nearly half a century with the interests 
of his subject — all had conspired to assure us that this subject would be skilfully handled, and the 
discourse itself assures us ihat, essentially, it is. We say essentially — for, considered in a less im- 
portant light, as a matter of mere literature — the whole will be regarded by every one of true taste 
as a failure. This turgid hyper-rhetorical style becomes neither the subject nor the man. Mr. Colman 
has printed the pamphlet most beautifully — as he does every thing of the kind — and no American 
desirous of accurate acquaintance with the political aflairs of his country, will need to be told that it 
is absolutely incumbent upon him to procure a copy, and to prcsei've it. 



The Gentleman of the Old School. By the author of " The Huguenot," " The Robber," etc. 
Two Volumes. Harper and Brothers, New York. 

We have been told, by one who should know, that Mr. James' habits of composition are pecu- 
liar — for example, that, while walking to and fro hurriedly, he dictates, in an excited manner, to 
an amanuensis ; and that it is impossible for the latter, although a practised penman, and chosen 
principally on account of his rapidity of hand, to keep pace with the improvisation of the novelist. 
We hear, moreover, from a different source, that the MSS. thus furiously indited are committed to 
the press, and issued, without farther intervention on the part of the author. The exceeding polish 
of his general style, and, especially, the nice adaptation to each other of the individual portions of 
his works, would, at first sight, seem to throw discredit upon these and similar statements ; but the 
litterateur who writes much will be able readily to perceive how the unchecked fervor of such me- 
thods of composition may do more for niceness of finish, than even a ddigent elaboration in cool 
moments. He will not be able to see, however, (provided he possess any powers of analysis,) how 
such methods can be consistent with weight, depth, true vigor, and, least of all, with originality — 
that apparently most intemperate of literary merits, but the one which, most of all, demarrds a quiet 
self-examination, and a deliberate adjustment of thought. Accordingly, in these points we find Mr. 
James deficient — here speaking, of course, comparatively. He is not as profound nor as original, 
as he is flowing and polished ; but in all good qualities he far surpasses the mass of the novelists of 
the day. 

We do not think the " Gentleman of the Old School" the best, or even the fourth or fifth best, 
of his fictions. We would therefore caution hjm (but then he will never hear us) to pause in his 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 115 

system of amanuensing, and betake himself, in a deliberate spirit, to the ordinaiy proprieties of the 
lamp and the arm-chair. Lady Mallory is inconsistent. We should be wrong in quarrelling- with 

anyjhuman being (much less with the representation of any human being) for inconsistency alone 

but then she is impossibly inconsistent. Her qualities would neutralize each other ; her feelings and 
principles are positively incompatible. Her attempts to interfere with the lovers, Ralph and Edith 
are, in the bitterness of their mahgnancy, altogether at war with that species of goodness which is 
the moralt of her whole nature and existence. We dislike, too, especially, the clap-trap system af- 
fected throughout the book. We despise all such things as rings and miniatures ; and, above all, 
abominate little boxes with mighty secrets hidden therein. The entire merit of the novel is never- 
theless great — but lies among deeper considerations than we could venture to touch upon in any 
cursory and random critique. 



Sketches of London, By the author of " Random Recollections of the Lords and Commons,'" 
" The Great Metropolis," etc. etc. Two Volumes. Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

All the works of Mr. Grant are readable ; but, in general, they have about them an air of book- 
making — an internal evidence, not to be mistaken, of having been written under the inspiration of 
Mammon, instead of a muse. There is always a woful effort at stretching out the mat;ter — at mak- 
ing as much as possible of nothing at all. For this end, the gentleman indulges in an amplitude of 
narration, intermingled with an infinity of comment, which is amusing — to say no more. His style 
is about the flattest imaginable. The tone of his moral or philosophical observation — a point upon 
which he evidently "prides himself — is positively grotesque in its utter platitude. Only imagine long 
chapters of such paternal advice as this ! We should like to see the Uttle queen reading it. 

" I am sure, that were a sovereign, possessed of such amiable feelings as Victoria, and who is so 
exceedingly anxious to promote the cause of morals, and to increase the happiness of mankind — 
only aware of the deploiable and destructive consequences of horse-racing, she would at once with- 
draw her patronage from that pastime." 

" The Sketches of London" resemble the previous books by the same author pretty nearly. All 
have been read — and there can be no very great harm in reading them. They contain a good deal 
of minute information, the accuracy of which has been impugned, and defended, and impugned 
again. To contradict the assertions, in general, of Mr. Grant, requires a kind of knowledge that 
few men possess. There can be no doubt however that he occasionally hazards a bold remark about 
matters of which he is stupidly ignorant. For example — " Oxford street," he says, " is about a 
mile and a half in length in a straight line, being, as already observed, longer than any street in any 
other city in the world." We forget the exact length of Broadway or of Greenwich street, in New 
York — but our own Front street is nearly four miles in length, and we have several others nearly 
as long. 



Popular Lectures on Geology. Treated in a very Comprehensive Manner, by H. C, Von Leon- 
hard, Counsellor of Stale, and Professor at the University of Heildelberg, in Germany. With 
Illustrative Engravings. Translated by Rev. J. G. Morris, A. M., and Edited by Professor 
F. Hall, M. D., etc., etc, N. Hickman, Baltimo7-e. 

These Lectures are, in the proper sense of the word, popular, being at the same time elaborate, 
and sufficiently scientific not to appear jejune. The author. Professor Leonhard, is well known as 
the wiiter of a large and excellent " Manual of Geology and Geognosy," and also of a " Treatise 
on Basaltic Formations, in their relation to Normal and Abnormal Rocks." 

The pamphlet now before us is the first of a series which will be issued in monthly numbers, of 
about one hundied pages each, succeeding each other as fast as they can be done into English, and 
prepared for the press. Many valuable notes are added by the Editor, chiefly on the subject of Ame- 
rican Geology. The engravings, however, are badly done, and derogate very materially from the 
high value of the publication, which we recommend, pointedly, to the notice of our readers. 



The Pocket Lacon; comprising nearly One Thousand Extracts from the Best Authors. Selected 
by John Taylor. Two Volumes. Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

The title here does not fully indicate the nature of the work. The selections are made with no 
reference to beauty of style, or truth of sentiment^ — these points, at all events, being less considered 
than that certain pungency (derived from antithesis, or novelty, or boldness, or paradox,) which acts 
upon thought with the stimulus of spice upon the palate. We do not mean, however, to find fault 



116 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

■with our author upon this account ; but, on the contrary, insist that he has displayed no shallow 
philosophy in his method and matter of extract. Books like this are not to be regarded as vehicles 
of truth, (who, in hei majesty, disdains all insulated arguments, all fragmentary propositions, all 
reasonings in petto,') but merely as provocatives to her pursuit, as the means of an exercise well 
fitted for the strengthening of the powers to be subsequently employed in her attainment. We have 
before us now rather the incentive to logical thought, than its proper or admissible result. Most 
of the opinions advanced in this " Pocket Lacon" are questionable, many of them perversely so- 
phistical, some trashy and unworthy of notice, some even outrageously absurd. In saying this, it 
will be seen that we say nothing against the merit of the book, which is great — or against the ca- 
pacity of the compiler, who has perfectly fulfilled his intention, and who, moreover, in his Preface, 
has given undeniable evidence of sound discrimination and of a cultivated intellect. 



The Triumphs of Science. A Poem. Delivered before the Whig Society of Hanover College. 
By William Wallace, author of the " Battle of Tippecanoe" " Dirge of Napoleon," and other 
Poems. Published at the request of the Society. 

This poem contains about four hundred and fifty pentameter lines. The author, in a dedication 
to Messieurs I. and T. Dowling, Editors of the Wabash Courier, speaks of his production " as the 
last of the kind which he shall ever present to the public ;" but we sincerely hope that he has either 
already thought better of this matter, or will think better of it hereafter. 

In truth, the verses of this unpretending little pamphlet evince powers of a lofty order; we need 
hardly add that, in comparison with three-fourths, or indeed with nine-tenths, of the hot-pressed and 
gilt-edged inanities of the day, they are — Hyperion to a Satyr. We do not wish — it is not our 
fashion — to speak hyperbolically in praise of any thing, but it is no hyperbole to say that there arc 
many passages in " The Triumphs of Science" (so many as to constitute the mass of the poem) 
equal at least to any of the very best specimens of our indigenous poetry. Such versification as 
this, embodying imagery so just, and enkindled by imagination so vigorous, is not a matter of every- 
day occurrence. 

Oh ! who can tell the raptures of that time 
When o'er man's spirit science burst sublime — 
Disclosed the splendors of the spangled dome 
Whose mystic toiches lit Jehovah's home, 
As step by step his soul in wonder trod 
Nature's bright stairway up to Nature's God ? 

Six thousand years the Bell of Time had tolled. 
And still the sea in awful mystery rolled. 
While his blue arms embraced a glorious zone 
No eye had seen save God's great eye alone. 

Passages like these abound in the poem. We need scarcely comment upon their wonderful beauty. 
The image in the third line italicized is of the very highest order of merit of which poetical imagery 
is susceptible — although, elsewhere, we have asserted, and do now still maintain, that imagery, even 
in its purest nature and most skilful adaptation, belongs to a secondary rank, only, of poetical ex- 
cellence. But upon this topic we may take occasion to speak more fully hereafter. In regard to 
the line above, commencing " Six thousand years," we repeat that it is perfect in its way, and gives 
evidence of an original mind imbued with a deeply imaginative sentiment. An every-day poetaster 
would here have affronted and overpowered us by some classical balderdash about scythes and hour- 
glasses, (to say nothing of grey -beards and fore-locks and wings upon the feet,) and would never 
have dared to dream that there existed so modern and so common-place a thing in the world as the 
spirit-lifting and memory-stirring bell. 

Still, we should be sorry to estimate the powers of Mr. Wallace by what we see here, and are in- 
clined to regard this pamphlet rather as an indication, than as the result, of his ability. The sim- 
ple idea of a task fulfilled, of a poem (especially) upon a stated subject, delivered at an appointed 
hour, before an expectant society, carries with it visions of embarrassment and constraint, repugnant 
to the best feelings of true merit, and in consonance with the feeble sleepy notions of mediocrity 
alone. Therefore, Mr. W. has not now written as he could and would have written under more 
favorable circumstances. But we acknowledge the evidence of far more than ordinary strength in 
his efforts — or, more strictly, in the character of his efforts — to break through the conventional tram- 
mels of this despicable species of task-writing — a species in which no man of true taste will wish 
to succeed — in which no man of high genius can — a species, in short, whose sine qua non of suc- 
cess depends upon the negative, and certainly somewhat anomalous merit, of the possession of no

talent at all. A reasonable individual would as soon think of flying in fetters, or of going up sero- 
nauting in a leaden balloon. 



Tortesa, the Usurer. A Play. By N. P. Willis. Samuel Colman, Neio Yorh. 

" Tortesa" is, we think, by far the best play from the pen of an American author. Its merits He 
among the higher and most diflicult dramatic qualities, and, although few in number, are extensive 
in their influence upon the whole work ; pervading it, and fully redeeming it from the sin of its 
multitudinous minor defects. These merits are naturalness, truthfulness, and appropriateness, upon 
all occasions, of sentiment and language; a manly vigor and breadth in the conception of charac- 
ter; and a fine ideal elevation or exaggeration thioughout — a matter forgotten or avoided by those 
who, with true Flemish perception of truth, wish to copy her peculiarities in disarray. Mr. Willis 
has not lost ^ght of the important consideration that the perfection of dramatic, as well as of plas- 
tic skill, is found not in the imitation of Nature, but in the artistical adjustment and amplification 
of her features. We recognize a refined taste upon every page of " Tortesa." Its points, too, are 
abundant, and scatter vivacity and brilliancy over the play. That the excellences of which we 
speak are great, cannot be more forcibly shown than by allusion to some of the innumerable faults 
which aie still insufficient to render these excellences obscure. 

The plot is miserably incoiisequential, A simple prose digest, or compendium, of the narrative, 
would be scarcely intelligible, so much is the whole overloaded with incidents that have no bearing 
upon the ultimate result. Three-fourths of the play might be blotted out without injury to the plot 
properly so called. This would be less objectionable, if it were not that the attention of the reader 
is repeatedly challenged to these irrelevant incidents, as if they were actually pertinent to the main 
business of the drama. We are not allowed to pass them by, in perusal, as obviously episodical. 
We fatigue ourselves with an attempt to identify them with the leading interests, and grow at length 
wearied in the fruitless effort. When we perceive Zippa plotting and counterplotting upon every 
page, it is impossible not to think that she is plotting to some purpose. She does nothing, however, 
in the end; and for any effect upon the play, might as well never have existed. An instance of 
this is seen in the last act, where the whole of the second scene is introduced for the purpose of in- 
forming her, by means of Tomaso, of the danger of Angelo. She rushes from the stage exclaim- 
ing that she has it in her power to save his life ; and of course, in the trial scene, we naturally expect 
some important interference on her part. The judgment is rendered, however, without her interpo- 
sition. The conclusion of the play, too, is much in the same way. The audience cannot be brought 
to believe that all the scheming and counterscheming here introduced is in the slightest degree es- 
sential, since the entire difficulty might have been settled by a single word from the Duke, who is 
favorably disposed to all parties. 

The old manoeuvre of the sleeping draught calls Romeo and Juliet somewhat too forcibly to mind. 
The idea, too, of the deception practised upon Tortesa by means of the portrait is borrowed appa- 
rently from the Winter's Tale, and is moreover absurd. No person could have been thus deceived, 
and the spectator cannot imagine any such deception. " The back wall of the scene," we are told 
in the stage directions, " is so arranged as to form a natural ground for the picture ;" but this is ob- 
viously impossible, except in regard to a single point of view — the illusion would be dispelled by 
the slightest movement on the part of Tortesa. There are a great many other improbabilities which 
entirely destroy the vraisemblance — but we have not space to point them out. The characters, ge- 
nerally, are deficient in prominence — in individuality. Zippa is a positive failure — we can make 
nothing of her. Tortesa is outrageously inconsistent. It is impossible to reconcile the utter black- 
guard of the first scenes, with the lofty self-sacrificing spirit vcho figures in the last. The concep- 
tion, too, of the revulsion of feeling on the part of the usurer is a very antique conception at best. 
But we repeat that, in spite of these and a hundred other serious blemishes, we esteem " Tortesa" 
as by far the best American play. Mr. Willis, we are happy to perceive, has nearly altogether 
thrown aside the besetting sin of his earlier days — the sin of affectation. This was his worst ene- 
my — vanquishing it, he has nothing to fear. Mr. Colman cannot be too highly praised for the 
beauty of this publication, which forms a volume of his " Dramatic Library." 



Precaution. A Novel. By tJie Author of the '^ Spy T '■'■ Pioneer ^ etc., etc. A New Edition, Re- 
vised by the Author. Two Volumes. Lea a?id Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

This, the first of Mr. Cooper's novels in point of time, is beyond all question the last in point of 
quality — yet it may be read wilh pleasure, and will and should be read by all our literary people, as 
a matter of simple curiosity, and in view of what the author of the " Spy" has since so happily ac- 
complished. He tells us, in the preface to the present edition, that the book originally owed ita 



118 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

existence to an accident, and was printed under circumstances which prevented his own personal 
supervision of the press. The consequences were many defects in plot, style, and arrangement. The 
publication, too, was nearly, if not totally ruined, by mere typographical errors — the fruits of a bad 
MS. Under these circumstances the public must acknowledge their indebtedness to Messieurs Lea 
and Blanchard for the present edition. We cannot forbear saying, however, that had we been Mr. 
Cooper — had we been Alexander instead of Diogenes — we should not have again thrust the book 
upon the attention of the public, but, putting it quietly behind the fire, have endeavored, with all our 
might and main, to forget that so great a mass of trash ever existed. 



Six Weeks in Fauquier. Being the substance of a series of Familiar Letters, illustrating the 
Scenery, Localities, Medicinal Virtues, and General Characteristics of the White Sulphur 
Springs, at Warrenton, Fauquier County, Virginia. Written in 1838, to a Gentleman in 
Netv England. By a Visiter. Samuel Colman, New York. -^ 

This is a long title to a rather small affair — a thin duodecimo of sixty-seven pages. The truth 
is that the whole ivork has very much the air of a quack advertisement; and, but for those incon- 
trovertible words, " By a Visiter," one might suspect that the proprietors of the While Sulphur 
Springs had themselves turned authors for the r .5. Be this as it may, the writer should not be 
accused of a lack of zeal for these waters. Indee .0 sometimes carries it to the verge'of a blunder. — 
In the preface, for instance, he first abuses Sar ga on account of that facility of access which ren- 
ders its company " promiscuous," and proceeds then to expatiate in praise of the " immense crowds 
which have liitherto resorted to the White Sulphur." Amid a collection of recommendatory let- 
ters, also, there occurs one from B. Watkins Leigh, in which the Senator somewhat equivocally as- 
serts that the dropsical symptoms with which he went to Fauquier have been continually declining 
" ever since he got home." There can be no doubt, however, that the springs in question have high 
medicinal, and higher fashionable virtues. The scenery is beautiful, the charges are moderate, the 
accommodations good. In fact every thing concerning them is good — with the exception of this 
stupid little book — which is very bad indeed — very. 



The White Sulphur Papers, or Life at the Spriiigs of Western Virginia. By Mark Pencil, Esq. 

Samuel Colman, New York. 

A larger, a handsomer, and altogether a better volume on the same subject, although abound- 
ing, we are sorry to say, in typographical errors. This is the more to be regretted, as the mechani- 
cal execution, otherwise, is of a very superior order. 

" The White Sulphur Papers" are written v.'ith sprightliness, and have much general interest. 
To persons contemplating a visit to the Springs such a book as this is invaluable. It affords, in an 
agreeable manner, all necessary information, besides being full of anecdote and chit-chat. Moreove 
we can aver, upon the authority of our friends of the " Corsair," that Mark Pencil, Esq. is tict 
Proprietor of the Springs, and that he is a gentlemanly personage. We presume, too, that he I 
no private interests to serve in the publication — which, at all events, is very readable, and very cre- 
ditable to both author and publisher. 



A Defence of Female Education. Read before the Columbus Lyceum, by John Southerldnd 
Lewis. Columbus, Georgia. Published by order of the Society. 

This essay does Mr. Lewis some credit. The necessity for any " Defence of Female Education" 
is, to be sure, not very apparent — but he has handled his subject with great ability, and placed that 
which was before clear in a perfectly brilliant light.

AND 



AMERICAN MONTHLY REVIEW. 



SEPTEMBEU, 1839. 

B I GR APHY F 

RICHARD PENN SMITH. 

Few of the liteiary men of this country can look back to so large an amount of ancestral talent as 
the subject of this memoii. His grandfather, the Rev. Dr. Smith, who had received a highly finished 
European education, was the first Provost of Philadelphia College, in the University of Pennsylvania, 
which station he filled with distinguished honor to himself and success to the institution for a period 
of twenty -five years. He was a man of rare natural endowments, and these he had carefully and as- 
siduously cultivated, so that he stood foremost among the most eminent persons of his time, as a close 
student, a profound and varied scholar, an acute a]rd vigorous thinker, an accurate observer, and 
a writer of great beauty and energy, who attracted attention by his felicitous style, and secured ad- 
miration by his manly and high-toned sentiments, no less than by his abundant, apposite, but never 
ostentatious knowledge. As a preacher, he possessed a bold, and commanding, mingled with a sub- 
duing power of eloquence, which sometimes led him to break forth in strains of the most startling 
admonition and reproof ; and at others to melt thefeelingsof his audience by displays of the tenderest 
sympathy and affection. All contemporary critics bestowed upon him high praise for his pulpit exercises, 
and more than one of the British reviewers compared him to Massillon and Bossuet, to each of whom 
in certain things he was said to'bear a very striking resemblance. He was also much addicted to scien- 
tific labors, and in the study of astronomy, which he pursued with great ardor, he was instrumental 
in bringing to light the abilities of the then unknown Rittenhouse, and his friendly advice and as- 
sistance were always fully appreciated by that self-taught philosopher. He had, moreover, a very ex- 
quisite taste in the fine arts, and was one of the first to perceive, and the warmest to encourage, the 
dawning genius of Benjamin West, whose early efforts, rude and misshapen as they seemed, satisfied 
the quick eye of the connoisseur that he was destined to fill no ordinary place among painters re- 
nowned for ability. Some of the first productions of the future President of the Academy were made 
at the instance of this patron, and they still hang upon the walls of his former library, which they 
serve to render curious if they do not adorn. Nor with all his variety of learning and elegance of 
taste, did he neglect things that were of more immediate utility. His active mind was strongly di- 
rected to the Internal Improvement of the State, and in a treatise which he published on the subject 
more than fifty years ago, he designated several of the lines of communication which have since then 
been adopted. Altogether he was a remarkable man ; sagacious as well as learned ; at once brilliant 
and profound ; one who mingled with a fervid imagination, a severe discipline of judgment, and en- 
gaged with equal earnestness in the pursuit of abstract literature, or works of practical value. His 
writings, which have been collected into several volumes, have passed thi-ough various editions, with 
the most marked approbation. 

Dr. Smith left several sons, the eldest of whom Wm. Moore Smith was the father of our piesenf 
subject. As might have been expected, this gentleman enjoyed all the advantages of the most liberal 
roi,, T. — NO. III. E 3

«ducation which this country could then furnish. Nor were these advantages misplaced in him. In' 
Meriting from his father a 1 've of study, and gifted with a quick capacity, he early distinguished him 
self as a scholar; and as he joined to his ardor in graver acquirements a keen relish for the lighter 
branches of literature, his mind was equally stored with the profound and elegant productions of the 
classics. Early in life he published a volume of poems, which were characterized by much brilliancy 
of fancy, ease of versification, justness of sentiment, and chaste and nervous diction. They were 
re-printed in England, and made the subject of much commendation, a fact at that time of such un- 
frequent occurrence, that it deserves to be remembered. Having enlarged his views and replenished 
his judgment with extensive foreign travel, Mr. Smith came to the bar of this city, and soon rose to 
deserved eminence. The dry details of legal science, and the slavish attendance during term-time 
on the courts, were, however, uncongenial to his feelings, and he retired to cultivate his favorite 
studies amid the thick umbrageousness that surrounded his family mansion on the Schuylkill. Here 
in daily intercourse with the poets and sages of antiquity, and continual observation of the choicest- 
beauties of nature, he passed his life in grateful enjoyment, and here he has left behind him the en- 
during monument of an unsullied reputation. 

KiCHAUD Penn Sjiith is a native of Philadelphia, where he has generally resided. When a boy 
lie was remarkable among his school-fellows for great quickness of perception, which being united to 
a memory of singular retentiveness, gave him peculiar facilities in acquiring the different branches of 
tnowledge to which his attention was directed. In the mathematics he was especially distinguished 
by the ease, rapidity, and accuracy with which he mastered the most complicated and perplexing de- 
tails of the science ; and, as we have been informed by more than one of his class-mates, such were- 
his extraordinary powers of calculation that many of his demonstrations, in this respect, were matters 
of absolute astonishment. In other studies he was also forward; and while he was thus preparing 
for a future ripeness of scholarship, he was at the same time drinking deeply from the various foun- 
tains of belles-lettres literature, which were furnished to him in his well-stored paternal library. His 
love of writing manifested itself while he was yet quite young, and a scries of essays contributed by 
him to the " Union," under the title of the " Plagiary," show very considerable ability of design and 
very correct taste in composition. About the close of the year 1 822, he purchased the Aurora, a well 
known newspaper establishment, of which Mr. Duane had previously to that time been the editor. Like 
many others who have embarked in similar enterprizes, Mr. Smith found this a most unprofitable 
speculation, and after five years of toil and vexation, he abandoned it, though not before it had swal- 
lowed up a considerable portion of his patrimony. During the period of his connexion with this 
paper, notwithstanding he conducted it with zeal and industry, he made numerous contributions to 
the periodical literature of the day, besides producing several dramatic pieces, some of which were not 
only cordially received at the lime of their first representation, but still continue to maintain their 
■places on the stage. i 

Mr. Smith is one of the best dramatic scholars — so to speak — that it has been our good fortune to 
meet with. In this department of literature he has studied with all the masters, both of ancient and 
modern times, and his mind is richly laden with the fruits of his application. With the old English 
dramatists he is especially famihar. He knows them all as he does his nearest and most intimate 
friends. In their native, though sometimes unpolished strength — their clearness of thought — their 
charming simplicity of expression — their healthy tone of sentiment — their undiluted force of dic- 
tion — his conect taste early found abundant means of gratification ; and undeterred by the rubbish 
beneath which many of their beauties lie concealed, he spared no pains until he possessed himself 
fully of their treasures. With such a keenness of relish for this species of literature — with so ample 
a knowledge both of the rules of the art and the works of the artists — with strong powers of obser- 
vation, varied acquirements, a lively imagination, and successful practice in poetical composition, it 
was natural that Mr. S. should have attempted to emulate what he so much admired, and accordingly 
we find that he has written two dramas avowedly prepared after the old English models. These 
plays " The Disowned, or the Prodigal," and " The Deformed, or Woman's Trial," both exhibit much 
skill in construction, considerable invention, and accurate delineation of character ; and they are still 
more distinguished by a just and elevated torre of sentiment, and a cojiious flow of sterling language 
obviously drawn from the " pure v/cll of English undefiled." Both these pieces have been performed 
■with decided marks of success ; and the last named, " The Deformed," received last winter the most 
unequivocal approbation from as intelligent an audience as was ever assembled within the walls of 
Chestnut street Theatre. " The Disowned" and " The Deformed" r.'ere also performed at the Lon- 
don theatres, where they made a favorable impression. Besides these dr-amas, Mr. S. has written a 
tragedy, and numerous petite comedies, and farces. The Tragedy, Cuius Marius, was composed for, 
and at the request of Mr. E. Forrest, for whom the principal character was specially designed. Caius 
Marius was originally brought out at the Arch street Theatre, where it had a run of several nights, 
but such was the weakness of the then company, that it was grossly marred in the peifoimance, and 
Mr. S. withdrew it in disgust from the stage. It has great capabilities for an acting play, abounds in 
■vigorous declamation, and contains many passages of strong and beautiful poetry. We hope shortly 
to see it revived under better auspices, and we confidently predict its success. 

Many years ago Mr. S. published a novel in two volumes, which he called The Forsaken. At that

time the surpassing gloric? of I\Ir. Cooper had comp'etoly ccliised all other American novelists. Few 
indeed, then ventured to enter upon the path which he had made so completely his own, and fewer 
still could successfully hear up against the overpoweiing weight of his reputation. One or two only, 
and they mo-cd in a dirt'e.-ent sphere, occupied any favorable place in the public regard. Simms, and 
Biid, and numeious others who have since successfully entered the lists against the " Author of the 
Spy" had not tlicn appeared, and all eyes v.eie turned to him as undisputed master of the field. 
Under such discouraging circumstances it is a proof of much meiit in Th.e Forsaken that a large edi- 
tion of it was speedily exhausted. It possesses, in fact, far higher claims to favor than many similar 
publications whicii have since enjoyed more envial)!e popularity. The plot is natural and developed 
without any violence to probability ; the incidents which arc chiefly historical, are skilfully introduced 
and interblended with the progress of the narrative ; the characters are vigorously drawn, and forci- 
bly contrasted ; the descriptions are truthful, and the dialogue well sustained and discriminated. The 
prevailing fault of the book is carelessness of manner, and an inattention to the minor details ; but it 
is strongly maiked with all the characteristics of an original and vigorous intellect. 

In 1836, Mr. S. published two volumes of miscellaneous productions, under the title of " The 
Actress of Padua, and other Tales," which had an extensive sale, and were much commended. In 
tale-writing Mr. S. has few superiors. He selects his subjects with great care, avoiding always such 
as are tiite, but never seeking for novelty in the regions of mysticism or tenor. The narrative por- 
tions of his stories are always simple and unexaggerated ; the persons he introduces are plain, every- 
day, real flesh and blood people, without much pretension or display, but full of homely sense and 
practical w^isdom ; and he alwaj's places them in such situations as to draw from their conduct a 
sound and valuable moral. The style of these lighter productions is remarkably chaste ; neither en- 
cumbered by needless ornament, nor rendered harsh by ill-timed affectation of conciseness, but easy 
without negligence and flowing without diffuseness. 

In the same year that Mr. S. gave to the press the volumes just refened to, he produced^i work 
which has been the subject of much grave speculation. We allude to " Colonel Crockett's Tour in 
Texas," a pseudo-autobiography, or memoir, which purported to have been written by the gallant 
Tennessean, prior to the fatal field of the Alamo. This work which vYas published anonymously, 
and of course, without any view to reputation, was prepared in great haste, b-ut it contains never- 
theless much that is worthy of admiration. As an evidt-nce of Mr. Smith's facility in composition 
it may be mentioned that on the day succeeding that on whicii the idea was first suggested by the 
booksellers, for whom it was written, a portion of this volume was actually in press, and the remainder 
was supphed from time to time," so as to keep even pace with the stereotype founder. Few books 
have gained equal popularity'. In the course of a single year upwards of ten thousand copies were 
sold in the United States, and the demand for it still continues atrtive. Soon after its appearance 
here, it was re-piinted in London, where it was reviewed by the principal cri Jyal journals in terms 
of the most flattering approval. Frazer's Magazine commends it for its quaint humor and graphic 
description; the London Monthly Eeview compares it to Goldsmith for pathos, and to Swift for 
satire; and Chambcis' Edinburgh Journal, completely deceived by its air of sincerity, quotes from it 
as the best account of the then exist'"g state of affairs in Texas. Indeed, although Mr. S. never visit- 
ed our sister republic, it is not unlikely that liis descriptions of her agricultural demesne, and his 
strictures on her civil polity, m^y be to the full as true as most of the accounts of " travelled history" 
which in this book-making ago are so abundant. " Crockett's Tour" abounds in lively sallies of hu- 
mor, intermingled with much acutcness of observation and keen and caustic satire. 

In addition to the works specifically mentioned, Mr. S. has written voluminously for numerous 
periodicals. His poetry, if collected, would make a book of respectable dimensions, and much of it 
would be found superior to the average quality of that commodity. As most of his smaller pieces 
were written on occasional subjects, and aic scattered over vaiious publications, they are not likely 
to be reclaimed. It is by his dramatic efforts, therefore, that his merits as a poet must be determined, 
and judged by these he will be assigned a place in the foremost rank of American writers. 

In person Mr. ymith is about the middle height, of a spare but vigorous frame. His face is a re- 
markably fine one. The features are all regular, symmctiica', and well formed, and the expression 
is eminently intellectual. The accompanying engraving, which is made from an admirable likeness, 
by Williams — a young artist of great promise in this city — in consequence of the heavy masses of 
shadow, represents him as older and sterner looking tlian lie is in reality ; but otherwise conveys a 
very just idea of his appearance. In his social relations no man is more esteemed. Of a frank, ge- 
nerous, and benevolent nature, he attracts and secures the fiienuship of all who know him ; while his 
ready and never-failing wit, and his varied and abundant stores of information, make him a delightful 
and instructive companion. 

Mr. Smith read law with the late WiUiara Eaule, one of cur most distinguished jurists, and was 
admitted to the bar after the usual course of studies. For several years past he has applied himseL 
diligently to the practice of his profession, to the neglect of weekly literary pr.rsuits, though we have 
recently been told that he lias an liistorical work in preparation. In addition to his engagements as 
as a lawyer Mr. S. holds the situation of Secretary to the Comptrollers of Public Schools, a situation 
that yields hira a handsome income. 



THE PRIVATEEU. 



A TALE OF THE LATE AMERICAN WAR, 



[Continued from page 75.] 



CHAPTER ly. 

SCENES AT SEA. 

It was daybreak on the sea, and a solitary yawl with two men was drifting many leagues from 
land, away to the eastward of Cape St. Roque. The dawn was beautifully serene. The wind yet 
slept on the broad, smooth vestiges of a recent storm, and far around as eye could trace, not a flaw 
of the waking gale skimmed the wearied swells. Here was flung a gay green mantle of undulating 
sea-weed ; there the quick ripple of a shoal of silver minnows dimpled the waving sheet, and some- 
times a sudden billow and a splash would call the eye away to catch the glistening fin of a shark, 
sinking in a whirl. Softly glancing up the eastern sky were the first rosy pencillings of Aurora's 
fingers. In another moment the splendid light of these climes was shooting rocket-like across the 
gorgeous dome, and waving on its spangled floor. The sea was an immense coverlid, fresh and 
dazzling from nature's loom. Its softer tints and bolder brilliancy ever changing and dancing with 
the sweeping roll of the swells, cheated the biiffled eye into the illusion of enchantment. The most 
exquisite paintmg could not have reached the brightness of even its shadows. As if the superb scene 
■were lighted for the coming of a wizzard, the sun burst vividly on the stage, and a train of gorgeous 
clouds floated in his sparkling wake like a noble fleet under convoy. 

And now, quicker and keener, the mariners swept anxious looks around; rising hurriedly on the 
seats without daring to look at each other, they searched the red horizon again, more slowly, more 
closely, with trembling hands shading their eyes. He in the stern of the yawl was a young man 
of elegant form and high-bred features, yet he was pale and ghastly, and his coal-black whiskers and 
soft moustache were shapeless, and blended with a later growth of beard. He had neither hat nor 
cap, and his profuse, neglected hair, was matted with a swollen gash, that glanced from the top of 
his head to the temple. A black silk handkerchief was thrown around his handsome throat in a 
careless sailor's knot. He wore a soiled blue jacket of elegant cut, and a pair of full white trowsers 
were belted to his waist, falling loosely around his limbs, and barely preserving the wasted outline 
of their naturally muscular symmetry. There was a wild, and at that moment, a somewhat fiendish 
glare in his quick black ey e, which seemed to read the soul of others by its own light, as the hunter's 
torch, when it catches the gaze of the quailing stag. The other was a negro of powerful frame, and 
a clever, boyish countenance ; with the exception of a worn French naval cap, he was dressed as a 
sailor in the merchant service, and the usual jack-knife swung by a lanyard from his button hole. 
There were two oars in the boat, and the dew stood thick on their blades and handles, as if they had 
not been used for some hours. No sail, arms, compass, or provisions were to be seen. 

Long and intensely they scanned the ocean. Sometimes a far-off porpoise would fling a volume of 
;foam into the air, or a white sea-bird ride across a distant swell, and then their hearts beat loud and 
-their breath came quick, but alas, its echo was a groan. Nothing — not a speck they saw, till, tracing 
the spotless circle around, their eyes met and read despair. The young man threw himself with an 
impatient curse upon the seat, and the negro ventured a word of hope. 

"Nebber give up, Mas Walter," for it was Walter De Berrian to whom he spoke, "hab verry 
^ood luck dis fur — got away from de cursed willians, and weathered a heavy squall last night, — ain't 
all for nothin — please gor Amighty." 

" No, for the sake of blood," gnashed De Berrian, with a start. " I would Uve for nothing else, — 
my only friend is a friendless negro. Relatives ! — the word chokes me ! — and I, a gentleman by 
birth and rearing, am here, a starving outcast, trampled and damned by the very canaille of hell ! 
Ha ! I would barter eternity for a sabre and foothold on the Tiger's deck." 

The kind-hearted negro was troubled at the fierce words and look of his young companion ; and 
tears coursed over his dusky cheeks, when De Berrian glanced hatefully on even him. The dread- 
ful thought of his insanity was agonizing to the faithful black ; he feared and wept to think that 



THE PRIVATEER. 123 

fever from his wound and thirst might have turned his beloved jjoung master's hrain. De Berrian 
threw himself half over the stern, and plunged his hot hands deep into the sea. He splashed the 
water over his aching head, and it trickled back with the same cool murmur as the fresia waterfall. 
What was the doom of Tantalus to the mockery of death from thirst on an ocean? 

A sudden thought illumined the eye of the delighted negro. Tearing the woollen lining from his 
jacket he carefully wiped up the heavy dew from the oars and the seats, and applied the swab to De 
Beriian's mouth. 

" Suck 'um, Mas Walter, suck 'um dry, when dats gone, here's de knife, and here's my finger, — 
Peter must die first." 

" Never, my devoted fiiend," answered the youth, wringing the swab in the sea, " we will die 
together." 

The negro turned away to hide his tears. Bathing his wound, which was bleeding afresh, De 
Berrian saw a slender braid of Catharine Harman's hair upon his wrist; it encircled the chafed and 
inflamed mark of a handcuff. Many years ago the rosy girl had woven it there, and laughingly 
called him her slave. "Am I such a slave even yet?" he thought, as he dashed aside a tear. " Oh if she 
could see me now, would she not regret 1" Vividly did that delicious hour rise up before him when 
his cousin's fairy fingers were weaving that frail ringlet upon his arm. It was a morning, the fairest 
of fair summer's daughters, when the imperious little queen and her train of fawns and parrots were 
handed into a painted barge, and rowed far out on the tranquil bay, by her brother and cousin. When 
they landed again, her delighted majesty wove for each a braid of her glossy curls and, with bended 
knee, and kiss of her hand, they were dubbed " Knights of the Raven Tress." The spell of memory's 
dream was upon the youth, and dropping his head upon the hard gun-wale he fell asleep with one 
hand trailing in the sea. The negro carefully folded the lining of his jacket over De Berrian's wound, 
to protect it from the sun, and resumed an anxious watch. 

An hour after, he espied a branch of some tropical tree floating near, and reaching It with an oar, 
he found it bore a few redish berries ; perhaps some careless hand had thrown it into the sea, for it 
had many tiny stems from which the fruit had been apparently plucked. The noise awoke the 
uneasy sleeper, and hastily gathering the greater part of the berries in his cap, the negro presented it 
joyfully to Walter. 

" Nay, nay, good Peter, we shall divide them equally." 
" No, massa, — don't lub 'um — dese enough for me." 

Walter ravenously ate the acid fruit, and picking the last from the cap, he started to see beneath 
the blackened stamp of the manufacturer, the name of'' Charles Harman, schooner La belle lantheP 
"Peter, where did you get this capl" breathlessly asked De Berrian. 

" Britishman took mj' bran new tarpaulin, and gib me dat, him said it 'longed to one of de pri- 
soners — only fit for dam nigger." 

" It cannot — it must be !" — wildly spoke the youth, as he bounded to his feet. "Peter! for 
heaven's sake tell" — but the negro was dumb and still, for his eagle eye had caught a sail ! Away 
to the south a broad blue belt, the track of a glorious breeze, was careering towards them, and the 
seamen felt that the feeble point at its farthest edge on which the sunlight trembled must be a sail. 
Motionless as the cascade frozen in its leap, he stood for one straining, intense moment. The 
mere speck fluttered like a ray in the dew-drop shaken by the wind of morning. It vanished, it 
glittered again ; and De BerTian started from his trance at the wild and prolonged shout of " a sail ! a 
sail !" 

O, what a tide of vivid thoughts comes bounding over the soul of the shipwrecked at that exulting 
cry ! The clasped hands, the bended knees, and the fast and eloquent prayers from tongues that 
never prayed before ! The world — that libelled yet delightful world, to which stern hearts had 
bidden eternal adieu, starts up again in its joy and splendor. Wealth, fame, and heaven, dance in 
brilliant fancy's train ; or else some sweet cottage steals upon the sight, and the sailor sees his wife and 
babes. And how quick and dark is the reaction ! Like death in a festive hall, at the next moment 
all is dread and pallor. The distant sail may glide along the ocean's edge, and disappear ; and who 
can tell the misery of such a fear ] The chilling awe that hushes the breathing of a child when a 
beautiful scene of clouds and fairies is suddenly shifted, he knows not how, for the den and incan- 
tations of a demon, is not half so withering as that dreadful doubt. 

With such hopes and fears, flashing and darkening as lightning at midnight, De Berrian and 
Peter hoisted a handkerchief on an oar. They spoke not a word, and their ej'es never for a moment 
left that far low sail. For hours it seemed as still as the floating foam at dawn, but slowly at last 
it lifted higher from the haze of many leagues, and the slender hull became a dark point under the 
silvery bubble of canvas. They strained their eyes again — and yes — hurrah ; her course lay towards 
them. In a delirium of joy the negro caught De Berrian in his brawny arms, and then tears fell 
fast together. She came skimming along hke a sea-bird, and Peter at the next look stamped a furious 
jig that almost capsized the boat, for he saw the stars and stripes poised like a butterfly on the bosom 
of the gale. In a half hour a beautiful armed brig dashed alongside, and Walter and his shouting 
companion clambered over the gang-vc ay of the American Privateer, Sea-Gull. 

W' alter was known and recognized by one of the officers, and his singular story was listened to 



124 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

with much interest. " We belonged," said he, " to the ship Atalanta, of Baltimore. On her return 
voyage from the South seas, a week since, we were crossing the line, when a strange sail which 
seemed to be following us, was reported to windward. Near dusk we made her out, a large top-sail 
schooner, low and black in the water, with long booms and gieat rake of mast. She bore suddenly 
down athwart our course. Suspecting her to be a cruiser, the captain put on all sail, and bore two 
points away. At dawn, however, the schooner overhauled us, showed British colors, and threw a 
shot across our bows. The captain defied them ; the ciew cheered ; they gave us a broadside, and 
boarded. A sanguinary fight ensued, bat they poured upon us in swarms, and we were overpowerd. 
Enraged at our defence, and the loss of some of their best men, they threw us into irons, and treated 
us W'ilh the utmost barbarity, I received this slash across my head from a copper-gilled Spaniard of 
a lieutenant, who was for making us all walk the plank. He was a very devil, and eternally growl- 
ing for our blood. The schooner ^vas the British Privateer, Tiger, commanded by a villain who had 
been dismissed from the Royal navy. She was fitted out from the West Indies." 

" But how did you escape V 

" This man," resumed De Berrian, looking gratefully at Peter, " was cook of the Atalanta. When 
she was taken, he pretended to be mad with joy at his deliverance from slavery, though he is free. 
The British were taken in, and so was Peter, for they shipped him at once, and messed him with the 
prize guard. Peter had conceived a lasting friendship for me; I saw him as often as caution justified, 
and he swore to assist us all at the first opportunity. My friend the Spaniard, Juan De Alva, was 
prize-master of the Atalanta, though the Tiger still kept companj'. My w'ound, which had never 
been dressed, became excessively painful, and at times I was delirious. At the intercession of a 
humane officer my irons were taken off, and I was allowed for an hour or so to come on deck. The 
cursed Spaniard took these occasions to treat me with the basest indignity. He never forgave me for 
a gash I ga^e him in the bloody fray of our capture, which spoiled his prided moustache forever. 
Often I would have snatched a pike and pinned him to the deck, but a moment's thought, or a look 
from Peter, restrained me. 

" Two niglits ago we were close in shore. The night was dark, and a light land breeze was 
springing up. I had been on deck some time, watching several lights scarcely discernible on the 
coast. Tire watch were half asleep, and Juan was below drunk and ill-humored. Peter came to me 
carelessly whistling; as he passed he whispered in my ear to go over the side and clamber aft, if I 
Avould escape with him; he said we cordd get off in the yawl and reach shore before morning, as he 
knew the coast perfectly well. Trembling with hope, I did as he directed, unobserved by a single 
soul. I had reached the bow of the yawl, when I heard a short cough, as of one being choked — it 
was the man at the wheel, whom Peter had gagged and bound. He quickly lashed the wheel, and 
lowered the 3'awl, without noise, till the keel almost touched the water, and then belayed. 

" ' On deck there !' halloed the gruff Spaniard. 

" ' Aye !aye I' answered Peter, in a feigned voice. 

" I thought we were gone. It was a terrible moment. The next thing was a startled 'Jesu Maria,' 
from the companion way — then a stunning blow, and the grating of the hatch as it was fastened 
down. Peter threw himself over the taffrail, and we swung ourselves into the yawl. Hooking his 
feet under the stern sheets he caught the tackle alone and lifted the stern so that I could cast loose. 
With a powerful effort of strength he held on and I cut away the forward fall, till but a few strands 
supported us. ' Let fall,' I whispered, as I severed them at a stroke, and instantly with a splash 
that nearly' capsized us, we found ourselves a hundred yards from the ship. 

"In less than a quarter of an hour, we heard a shout from the Atalanta. I.ights'wcre run up, and 
answered instantly from the Tiger, that was sailing on her lee. Presently we distinguished shouts 
from several boats rowing swiftly in different directions, they seemed at length to converge to a point — 
that point was ourselves. They separated =»gain, and we rowed like Turks, for the chances were in 
our favor. We listened for a moment — but one boat was in hearing, and the long sweep of her oars 
was plainly distinct, for she was coming right upon us. I now thought the game was up, but Peter 
C00I3' drevf in the oars, and lashed them fore and aft, on the seats. Directing me to look out, he 
dipped the gunwale under a wave, and the yawl filled. We held on with our heads just out of the 
water. The short and active clang of the pursuing boat grew fearfully near. She passed within 
pistol shot ; and the men rested on their oars to listen ; by the gleam of a dark lantern which he fr(S- 
quently flashed across the water, I •ruw the fiendish countenance of Juan De Alva. The Spaniard 
yelled a bloody oath, which was chorused by all hands — the boat shot off in another direction — and 
we saw them no more. Peter, chuckling to himself, bailed out the yawl with his cap, and we pulled 
again for the shore. The wind, however, freshened, and we were obliged to stand before it. By 
day neither ship nor shore was to be seen. I,ast night we encountered a heavy gale, and expected 
every moment to be lost. Thank heaven, we are here." 

" The Tiger — from the West Indies'!" — half-mused Captain Parole. 

" Yes," answered De Berrian, "but this deserter can give 5'ou more information than I." 

" Dat him dam name," said Peter, " him tuck many vessels — hab plenty cash, massa — 'sprized"; 
one French schooner last thing "fore us — hab ossifers in 'um hold now — treats 'um wery bad." 

" And what is his force, you black traitor 1" 



THE PRIVATEER. 125 

" Him totes 'leven guns, and a hundred and large odd men. Call me traitor, massa 1 Traitor like 
to go back again wid present company — ha — ha." 

" Well, ray fine sea minck," laughed the captain, •' we will solicit an interview, and restore you to 
your honor, and your flag." 



CHAPTER V. 

THE INTERVIEW. 

Sa:muel Paholk, the hold commander of the Sea-Gull, was a tawny fine looking man, with a 
fierce moustache, short black tuft, and a dare-devil eye. That eye swept the blue ocean at a glance, 
and, disappointed, hid its impatience in a fiown ; but when it caught the coming sail its gleam of 
joy was dark and stealthy as the ciouching search of the tigress. His frame was built with the man- 
liness of a statue, and the bounding activity of an Arab steed. Captain Parole was a daring tacti- 
tician, a stern commander ; and a better swordsman never crimsoned steel. Beloved, or rather 
adored, by officers and crew, but one mind and purpose ruled the brig, and a braver command never 
spread canvas on the sea. Parole was a man eminently gifted by nature. He might have shone the 
sun of the council hall, and won the huzzas of a grateful people. Bland and strangely winning in his 
manners, he could have moved the grace and delight of polished society, the noble votary of woman. 
Yet she never swayed his heart, glory never dazzled his eye ; for the first and darling passion of his 
soul was revenge. Once, indeed, his young bosom thrilled to the impulses of love and ambition ; 
but, in a single hour, he was changed from a happy, dreaming boy, to a daik and revengeful man. 
The story of that change is one of the shameful many that blot the histoiic page. 

On one of those quiet and beautiful streams that steal away from the bosom of the Chesapeake, 
enamored of vales and flowers, was an humble yet tasteful cottage, the birth place of Samuel Parole, 
The lad was sixteen years of age when his father was killed in a naval action in the revolutionary 
war. Weeping in his mother's arms, and pressing to his bosom a fond and lovely sister who had 
shared his cradle, the young Parole saw a British uniform at the door, and heard the oaths and in- 
solence of marauders. A sickening scene of plunder and foul insult ensued. The mother was struck 
to the floor, and her blood streamed upon the sacred hearth, while her maddened son was held down 
by a minion's foot upon his neck. A tall giant of a soldier snatched a familj'- watch from the sister's 
bosom, and caught her in his foul embrace. The poor girl seized a knife in her wild despair, when 
the coward felled her senseless by a blow on her cheek, and bore her from the room. The infuriated 
brother broke at last from his pursuers and fled to his sister's chamber. It was too late — the hellish 
deed was done, and the fiend was gone. The scream and embrace of the agonized lad recalled his 
sister to life and the bitter sense of dishonor. In an instant the resolve of the high-souled girl was 
made. She plunged the knife her grasp had never yet relaxed, into her breast, and her pure hearths 
blood deluged her brother's bosom. 

For hours the young Parole was lurking around the track of the marauding band. At last, making 
a circuit of several miles, he secreted himself in a road-side thicket, and as the troop straggled past he 
singled out the tall murderer of his sister, and shot him through the heart. Fleet as the prairie deer 
he escaped, and enlisted at once in the continental ranks. Draughted in a corps of skirmishers, he 
became a fatal marksman, and never drew a trigger that an enemy fell not. When peace was de- 
clared he vowed enmity to the British till death should cut him down. That dark oath was terribly 
: ulfiUed. 

Young Parole went to sea, and became captain of an American trader. When England took a hand 
in the dazzling game of the French Revolution, Parole disappeared, and for many long years his 
desolate mother mourned him as dead. At the declaration of the war of 1812 he came home, a sun- 
burnt man, with a foreign air and strong French accent. He had served under the tri-colored flag, 
and passed unhurt through the tremendous battles of the Nile and Trafalgar, His fearful oath was 
yet unfulfilled. 

The weather was glorious, and the Sea-Gull flew skimming over her gay blue home. On the 
morning after the rescue of De Berrian, she spoke an iron-hulled, taunt-masted yankec, who that 
night, had dodged a chase in the shape of a large thief-stealing schooner, that sailed like a witch in 
the eye of the wind. The chase was convoying a ship, and Jonathan guessed her to be "a tarnation 
privateer, no offence to the cloth." The adventurous son of cider and ginger-bread held his course 
untroubled by a fear, while the Sea-Gull wore to the southward, and ploughed the foam under every 
rag of her canvas. There is usually sharp fighting when two privateers of diflferent flags come across 
each other. They often have immense quantities of specie, and the rarest spoils of every clime. For 
this reason, aside from national animosity, an action between them is of the bloodiest nature. Many 
such dreadful fights have crimsoned leagues of the ocean that are hardly heard of on shore. In the 
stir of greater events the historian knows not, or fails to record them, and they sleep in the graves of 
their actors.

Noon wasted into crimson evening. It was the 25th of Novembei, 1812. The Sea-Gull was 
bowUng down a dozen leagues oti' the Brazils, in latitude 10° south. The sun set at last with a 
frown behind the fleecy edge of a bank of clouds. The look-out thought he saw the glimmer of a sail 
as the last glow went out in the west, but he could make nothing of it. Captain Parole glanced 
around for a moment, musingly paced the deck, and went below, desiring the officer of the watch to 
call him at any change of weather. An hour passed, and it was fast growing into a dismal night. 
The moaning easterly wind still hung on ; the far clouds in ambush to the northwest, peeped wearily- 
over the verge of the sea, and then came rolling on in sullen gloom like the funeral pageant of some 
spirit of darkness. One by one the twinkhng stars were wrathfully put out, till a small clear space 
no bigger than a mainsail was left uncovered, away down to the south and east. The sea was black, 
muttering, and hideous ; an oppressive silence reigned through the brig. The usual song and laugh, 
were hushed. Sometimes a large dark wave would rear up alongside, and sprawl away in a shower 
of sparks, and one might fancy he saw a skeleton ghost of the shipwrecked, rising in a shroud of fire. 
The fitful wind was now hurried like the swelling wail of an Eolian harp, then it fell with a rustle 
as of passing wings ; and the footfall of the watch, the creaking of the wheel, or a sharp flap aloft, 
as if some winged messenger of gloom had ran afoul, alone kept silence awake. 

It was near midnight, when the binnacle light faintly told its whereabout, that a forecastle coterie 
were listening mutely to a yarn of bloody interest. At the tragic denouement the superstitious Peter 
leaped from the circle, unable to stand any more, and leaned upon the weather waist. Something 
between a groan and a laugh escaped him, and he started aghast, for it was mysteriously answered. 
He listened for a dubious moment, when a stealthy " Hard alee !" was whispered in Iris larboad ear, 
and he heard an abrupt dashing of waves and the heavy boom of filling canvas. 

" Sail to windward !" he lustily sung, at the same moment that a tall spectral mass of spars and 
rigging loomed out of the darkness jam abeam. There was a cry and bustle on the Sea-Gull's deck, 
but it was drowned in a tremendous crash, as the cut-water of the strange sail stove in the quarter 
waist, and her flying-jib-boom became entangled in the fore-shrouds. 

Quick as lightning, a band of armed men were jumping aboard, when at the instant a wave leap- 
ed up between the vessels, dashing them apart like the arms of a strong man, and leaving the wreck 
of the jib-boom dangling overboard. A plunge or two, and a gurgling shriek, told that some had 
sprung too late, and fallen short. The boarders quailed at that appalling cry — victoiy was yet in 
their grasp ; — to have locked the hatches and mastered the watch would have been the work of a 
moment, but that precious moment was lost in hesitation. There they stood — few and awed on that 
nan-ow deck — their own vessel goiac ahead, and the drowning yell of their comrades ringing in their 
ears. It was only for an instant. The astonished crew of the Sea-Gull threw themselves on deck 
at the fierce commands of their leader, to be attacked by an enemy scarcely twenty in number. That 
bloody fray was over in a moment. Scorning the call to surrender, the foiled and maddened boarders 
were cut down to a man, hardly knowing whether by friends or enemies. 

" Short and sweet" — tauntingly laughed the dark captain — " they arc British hounds, I see — but 
where did they come from 1" 

" From the Tiger," exultingly answered De Berrian, from the deck, as he unlocked the death- 
clasp of a fallen foe, and stood upon his feet 

" Ha !" shouted Parole, "how do you know 1" 

"Here is my frioid, Juan De Alva," replied De Berrian, lifting the huge limber corpse by the 
open bosom of the shirt, and showing the savage moustached face of the Spaniard — " a prosperous 
cruise to Port Brimstone," he added ; and the dead was plunged heavily overboard. 

A shout now arose — there was no answer ; and the darkness was so intense that the mysterious 
assailant could no where be seen. 

" Beat to quarters," ordered the captain — " run out the cannonades there — clear away the long gun!" 

Hardly had he spoken, when a broadside from the lurking enemy came crashing through the 
rigging. The blaze of her guns lighted for a lurid moment the tall fleet-looking Tiger, covered with 
British colors. She was luffing on the starboard bow. The Sea-Gull fell to leeward, returning a 
raking fire. Again the Tiger opened, and the cannonade was instantly rapid and furious on both 
sides. Firing by the momentary flash of their guns, but little damage was sustained. Captain 
Parole's blood was up ; he gave the order to haul to windward, and lay alongside. The Sea-Gull 
answered not her helm, for it was suddenly and awfully calm. The buoyant brig rocked helplessly 
on the dead-swells, and the airless sails flapped without life on the creaking spars. 

The warning of that calm was not to be mistaken. By mutual consent, the enemies left their 
guns. Captain Parole looked around the sky for a moment, ordered every sail to be taken in, and 
even the top-masts and lighter spars to be housed. Many young sailors started at these orders, for they 
foretold a straggle with a fiercer enemy than man. 

" Bear a hand, my lads," — commanded the cool and inflexible captain — " we have plenty of sea 
room, and the Sea-Gull is at home in a humcane. When it is over she will feed on the carcass of 
the Tiger." 

" Well, eh !" ejaculated Peter, as he reached the yard-arm ; " can't see nothin — Tiger don't shine 
him eyes dis night. Hab saw many dark night fore dis, but dis do take de shine off 'em all !" 



THE PRIVATEER. 127 

"Avast there oakum hide," roaicd a seaman — " the old port admiral of the 8tyx has piped a 
couit martial to overhaul you for that desertion. D'ye see that hell of a cloud yonder? — why that's 
the constable and his gang coming after. you. Halloo, there goes a blue-light." 

It was a glimmer of lightning, that dimly traced the rigging around them ; a far lurid fksh like 
damp powder straggled away on the grim ocean's edge — then another, nearer and brighter, Hared 
up through an eaibattled array of ponderous clouds. The signal was instantly answered from the 
whole line of the horizon, till the sky was sheeted far and near like the burning of a city under.a 
pall of funeral smoke. The dread army was in motion on its path of death — the thunder came rumb- 
ling wiUi a distant tramp like the cumbersome rattle of artillery. Every thing aloft was snug. Cap- 
tain Parole took the wheel, and ordered the standing jib to be half hoisted, and the men to stand by 
with the down-haul. It was done,. and then the enemies were reeling and dippingitheir yard-arms 
within musket shot of each other: their crowded decks, grim cannon, painted masts, and copper 
bottoms glancing in the vivid lightning. A mass of ragged skirmishing clouds flew overhead, aad 
next came the vast opaque body, shooting up in tremendous pillars, and whirling grandly along. 
The' stunning howl of the storm was terribly distinct. All was blaze and deafening bursts — the sea 
was levelled into a foaming plain, for the tornado's path vras but a quarter of a mile distant. 

"Down jib!" thundered the American captain, when the first mad puff twirled the brig safely 
before the gale. More terrific than the earthquake's age-pent fuiy was the; burst that followed. 

The Sea-Gutl trembled from topmast to keel, and bounded away like the fawn starting from; the 
ravine's brink. The wind screamed its shrillest note, and the zigzag glare of the lightning ran down 
the reeking shrouds, and hissed upon the spray. Immense sheets of spray whirled above in a race 
with sweeping clouds, and fell conquered on the buried vessel. Torrents of rain brawled upon the 
decks, and towering foam-cliffs sprung unseen astern and broke impetuously over her — butthe Sea- 
GuU rose again and shook her dripping pinions unharmed. 

With a hand of iron, her captain bore upon the helm; his cap was blown away, and his heavy- 
hair parted over the forehead and streamed flat upon his cheeks. His eye was lit with that strange 
excitement that finds companionship in the terrible. Fearless and exulting, the commander pointed 
over the quarter, and there, at a cable length, the Tiger was bursting from a shroud of foam like the 
dead of the ocean at the last day. Her large white topsail was rent in ribbands from the yards, and 
playing with the lightning's blaze. She bore herself gallantly through, and strode away in defiance. 
Faster than the fleetest wave the enemies scudded side-by-side. It was a terrific moment ; yet stmnge 
to say, fierce passions were then at work. At one of the frightful pauses of the hurricane, the prir 
vateers exchanged broadsides. The deluging rain had ceased as suddenly as it came, and for an 
hour they fired at every chance, the lightning showing the mark. The furious wind at length some- 
what abated, and the thirsting enemies bore up a point to close, and end the combat by the bloody 
method of boarding. The waves were short and tremendous, and the guns could not be worked. 
It seemed a reckless attempt to lay alongside; but the only fear of either was that the other might 
escape. 

Captain Parole called his ready men around him. He stood by the wheel, dressed in a shining 
boarding cap, light pumps, close fitting shirt, and trowsers girded very low in the waist with a sabre 
belt, in which were thrust two pair of long, glittering pistols. He drew a large and splendidly 
mounted sabre, which he stuck quivering in the deck beside him ; his right hand fell upon the hilt, , 
and his full chest swelled as he cast a flashing glance on that dark array, " Men," he spoke in a 
voice of deepest volume, " there are graves in the sand for some of us ; our foes are as eager as we — : i ? 
I lead the boarders — I want fifteen or twenty men for a post of honor." : /ii 

With a thrilling cheer the number was instantly made up, and theeecond lieutenant, a youth o£;ii 
fire, stood at their head. -ijot 

" Away to the fore-top," proudly continued the captain, " and spring into their rigging when w^ 
grapple. When I shout ' Ironsides,' drop to the deck, and receive the arms of the prisoners, or buiyi' 
me in the ocean." 

The men bounded away to their perilous duty. The heavy armed boarders stood close and eager, ; 
and the hostile vessels were rapidly closing. It was a scene of sublime and fearful interest. " Ready 
there, gunners," was the cry as their yard-arms cracked together, and each shot forth a last and 
deadly broadside. On the next wave, the Sea-Gull and the Tiger grappled fore and aft. 

With a bound and shout, Captain Parole touched the Tiger's deck amidships, followed by about 
forty of his crew. They stood for a moment on the open main deck between two dark bodies of 
men, who were about to board the Sea-Gull fore and aft at once. A rank of musquetry forward 
wheeled and fired with their gleaming barrels thrust into the faces of the boarders ; the murderous 
discharge flung many to the deck, and the flash revealed a strong body of men behind, wedged 
together, and grim with steel. Captain Parole loudly cheered and fired a shot, when the Amerieans 
saw the mass of men behind bursting through the opened ranks of the now useless musquetry, sabre 
in hand. They were led by a whiskered giant in a captain's uniform. At the same fierce whoop 
and bound the foes met like whirlwinds ; as each American crossed steel with his man he thrust 
a pistol to his throat and fired — they were clashing with the second rank.

" Away there, boarders !" shouted the British leader to the corps on the quarter-deck — " board ! 
board ! and the game is up ! — leave us to do the honors to these rogues." 

But the manoeuvre was anticipated. The yelling Tigers were crouching for a spring, when the 
Sea-GuUs pounced upon them dozen after dozen, till there was hardly loom to whirl a sabre on the 
slippery deck. In a moment the crowded schooner was an arena of the most desperate fighting — a 
hundred and fifty men were moving to and fro in that butchering work. When the ghastly light- 
ning flared again, the thick blood was jetting and bubbling from the scuppers. 

" Ironsides /" now thundered Parole, more hoarsely than the bellow of the storm. 

■" Ironsides ! We are coming ! Hurrah P'' echoed the young and enthusiastic De Berrian from 
the quarter deck, as, with Peter forever by his side, he fought with a nervous and powerful arm. 
The stirring watchword rang again from around and aloft, answered terribly by the defying yell of 
the enemy. The battle swept on, darker, bloodier, yet the party in the rigging came not. They had 
been intercepted by a nest of Tigers on the same errand. Curses and the ringing of sabres — scat- 
tering shots, and often a dead body falling with a whirl in the struggle below, or plunging singly 
overboard, gave evidence of a savage fight aloft. Long, long, was that battle undecided. The 
screams of rage and pain sounding above the brawl of the tempest — the infernal gloom, and ever 
and anon the blucish glare of lightning, or the while flash of fire-arms, disclosing hideously uplifted 
sabres, faces begiimmed and fierce, and bloody men locked, falling, stiffening in death, displayed a 
revel of fiends rather than a human fight. 

Struggling abaft the foiward hatch, and vainly contending with superior numbers, was the Ame- 
rican leader and his band. The unheeded slain were cumbering the deck, yet no shout of victory 
rang over the din. Parole was in his element, and at every stroke of his terrible sabre he yelled the 
dark oath of his bhghted youth. 

" The wedge — the wedge — give them the wedge !" he shouted, leaping before his men as they 
ranged away in a triangular body behind him. " Well done my boys — drive on !" and, almost 
alone, he cleared a honid path through the astonished ranks. Few men could follow him in that 
reckless feat. The mad captain turned when no enemy stood before him, and at once he saw the 
fatal error of his success. Part of his men were surrounded away amid the foe, and those that ga- 
thered beside him were panting and few. For the first time that strange man felt fear ; yet when 
his tremendous voice shouted again, " Keep together my brave boys, and mow down to the gang 
way," there was not a qxiiver in ifs tone. The work was impossible to all but him. 

The British were furious and unshaken; in another moment all would be lost. In that agonizing 
thought the American captain was fast losing self-command. The dying cries of iiis beloved men 
bereft him of reason ; he was maddened, and the time for the prodigy of his valur had arrived. At 
mce, as if the resistless lightning dwelt in his :^ingle arm, he bounded away, and fought with the 
headlong fury of a maniac. 

" Clear the deck, or sink with the dogs in their kennel," he thundered, cleaving down a heavy 
Biiton who sought to grasp with him. The taunt went alike to friend and foe ; for, at once, from 
Doth sides, a sickening shout of " No quarter," rent the air. The tall Biitish commander, in the 
hellish struggle that ensued, singled out the American, and the fire whizzed from their sabres. 

" Dogs are we," muttered the Brilon through his clenched teeth, " then thus we throttle midnight 
thieves." 

" Dogs ye are!" roared the infuriated Parole, hurling a discharged pistol in the other's face, and, 
ere- he could recover, the American swept his skull skimming overboard, and stamped on the pros- 
trate body. Like a tortured fiend unbound. Parole now burst among the contending mass. Fight- 
in^dn his frenzied might, an invisible power seemed to guard him. Pistols blazed in his face, and 
reeking sabres shivered over his head, yet he coursed without a scar. 

It was a last and critical moment when a straggling body of Tigers came running forward, and a 
stira-ing hurrah of victory rang from the quarter deck. In the wild chorus, mingled the deep toned 
voice of De Berrian, cheering to the rescue of their captain and his followers. They were not a mo- 
ment too soon, for Parole was singly engaged with a host, and the rest were surrounded, beaten, and 
falling at every blow. The impetuous victors hurled themselves upon the British rear, and then 
came the last dread struggle of war. It was the crisis — it was past ; the vanquished and bleeding 
Britons threw down their sabres at the offer of quarter, only when they could not raise an unwound- 

ed arm. 

And again that wild, screeching, unearthly yell of victory echoed over the dismal ocean. A fainter 
answer went up from the shrouds, and seven mutilated Americans staggered to the deck, and fell 
into the arms of their comrades. They were all that lived of the intrepid corps that were posted in 
the foretop. They came alone, which told the story of their bloody victory — their young lieutenant 
came not with them.

THE CHURCH'S LAMENT FOR ST. JOHN 



He hath gone to the place of his rest, 

He is safe in the home of his God ; 
And we who have loved him, forsaken, oppressed, 

Submissive would bow to the rod. 
Though his accents can cheer us no more. 

His love yet may speak from the grave ; 
And thus on the broad wing of Faith may we 
soar 

To One who is mighty to save ! 

Our friend and our father we heard 

On earth, paint the glorips of heaven ; — 
But now the lone church, lilte a wandering 
bird. 

To the home of the desert is driven. 
Entranced on his visions we hung ; 

Our hearts and our hopes were above; 
For the words of Persuasion fell soft from his 
tongue. 

And the soul of his teaching was Love. 

In vain the stern Tyrant assailed 

With threats of the dungeon or grave — 
He spoke bat the word, and the timid ne'er 
quailed. 
In pangs that had mastered the brave. 
The babe hath endured, while its frame 
fe%.With the scourge and the torture was torn — 
The maiden, the mother, in chariots of flame 
To glory triumphant were borne. 



For what were thy terrors, O Death 1 

And where was thy triumph, O Grave ? 
When the vest of pure white and the conquering 
wreath 

Were the prize of the scorned and the slave. 
Oh ! then to our Father was given. 

To read the bright visions on high ; 
He gave to our view the full glories of heaven ; — 

We heard and we hastened to die ! 

Some died — they are with thee above — 

Some live — they lament for thee now — 
But who would recall thee, blest Saint, from the 
love 

That circles with glory thy brow 1 
Long, long didst thou linger below, 

But the term of thy exile is o'er. 
And praises shall mix with the tears that nrust 
flow 

From the eyes that behold thee no more. 

Praise — praise — that thy trials are past ! 

Joy — joy — that thy triumph is won ! 
The thrones are completed — for thine is the last 

Of the twelve that encircle the Son ! 
O Lord ! shall the time not be yet 

When thy church shall be blessed and free 1 
Thou who canst not forsake, and who will not 
forget. 

Come quickly — or take us to Thee ! 



THE MARTYR TO HIS APOSTATE JUDGE 



No ! — think not I could ever be 

False to my Saviour's honored name. 

For aught that thou canst offer me — 
A little life — a little fame : — 

'Twere weak indeed to lose for them 

A never-fading diadem. 

Thou hear'st my fixed resolve ; — and now 
The guards — the rack — the flame prepare ; 

And count me weak and false as thou, 
If I fall back, or tremble there. 

Go thou, thy bleeding Lord disown ; 

Be mine the faithful Martyr's crown. 



Ay ! thou may'st smile — but not in scorn, 
Proud minion of the despot's will ; 

Thy direst vengeance have I borne. 
And stand prepared to bear it still ; 

My pride, my triumph it shall be, 

To die for Him who died for me. 

And if one passing pang I feel, 
Deluded man ! 'tis felt for thee ; 

I stand prepared the truth to seal. 
But what shall thy departing be ? 

Blest Saviour ! Lord of earth and heaven, 

Oh ! be his sins — and mine — forgiven ! 



THE INF E R N A L BOX 



TRAJifSLATED FROH THE PSESC: 



PRELIMINARY RE M A R K S . 

The story which follows. is true in every particular, and can be supported, if necessary, by te^sti- 
mony of th^ most respectable character. The individual who therein plays the principal part has 
he^n variously distinguished. Men of fashion study his 'elegance of manner, and philosophers es- 
teem his profound erudition. He is the nephew of that illustrious man and great orator, M. Royer 
Collard ; but he is .something more than the nephew of a great man^hc is himself eminent for 
genius and acquirements , in a word, it is M. Hypolite Royer Collard, one of the most distinguish- 
ed professors of the medical faculty of Paris, and at the same time, and by an anomaly purely Pa- 
risian, the mgst exquisite dandy that ever trod the Boulevard of Ghent. 

My story, then, js matter of history, and having thus premised, I enter upon the subject. At the 
same time, let it be understood that I intend no attack upon the reputation or honor of M. Royer 
Collard. The mystification on which this narrative is founded, and of which he was the victim, 
■was not .aimed at thei -Professor, but at tlie Roue. My aim shall be the same. 



THE INFERNAL BOX. 

If Paris be the wonder of the world, the opera is the wonder of Paris. The opera is the essence 
of that society, which is in itself the extiact of all other society. 

One of the front boxes of the Parisian Eldoiado has received a singular surname — that of the 
Infernal Box. Not because it is haunted by those tempting demons with angelic features, whose 
seductions have gained so many souls to Lucifer. No woman has ever entered the Infernal Box. 
The demons of this hell are good devils enough, who, in point of virtue, have hardly triumphed 
over any virtue but that of an opera nymph. These demons are by no means malicious. The In- 
fernal Box is thus termed because in it they make, tin hncit d^enfer — literally, " a hell of a noise." 
For a considerable length of time it has been the rendezvous of a set of roystering blades, generally 
of high rank, who thus endeavor to continue in our own age the traditions of the Regency. The 
Don Juans of the Cafe Anglais, free livers of some renown, meet there of evenings, and assemble 
to display their chivalric graces and their folly. 

The life of these men, and iheir marmers, cause no little astonishment to a stranger who has not 
comprehended the object of this society, which, through a peculiarity which it were easy to explain, 
carefully conceals its good qualities, in order to display with ostentation its bad ones. Pure coquet- 
ry ! for beneath this apparent frivolity there exists an incontestible superiority, and even a real and 
bitter sadness. 

To behold the occupants of the Infernal Box assume a rudeness almost disgusting, and point their 
opera glasses with insolent effrontery at the features and dress of the ladies — to hear their shouts of 
laughter whilst every one else is silent— this, I say, would excite in a stranger mingled feelings of 
pity and indignation. He would take these men to be some of thpse illustrious nullities, who pro- 
menade their uselessness, their idleness, and their yellow gloves, from the wood of Boulogne to 
Frascati and the opera. But. pity would ere long give place to astonishment. In fact, these dandies 
are men. After Byroii and Pejham, th§ir. masters, and models, they have made of folly a sy^^tem 
and a mode of life. 

Who form this society at the present day, I know not ; hut at the time of my , history, (a year 
previous to the revolution of July,) the infei;pal phalanx was composed of men who have Mnce, be- 
come celebrated under various titles. . Cave and Ditmer, the witty. authors of "Soirees de Neuilly," 
were of the party. Mignet, the historian,. was one of the faithful. Romieu, the king of good livers, 
•who is now changed into a magistrate, and thunders against the '.'excesses of pur evil passions," he 
■who was one evening found dead drupk at a corner, surmounted by two lamps with the following 



THE INFERNAL BOX. 131 

insciiption, " carriages do not pass hcie," — this Romieu, who in days of yore caused so much cha- 
grin to municipal authorities, and so many sleepless nights to prefects of police — Romieu, formerly 
the most joyous man, and the greatest mystificator in all France and Navarre, and at present, by a 
just recompense, the most mystified man in Christendom — this Romieu was a leader in the infernal 
band. 

Montalivet, now minister, a man of racy spirit then, was the right hand of Romieu. Editors of 
the opposition, and they who espoused legitimacy, after having crossed pens in the morning, came 
in the evening to the Infernal Box, to a strife of wit and puns. (Puns were in fashion then.) Some 
aristocratic rakes, and finally, M. Hypolite Royer Collard, completed the sacred phalanx. All these 
men occupy, at this present day, with much talent, important and difiicult posts : which proves that 
the hide of a graceless -varlet, turned inside out, will make excellent stuff for a statesman. 

M. HypoUte Royer Collard was the Don Juan of the society, and his manners conformed to this 
chaiacter. 

One evening, a piece that drew all Paris was played at the opera. The house was full, and the 
Infernal Box in full complement. The infernals were in humor for wit and insolence. More than 
once their shameless bursts of laughter had disturbed the general emotion. The pit growled^ the 
stalls murmured, the boxes were in agitation and whispered. Some young men in the galleries be- 
gan to cast towards the Infernal Box menacing glances. The insurrection threatened to become ge- 
neral. But the infernals were accustomed to these storms, and prepared to make head against the 
impending one. Suddenly, there was a movement in the house. Two persons had just entered the 
only box which had remained empty. Every one has had occasion to remark the sensation which 
is experienced on seeing one Ijox empty, whilst the rest of the house is full to overflow. Whoever 
then comes in to occupy the vacant place is sure to attract attention, at least for some moments. All 
eyes were immediately turned towards the new comers. One was a man, the other a very young 
woman, of great beauty. This incident, although of no unusual occurrence, sufficed to change the 
current of popular feeling. The opera-glasses of the Infernal Box were immediately levelled at the 
lady whose arrival had been so apropos, and nothing else was thouglrt of but to obtain some infor- 
mation respecting her. 

*' I have never seen her before," says Romieu. 

" Nor I," replied every one else in the box. 

" It must be some pretty provincial, just arrived !" 

" Pshaw! behold her elegance and grace! I will hold you Hypolite's horse against Talivet's til- 
bury, that this fair flower has opened in the Fauxbourg St. Germain ! Is there a shape like that in 
the provinces V 

" Respect the departments ! They improve daily, and I am acquainted with some women who 
have beautiful eyes and a very passable figure." 

" Every man for himself. The viscount is about to begin the history of his love adventures !" 

" Messieurs," observes the viscount, " I swear by the head of Romieu, that this woman does jiot 
belong to the noble Fauxbourg — probably I know her — she is decidedly, gentlemen, a rose of the 
province. Happy the man who may first breathe the delicious perfume." 

" There's a beautiful poetical flower for _you," cries Mignet; then turning to a young man ele- 
gantly dressed, he added, " put that into your book." 

The young man addressed is a poet who makes adorable elegies, impressed with ineffable sadness, 
during the brief respites which he obtains from speculations on exchange, gambling, and opera girls, 
To read his productions, one would suppose him to be consumptive, and a lover of the pale rays of 
the moon. He is a Hercules, who leads the life of hell itself. 

" For heaven's sake," replies he, " no poetry to-night ! I feel gloomy yet with my last ode to 
melancholy." 

" Is it possible," cries Romieu, " that people make odes to melancholy 1 'Tis horrible, upon my 
SGul ! An ode to champagne might pass !" 

" Champagne !" cries Mignet, " shame upon you ! Champagne is naught but a chimera, a mere 
deception, fit only for pensioners I" 

" Who blasphemes champagne 1" demands Romieu, with a majestic air. " Apropos to charopagixe, 
I invite you to sup to-night with the viscount. Come, it is time — come, Mignet !" 

" Well," says ^fignet, rising with an air of resignation, " we must occasionally sacrifice to po- 
liteness." 

As the company was departing, Romieu observed that Hypolite Royer Collard remained in the 
box. 

" Come, Hypolite !" cries he. 

" I am not with you this evening ; I need all my senses !" 

" And what the devil are you about to do 1" 

Hypolite leaned towards Romieu and whispered something in his ear. 

" Gentlemen," cries Romieu, turning to the joyous band, " Hypolite has just poured his heart inta 
mine ! He is smitten with the fair unknown, and he must go to night to sing a romance, beneath 
her chamber window. He wishes to know if some of you will lend him a guitar !" 



132 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" Don't be a child," ciies the viscount ; " come to supper ! You will lose your time and your 
trouble !" 

" Perhaps !" 

« Will you bet?" 

" I will !" 

" A hundred louis !" 

" Done !" 

The two epicureans touched hands, and Romieu arranged the terms of the bet as if it were an or- 
dinary one. For them, in fact, the stake was not very heavy — a hundred louis and a woman's ho- 
nor ! 

« Remain, then," said Romieu, as he departed, " and recollect that you have fifteen days only !" 

When the fair unknown, leaning on the arm of her escort, quitted the opeia, she observed a man 
who made himself a path towards her through the crowd, and regarded her with passionate earnest- 
ness. Then she cast down her eyes, and dared no longer to look around. In going from the thea- 
tre to her hotel, it appeared to her also that a carriage followed her own. These two incidents trou- 
bled her a little, but she soon forgot them ; and when she fell asleep, she dreamed neither of the 
opera, nor the stranger. The angels of dreams, during her repose, cauied her, on their white wings, 
far from Paris, under the pure sky of her native town. But when she arose, all fresh and rosy, and 
ran to the window to breathe the fresh morning air, she perceived ai man passing under the balcony, 
and recognized the stranger. 

" Ah, my God !" cried she, « this gentleman has strange manners ! I am afraid there would be a 
quarrel, or I would speak to my brother about it !"

A LO VE-LE TTE R, 

If there exist in Paris (this unjustly slandered city) nruch corruption, it is not that less virtue is 
found there than elsewhere ; but it is that vice there knows how to be amiable, and how to encircle 
its enemy with snares often inevitable. 

In Paris, exists a class of men who have made the art of seduction a perfect science. They at- 
tack a woman as a fortified place. They know precisely how many curves and parabolas their sighs 
must describe before firing the heart of their firture conquest. Love is for them an algebraic equa- 
tion, and their plan of attack is always graduated in proportion to the means of resistance. 

And these men are more dangerous, inasmuch as their infamous calculations are not always the 
result of a frigid egotism. Commonly, they owe their experience to long suffering and numberless 
deceptions. By the wounds inflicted on their own hearts, they have learned to know the vulnerable 
points of the hearts which they attack. If pitiless, it is because they have not been pitied. They 
retaliate upon others the mortal blows which they have received. They not only seduce, they avenge 
themselves. 

There exist, however, obstacles, against which all their science fails. And as famous fencers are 
generally killed by youngsters who know not how to hold a sword, thus all the experience of these 
famous seducers is set to nought and frustrated by the ignorance and simplicity of a school-girl. 

About noon, Louise de ***** left the hotel, accompanied by lier brother, and visiting the richest 
shops in Paris, there made numerous purchases. She observed that a man followed her at a dis- 
tance, and stopped when she stopped. As often as she came out of a shop she hoped to be relieved 
from the impertinent pursuit of this stranger, but to her sur-prise, he still followed. Finally, she 
came to the celebrated shop of Susse ; the crowd was great, and it behoved to wait a little. But 
what was her amazement when she perceived M. Hypolite Royer Collard (for it was he) approach- 
ing her in silence, pretending to examine the objects placed on the counter. 

Louise de ***** held in her hand one of those bags which are called reticules. As she held it 
out to the clerk to have her purchase therein placed, Hypolite, who was near her, took the purchase 
from the hands of the clerk, and handed it to Louse de *****. All this was done in a very natu- 
ral way. At this moment, the brother of the young girl returned, and cast upon Royer Collard a 
glance almost threatening. 

This scene, so ordinary in appearance, was not however deficient in a certain degree of interest. 
Royer Collard turned about coolly, as if he had performed a simple act of politeness, yet, notwith- 
standing, in the packet which he handed to Louise de *****, he had slipped a letter. At this inso- 
lence, the young girl grew pale with indignation, but she had noticed her brother's glance, and 
dreading an explosion, the result of which might be terrible, she restrained herself. To return, or 
to destroy the letter was impossible; a scene would inevitably ensue. On that Hypolite had trusted. 
The young girl put up the package, at the same time casting upon Royer Collard a glance of con- 
tempt, which seemed to say, &lt;' I take your letter because I cannot do otherwise ; but you are beneath 
notice." 



THE INFERNAL BOX. 133 

" That is possible," replied Hypolite Royer Collard, in the same language ; " nevertheless, you 
have received my letter !" 

That evening, when Hypolite met the infernals,he replied to Romieu, who demanded news of his 
adventure — " The aflair is in excellent train ! I believe I shall win the bet — I have a superb plan 
there," added he, striking his forehead. 

Unfortunately, Hypolite was unable to put his plan into effect, for he learned the next day that 
Louise de **'■** and her brother had quitted Paris, and no one had been informed of their destina- 
tion. 



THE PLOT. 

' Some days after this event, a scene sufficiently singular occurred at Brest, in the saloon of Ma- 
dame de *****, among some ladies who had met togethci-. They were seven in number, and witfi 
the exception of one lady, no one was over twenty-live years of age. Tears are becoming to a wo- 
man, but I believe that laughter is still more so. These ladies, then, were laughing so heartily that 
teais actually came into their eyes. Sometimes a calm was gradually re-established ; their features 
resumed foi a few moments a gravity which endured but a short space. A demure smile, or a word 
spoken in a low voice, was the signal for renewed merriment. To look at them thus, these sprightly 
creatures were charming. One of them, a brunette, erect as the palm, u black-eyed beauty, sfeemEd 
to take the lead in the general merriment. Twenty times had she attempted to enforce silence, and 
finish a sentence as many times commenced ; in vain did this young girl essay to put on a serious 
"visage ; all that she could accomplish was to pout a little, which became her charmingly. At this 
moment a young man entered. On his appearance, the effort made to check the mirth only served 
to give it double force. At lirst he gazed in amazement, but the example was contagious, and lie 
soon laughed more heartily than any. This lasted for more than a quarter of an hour. 

" Ah, my God ! how good it is to laugh !" cried one of the foolish creatures, as she wiped away 
the tears which came to her eyes. 

" Cousin," said the young man, approaching the lady of whom we have already made mention, 
" there must be some mischief afoot, that you laugh so heartily ! May I be made acquainted with 
the cause of so much gaiety ] 

" I give you a hundred guesses, Henry; I give you a thousand ! Guess!" 

" But you know very well, cousin, that I never guess a riddle!" 

" Well ! it is too ridiculous ! Louise has a lover !" 

" Certainly, a very extraordinary incident !" rephed the young man, carelessly. " Whose head 
would she not turn ] I make no allusion to myself — that would be awkward for a pretender — more- 
over, it is my profession," added he, putting his hand to his heart, and looking slily at Louise, who 
was blushing like the rose. 

'•' Oh yes, certainl}^," said the cousin, who would not see the signs which Louise was making to 
her: " but this one is not a dying lover, to say the least. He goes straight ahead, and has already 
come to love letters !" 

" Ah, indeed]" exclaimed the young man, with an emotion which he was unable to repress, and 
which caused new bursts of laughter. 

Henry leaned majestically against the mantel, observing, " God forgive me, cousin, but I really 
must believe that you have lost your senses !" 

" Don't stir!" exclaimed the young giil, "don't stir! you are superb in that position ! You re- 
semble precisely the portrait of Tony Johannot !" 

" But what letter is this ? and who is this man ]" demanded Henry, impatiently. 

" None of your business, my little cousin ; we have our own secrets ! Nevertheless, if you pro- 
mise me something, I will give you the letter, with the signature." 

" Whatever you please." 

" You hear him, ladies ! Well, I demand that you play Boston for the space of eight days with? 
our good aunt Beaupre !" 

" Oh, my God !" cried Henry, in alarm. " Nevertheless," resumed he, working up his courage 
by degrees, " I will play Boston — I will play Loto, if necessary — I will make riddles — I resign my- 
self in all things: but, for God's sake, give me the letter !" 

The cousin took the letter from her bosom. " There it is !" said she. 

The young man stepped forward to seize it. 

" One moment, cousin ! I have yet to impose another condition." 

" No more conditions ; Boston is enough !" cried Heniy, pursuing his cousin, who ran across the 
room, but was soon caught. 

Henry opened the lettei with some agitation. Affecting gaiety, he did not the less feel that his 
heart was beating with unusual force. " H. Royer Collard," exclaimed he, perceiving the signature, 
then he turned to Louise, and inquired how the letter had come into her possession. The couski.

pitying Louise's embarrassment, told what the reader knows already. However, the countenance of 
the young man, for an instant gloomy, gradually cleared up. 

" You have done well, my dear Louise, to avoid scandal. This Royer Collard is the nephew of 
the orator. He is a man of talent, but boasts a sovereign contempt for wOman. Above all, he is 
passionately fond of notoriety, and it is fortunate that your brother perceived nothing." 

Here is the tenor of the note, which Henry read in a loud voice : 

Mademoiselle — I love you, and I must tell you so. I beg neither pardon nor excuse for my 
Tboldness ; my passion excuses itself. At all events, I will love you forever, near, or at a distance. 
I offer you my life, accept it or not-^and I will be yours as you shall be mine. This I swear to you 
before God. H. Roxer Collard. 

" Admirably absurd !" exclaimed the cousin. 

*' Not so absurd !" repUed the old lady. " In these affairs there can be nothing too extravagant. 
If this M. Royer Collard, who is a man of genius, has written such an absurdity, he has a reason 
for it I Be assured of that !" 

" r faith," remarked Henry, " phrases are like liquors — bad ones attack the head ; moreover, I 
have known Royer Collard, and he is not awkward in these affairs. But, look ye ! who in the devil 
is he addressing himself to 1 To that fair angel there, who has, I am sure, never read a romance ! 
You have never read one, have you, Louise 1 The most comical thing in all this, is, that Royer 
Collard, who has his affairs arranged in peifect order, has always in readiness letters of this kind. 
He has two drav/ers — one for married, the other for unmariied ladies. His correspondence is al- 
ways prepared in advance, and serves for every passion. This is economy in time and imagination. 
His letters are ticketed and numbered. For a letter like this, he opens case No. I — the threat of 
suicide is, I beheve. No. 27 ; the letter of adieu is No. 30, the last of the series. I know two ladies 
who have received from him letters like this, which has no longer the advantage of being unpublish- 
ed, for it certainly has reached its hundredth edition." 

■" The impertinent fellow !" exclaimed the brunette, " Oh ! if we could only play him a good 
trick !" 

" Ah, yes ! we must make sport of him," cried all the ladies, with most touching unanimity. — 
" But how 1 — there is no way of doing it ! — 'tis impossible !" 

" Silence !" exclaimed the brunette, with a musing air ; " I have an idea !" 

Then all the chairs came closer together — all these pretty heads approached each other. The 
cousin spoke for more than an hour — without interruption ! — and when she had concluded, all arose 
with exclamations of delight. 

The elder ladies smiled — the younger ones jumped about like children, clapping their hands to- 
gether, and exclaiming, " What sport we shall have !" The soft light of a lamp cast its mellow 
jadiance on the joyous group. 

" I," cried Henry, " will be your secretary." 

* * * * * * * 

All this time Royer CoUaid was in a strange perplexity. It was not the probable loss of his hun- 
dred louis which he feared, but the pleasantries with which the infernals were sure to assail him. — 
For ten days, he had not daied to appear at the Box. He was, above all, afraid of Romieu, and 
he perceived and avoided him at a great distance. One day, however, he met him when it was im- 
possible to shun him. 

" Well," exclaims Romieu, " when do you come to claim your hundred louis 1 — this is the day 
on which they are due you. What ate you doing'? What has become of you? Happy mortal ! 
you are in the honeymoon, I presume ! Truly, I recognize you no longer — you are of an antedi- 
luvian constancy ! Love must not thus wrong friendship ! Oi, can it be possible that your vanity 
has received a check 1 Was she cruel 1 That would be unfashionable ! Ah ! I perceive you have 
lost your wager ! It is certainly a misfortune ! If you are not in funds, console yourself, my dear 
fellow ! Here am I — and will I not pay for you 1 A friend is a friend, or he is not !" 

" Let me be!" said Hypolite, impatiently. " To-night I will go to the Box." 

Hypolite had decided upon the plan which he thought best to adopt. 

" I will go there to-night — they will laugh at me — but what matter 1 An hour is soon passed." 

When he returned home, they handed him a letter, dated at Rennes. " From whom can this 
te 1" thought he; " I know no one at Reimes." But when he had read it, he exclaimed aloud with 
delight- 

" 'Tis she !" cried he. " Oh ! I see we need despair of nothing!" and he kissed the letter. 

His servant beheld this in amazement. For years he had never seen him kiss a love-letter. 

" Fool !" said Royer Collard, who divined his thoughts, " it is not for the woman, but because 
she has made me gain my wager ! Now I shall laugh at them !" and he cut two capers across the 
Toom. 

Vanity can render a man foolish, as well as love. With an air of triumph, Royer Collard show- 
ed himself in the Infernal Box.

A MORNING'S MEDITATION IN A BURIAL PLACE. 



How often^ when the holy cahn of the evening hour has wooed me from the world, have I stolen 
away from the monotonous hum of the village, and strolled amongst these habitations of the depart- 
ied. Many a moonlight hour have I here consecjated to chaste and holy thought. But never before 
methinks did this silent city of the dead so alluiingly invite to meditation as now. The eastern sky 
is just beginning to Wush^ — the minstrel of the wood, perched upon yonder bending bougb, carols 
melodiously its matin hymn ; and the timid lark, affrighted by the unwonted footstep of an intru- 
der, flutters from its retreat beneath the sculptured slab, and 

Soars till the unrisen sun 
Beams on its speckled breast. 

All animated nature is returning to life, but the tenants of these earthly tenements wake not. Theirs 
is the sleep th«t the archangel's trump alone can dispel. There is an intrinsic pleasure in melan- 
choly that the thoughtless know not of, and no place so appropriate for its indulgence as this. 
Whilst I tread the grassy turf, methinks I hear a voice from the depth of the grave exclaim, " The 
place whereon thou standest is holy ground." As I gaze round upon this charnel enclosure, and 
note the graven monuments of the affluent in life — the plain, unornamented stone, that marks the 
resting place of him who possessed barely enough, and the neglected hillock that presses the breast 
of the poor min — I am taught a lesson of humility, and of contempt for the " lying vanities of life," 
which can be learned only from a contemplation of " man's latter end." 

Omniscient God ! why permittest thou the rich man to oppress, despise, and frown upon the 
poor, who is as good by nature, perhaps better by practice, than he') Why is he allowed to " flour- 
ish like a green bay-tree," while he refuses the helping hand of charily, nay, even the smile of re- 
cognition, to the virtuous poorl But man, vain man, camiot 

-with his short-lived plummet 



Fathom the vast abyss of heavenly justice. 

Despite the fulsome panegyric inscribed upon yonder sepulchral stone, the Dives, whose virtues— 
/though virtues he had none — it blazons forth, may in another world, implore that the Lazarus, over 
whom he lorded it here, may be sent with his finger dipped in water to cool his parched tongue.

" It must be so." The soul of man is immortal. When weeping relatives follow to the mortuary 
their departed friend, what else than a confidence that the soul is " secure in her existence," can 
sustain their sorrowing spirits'? Who is there remembermg that " God made man after his own 
image," can look upon the church-yard, crowded with the sepulchres of those that are gone, and not 
exclaim, 

Non omnis moriar 1 

It cannot be that, within that narrow tabernacle, is contained all that was of the great and good 
man whose name is chiseled upon the marble structure reared to his memory. 

Quern terra amisit, lucrifecit Coelum, 

Novo splendore 
Corporis resuscitati, vitaeque eternse, 
Cum Domino Jesu, omnibusque Sanctis 
Ovantem rediturum. 

These are the concluding words of the encomiastic epitaph carved "upon his mausoletun, and n» 

one who knew Charles N , his mighty mind, and the holy purity of his life, dares to doubt 

their verity.

Can any sceptic read this simple mausoleum inscription without being forced to the conviction 
that the soul of her, of whom it is commemorative, survives the body. 

This Monument is dedicated to the Memory of 
a beloved daughter, 

MARY BLAINE W , 

who died 

on the 8th day of January, A. D., 1836. 

aged 15 years. 

They that have seen thy look in death. 
No more need fear to die. 

An infinitely just and all-wise God would not have taken from earth one so young, so "be- 
loved," had it not been to invest hei with a crown of immortality. 

k Mary died as dies the christian. I saw her but once — she was a lovely girl, but the flushed cheek 
and sunken eye told too truly that she was consumption's victim. Treacherous disease ! that never 
permits the sufferer to doubt a restoration to health till the hour of dissolution is just at hand. To 
Mary, 

" Hope told a flattering tale," 

and she thought not that she would die, until her wasted foim was laid upon the couch of death, 
and then she felt that her spirit must ere long depart. A little while, and her sarcophagus was 
borne to this home of the dead. 

On the day after her burial — a cold, wintiy day — I sat upon a grave-stone near her tomb, and 
■with a pencil traced, in " homely phrase," upon the attrite marble this 

DIRGE, 

SUeGESTED BY MARt's DEATH. 

Her voice is hushed ; no more is seen 

The loved one decked in beauty's bloom ; 
Come sorrow, in thy saddest mein. 

And chant a requiem o'ei her tomb. 
Ye wintry winds blow softly by 

The sacred spot where Mary sleeps ; 
Where sable sadness breathes her sigh, 

And gloomy grief her vigil keeps. 

The spotless, peerless, guiltless one, 

Who ne'er on vice's threshold trod ; 
Whose earthly couise had scarce begun. 

Now, lifeless, moulders 'neath the clod. 
The guileless heart that yet had learned 

To wear the garb of truth alone — 
And every baneful folly spurned, 

The turgid earth-worm claims its own. 

Successive years may glide away ; 

Oblivion tarnish memory's page — 
But Mary's name shall not decay 

Whilst one who knew her treads life's stage. 
And when the last of those shall leave 

This terrene world, who knew her well. 
Let none presume the name to breathe 

Of her whose worth they cannot tell. 

Come, let us round her hallowed shrine, 

O'erspread with garb of sombre gloom — 
A wreath of peaceful cypress twine, 

And plant with evergreens her tomb. 



THE DYING WIFE.

When spring-lime bids the red-breast come, 

And o'er her pour his mournful lay ; 
Wild roses then, of sweet perfume, 

We'll gather from the dew-dipt spray. 

At close of the departing day. 

Their leaves, on Mary's grave, will spread ; 
And garlands, woven of flow'rets gay, , 

We'll scatter o'er the slumb'ring dead. 
Ye breezes bleak blow softly by 

The sacred spot where Mary sleeps ; 
Where sable sadness breathes her sigh, 

And gloomy grief her vigil keeps. 

The mother who dedicated a monument " to the memory of a beloved daughter," planted roses 
and evergreens around the tomb of her lost one : but they are now neglected. There is no hand to 
nurture them ; for that mother, too, has gone to the home of the blessed. Beneath yon tall, frondife- 
rous locust, through whose topmost boughs the morning sunbeams are just now beginning to peer, 
is she laid. Her grave is but one of the many scatteied around me, upon which the grass has not 
yet grown. Whose obsequies shall next be here celebrated 1 Perchance mine. Be it so. In yon- 
der unfrequented nook, where the sexton's spade has never yet disturbed the sod, would I be in- 
terred. S. D. A.

Part we at last, beloved ! 
'Tis but the karvest time of life — but we, 

Where once our footsteps roved 
No more together in our joy shall be. 

Methinks I see thee stand 
By the deserted hearth, all sad and lone. 

Grasping a shadowy hand. 
Or peopling air with my low voice's tone. 

I hear thy gentle sigh. 
When some pale flower, which I had fondly nurst. 

Brings to thy pensive eye 
Those vanish'd scenes where we had wander'd

I mark thy pale, pale cheek. 
When some fond kindred voice within thine ear 

Shall of me kindly speak, 
Calling from thy heait's depths a tribute tear. 

Yes, thou wilt sadly weep, 
I know thou wilt, when I have gone to rest ; 



And, o'er my dreamless sleep, 
Pour the low wailing of an aching breast. 

Oh ! mine own love, and true, 
Thou know'st how long my heart-strings round 
thee clung; 

How, year by year, they drew 
Closer the loving chords on which they hung. 

But we are parting now ; 
The links give way, the mighty charm is riven ; • 

Death, from my darken'd brow, 
Shuts out thy gentle love — my earthly Heaven. 

Yes, dearest, I depart, 
I feel thy warm breath o'er my wan cheek stray ; 

I hear thy throbbing heart. 
And yet, oh ! ruthless death, I must not stay, 

Thou'rt fading from my sight, 
And low, soft tones, in music round me swell;.

BEARDING THE BEY. 

In Ma}% 1805, commodore Ban-on returned to the United States in ill health, leaving commodore 
Rodgersin the Mediterranean, in command of the largest American squadion ever known. 

Commodore Rodgers immediately hoisted his flag on board the Constitution, and shortly after- 
wards, as the echo of the evening gun at the Valetta died along the shores of Malta, the fleet got un- 
der weigh, and stood over towards the African coast. It was on the eighth day after their departure 
when the squadron made cape Carthage, and on the ninth, at sunrise, anchored in the roads of Go- 
letta. Before the gallant frigates lay the city of Tunis, the abode of happiness, and the fountahi 
spring of jackasses and orange water. The signal for the consul to come on board was immediately 
made, and on the following day he repaired on board the Constitution, and gave the commodore a 
detailed account of his fruitless conferences with Hamouda Bey. A council of war was then called, 
at which Col. Lear, the consul-general, assisted, which resulted in the determination to bombard the 
town in the course of thhty-six hours, if a favorable answer was not returned to commodore Rod- 
gers' letter demanding satisfaction. 

Previous to the arrival of the squadron, the Bey had called the American consul to his presence, 
and, before the assembled divan, demanded the release of a Tunisian Xebec and her two prizes which 
had been captured by the Constitution for attempting to violate the blockade of Tripoli. The con- 
sul assured him that they would not be released, aird the Bey, with a frowir, threatened a declara- 
tion of war. He accordingly wrote a letter to commodore Rodgers, and in answer received a visit 
from his fleet as before stated. The Bey, up to the very day of the appearance of the squadron, had 
assumed a lofty tone of menace, and while his guards surrounded the coirsul with their drawn sci- 
metars and slackened bowstrings, addressed him as follows : 

" Ask any of the christian consuls in this regency if Hamouda Bashaw has ever received such an 
insult from their government 1 The President of the United States must know that my father and 
grandfather have sat on the throne and ruled a kingdom. He shall learn from me that Hamouda is 
not yet dead ; and every crowned head in Europe shall approve the eternal continuance of that war 
which you seem resolved to force me into — for I solemnly pledge myself, that if war is the result, 
never, while I have a soldier to fire a gun, will I accord peace. You may form some idea of my 
character from the difficulty you had to negociate a peace, because you weakly permitted the Dey 
of Algiers to interfere. You may also learn my conduct to the Venitians, who rashly forced me into 
a war ; and if I am doomed to engage in another, it shall be continued to the last hour of my ex- 
istence. I frankly tell you that the famine in my country has prevented my declaring war against 
•you, in order that I might convince my subjects that their miseries should not be increased, unless I 
was forced thereto. Without such a motive, you certainly never would have been asked the reason 
why you captured my vessels ; but that just motive to a protraction of our difficulties, must be sa- 
crificed to those considerations which I owe myself and all Europe. You are the first power which 
has ever captured a Tunisian cruizer in full peace, on any pretext whatever. You are the first that 
has ever offered unprovoked insults to Hamouda Bashaw, who has ruled a kingdom for twenty-seven 
years, and been respected by all the world as a'sovereign. If I were tamely to submit to such acts of 
outrage, what should I expect from nations far more powerful than yourselves 1 You have seen 
what has been accorded me by Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, whose local situation and maritime 
force must render them more formidable enemies than the United States. Abstracted from this, the 
measures pursued are such as do not permit me to enter into any negotiation. Your admirals have

done me great and repeated injuries, for the last of whicli my political existence forces me to insist 
on a proper reparation." 

At this moment a heavy cannon awoke the echoes of the palace, and, breathless with running, a 
Janizaiy entered the presence chamber. 

" Ha, Seliin," said the Bey, his curiosity getting the better of his dignity, "comes there a war 
ship from Stamboull" 

"Nay, most illustrious and magnificent piince, the christian dogs have entered tlie abode of hap- 
piness." 

" By my grandfather's beard," suid the Bey — for he could swear like a christian — " come, they 
with their single frigate to beard Hamnuda ! — let them retreat in time. Consul ! go to your admiral, 
and bid him not let the morning sun shine upon him by the ' Garden of the World,' or his head 
shall answer for his temerity." 

At this moment another Janizary came with the astounding news that the largest fleet ever be- 
fore Tunis. had anchored in the harbor, and that the signal for the "consul Americana" fluttered 
at the fore of the admiral. Hamouda Bey lost his tone of defiance in a moment. " Consul," said 
he, " remember me kindly to your admiral" — and, clapping his hands, bioke up the divan. 

The next morning captain Decatur was directed by the commodore to proceed to Tunis, and co- 
operate with the consul in obtaining from the Bey an unequivocal and satisfactory guarantee for the 
faithful observance of peace. The Bey, still excited, refused to receive captain Decatur in this cha- 
racter ; and the captain, in his usual spirited manner, " refused visiting him on any other tei'ms ;" 
and left Tunis to return to the squadron, and report the result of his mission. As soon as the Bey 
heard of his departure, he manifested great concern. His royal breast appeared to be panic-struck, 
and he despatched a messenger with a conciliatory letter with such expedition that it " was received 
on board the Constitution before captain Decatur came alongside." 

The next day a treaty was concluded between the most magnificent prince and the United States ; 
and the Congress, having received on board a Tunisian ambassador, the Constitution, followed by the 
squadron, got under weigh, and stood out of the harbor. 

As they passed the island of Goletta, the old frigate caught a glimpse of the American flag float- 
ing proudly in the breeze, and hoisted an ensign at the fore — then, as if by one simultaneous im- 
pulse, the star spangled banner ascended to the fore of every vessel in the squadron, and upwards 
of two hundred cannon woke their thunder-notes, while two thousand five hundred men raised 
the loud huzza. 

A faint echo came back upon the dying land-breeze, and " the abode of happiness" was lost from 
view. 



CRUIZE OFF TEXEL, AND DOWN THE CHANNEL. 

We hear nothing more of the old frigate until the close of the year 1811, when, under the com- 
mand of captain Isaac Hull, she left the United States for Holland, having on board specie for the 
payment of the interest of the natioiral debt. It was a wild night when she hove too off the Texel, 
and landed her rich freight ; and as her last boat left her, the English cruizers were seen hovering 
in the distance, and the seaman's halloo rang far over the stormy waters. 

At length the delicate aflair was finished, and she bore up for Plymouth, where she arrived after 
a boisterous passage. Here the spirit of impressment again reared its agitating form. While lying 
at anchor in the roads, a man jumped overboard, and swam with the tide to the British frigate Ma- 
dagascar, which vessel lay astern of the Constitution. The deserter was too much exhausted when 
first taken up to state his object, and the Englishman sent a boat to acquaint the commander of the 
Constitution that one of his men had been picked up by that ship while in a drowning condition. 
In the morning a cutter was sent from the Constitution to procure the man, but, upon reaching the 
Madagascar, the officer was informed that the man had claimed protection as an Englishman, and 
that he had been sent on board the guard ship. 

In the absence of captain Hull, Mr. Morris, the first lieutenant of the Constitution, sought an in- 
terview with sir Roger Curtis, the port admiral, and claimed the deserter. The admiral informed 
Mr. Morris that it was not in his power to give up a deserter ivJio claimed to be a Bi'itish subject. 
Mr, Morris asked the admiral if he had any evidence except the man's own word to satisfy him 
that he was an Englishman. 

" None whatever sir," said the swallow-tailed admiral ; " but we are obliged to believe him." 

The officer therefore returned on board his ship empty-handed. 

That night, as the evening gun died away over the silent waters, the Constitution's crew were 
mustered, and after a minute inspection, the watch was set, and extra sentinels posted, with posi- 
tive orders to fire at any thing that might be seen floating near the ship. About midnight all hands 
were roused by the hail of the sentinel, and the discharge of three muskets — and on inquiry, it was 
fou^d that there was a man in the water close alongside. A boat was immediately lowered, and,

upon its return, bi ought on board a seaman of the Madagascar's, who had contrived to buoy him- 
self up on some shells of blocks, and profiting by a turn of the tide, to drift down to the Constitu- 
tion. This man was asked what countryman he was, and he answered in a strong Irish accent, 
" An American, your honor." He was sent below, with orders to take good care of him. 

The next day the deserter was inquired after by the British commander, and it was intimated 
that as he had declared himself an American he could not be given up. It is believed, however, 
that no formal demand was made for the Irishman, though it was rumoured on shore that there 
would be trouble when the Constitution attempted to go to sea, as it was known that she was about 
to do that night. 

i In the course of the day two frigates came and anchored near her ; when, disliking his birth, the 
American commanding officer got under weigh, and dropped out about a mile to seaward. So close 
were the British ships at the time, that the pilot expressed his apprehension of getting foul of one of 
them — and he was told to go foul if he could do no better. By caieful handling, however, the ship 
went clear. A frigate followed the Constitution to her new anchorage. About 8 o'clock, captain 
Hull, who was now on board, ordered the ship cleared for action. The battle-lanterns were lighted 
fore and aft, and the crew went to their quarters by beat of drum. It is not easy to portray the en- 
thusiasm that existed in this noble ship ; every officer and man on board believing that the affair of 
the Chesapeake was about to be repeated — so fai, at least, as the assault was concerned. The man- 
ner in which the men took hold of the gun-tackles has been described as if they were about to jerk 
the guns through the ship's sides. An officer, who was passing through the batteiies, observed to 
the men that if there was an occasion to tight, it would be in their quarrel, and that he expected 
good service from them. 

" Let the quarter-deck look out for the colors, and we will look out for the guns," was the an- 
swer. 

In short, it was not possible for a ship's company to be in a better humor to defend the honor of 
the flag, when the drum beat the retreat, and the boatswain piped the men to the capstan bars. 
Home came the yielding anchor to the tune of Yankee Doodle — and the ship, casting to starboard, 
stood over to the French coast without a follower. Were the English frigates satisfied that the lion 
might be humbled in a single-handed attack with the gallant frigate 1 Perchance the echo of the 
tune that drowned the waihng of the dying soldiers at Bunker Hill, was still familial to their ears. 
Be this as it may, the noble stranger was permitted to bid the clifis of Dover good night alone. 

The next day, while beating across the channel, several sail of English men-of-war were seen in 
chase, and it was the impression on board the American ship that the vessels were sent in pursuit. 
The Constitution, however, outsailed all the strangers but one, a frigate, that weathered upon her. 
After leading this ship a long distance ahead of the others, captain Hull hove to, beat to quarters, 
and, beneath the flag that was so soon to wave in glory above her quarter-deck, awaited to know the 
stianger's object. It unfortunately proved amicable. On reaching the entrance of the port of Cher- 
bourg, the English vessel kept close to the American frigate — and while the latter was turning into 
the roads, with a fresh breeze and thick weather, bore up also. The private signal agreed upon be 
fore the Constitution left France, however, was not made, and the battery fired a gun. The shoi 
struck the Constitution in the bends. It was followed by a second, that flew between the masts. A 
third past through the hammock nettings, and stove one of the boats over ihe main hatch. The 
steadiness of the frigate now induced the French to pause ; and an opportunity offering soon after 
to display the signal, the Constitution glided into port, wlrile the English frigate hauled her wind, 
and made the best of her way to join the channel fleet. In this brush, a midshipman of the Con- 
stitution was killed by the wind of a shot. Thus did this old cruizer dash along the English chan- 
nel, bandy words, and give tit for tat to the British admiral beneath his thousand guns, and then re- 
turn to the United States to fire the first gun in the second war with the mistress of the sea.* 



THE CHASE. 

On the 12th of July, 1812, the frigate Constitution, under her former commander, captain Hull, 
having, on her return from Europe, shipped a new crew, sailed from Aimapolis on a cruize to the 
northward. On the 17th of July — on a Friday, be it remembered — while out of sight of land, though 
at no great distance from the coast, with a light breeze from the N. E., and under easy canvas, she 
made four sail to the northward, heading westward. At 3, P. M., while captain Hull and his officers 
were at dinner, the midshipman of the watch came down and reported that a squadron of men-of- 
war was in sight. 

" Mr. Morris beat to quarters," said the gallant commodore, as he repaired to his state-room to 
put on the symbols of his rank. 

* I have taken Cooper's note to his Naval History, as my guide in this chapter. 



OLD IRONSIDES. 141 

" Aye, aye, sir" — -and a wave of the hand, was all the reply that was made ; and soon the decks 
of the Constitution were in battle array. 

This was but five years after the one-sided action betweoi the Leopard and the ill-fated Chesa- 
peake — an action which covered the unhandsome conquerors with shame — an action based upon 
the misunderstanding of an order, and which the whole of the nations of Europe viewed with dis- 
gust and contempt. Disgust, that a captain of the British navy should have been found, in the 
eighteenth century, iUiberal and cowardly enough to attack an unofTending vessel in a time of peace ; 
and contempt that any American should have been found vile enough to justify it. Much injured 
Barron! Who can feel as you have felt for the neglect of others ! V/ho has suffered as you have 
for the faults even of Congress itself 1 Appointed to a half-fitted, ill-arranged ship, and ordered to 
sail at a moment's notice, with your decks lumbered with stores, witliout a powder-horn filled, or a 
match that could be lighted. Who, but dolts, under such circumstances, could have expected any 
other result than the unfortunate one which took place, in the placid waters of your own native 
state 1 No one could doubt you who had seen you standing at the gangway of your own ship, re- 
ceiving the fire of the enemy, while a friendly hail died upon your lips, and bathing your trumpet 
with your own blood. No one could censure you who had beheld you doubting the dishonor of 
the first naval power in the world — a power whose highest glory was national honor, and whose 
greatest zeal was to emulate the knights and heroes of old, whose helm.ets had flashed back the sun- 
beam upon the scorching plains of Syria, and whose battle-cry had ruHg in the cause of virtue along 
the crowded lists of enlightened E urope. It was a sight to call forth the disgust and contempt of a 
free-born nation ; aye, and of a world of fettered slaves. What ! the sons of Agincourt and Cressy ! 
of Poictiers and Calais! firing into an inoflfending vessel of a friendly power in her own waters, and 
under a friendly guise ! Heavens ! where were the nolo hosts of old — where the Drakes, the 
Kaleighs, to stay the dishonorable battle — where the Plantaganets and the Percys 1 No Black 
Prince ordered there — " no noble Essex — no immortal Blake" — but in their place ruled a little 
one — 

-with soul so small. 



That were it less, it were no soul at all." 

But to our subject ; the day of probation had passed av/ay — condemnation had been heaped upon 
the actors — the deed of shame had received its proper reward ; and the dim lion looked out upon 
the world of leaping waters, and cried in vain, " England is mistress of the sea." 

" Six bells," cried the orderly at the cabin door, as the Constitution tacked in nineteen fathoms 
water, and cleared off the shore. At 4, P. M., she discovered a fifth sail to the north-east, which 
had the appeal ance of a vessel of war. This ship subsequently proved to be the Guerriere, captain 
Dacres. By this time, the other vessels of the enemy were made out to be three ships and a brig ; 
they bore N. N. W., and were all upon the starboard tack, apparently in company. The wind now 
became light, and the heavy courses flapped idly against the mast. 

" Haul up the mainsail," thundered the first lieutenant, and away went the main wing of the fri- 
gate like a passing cloud. 

At 6, the ship in the eastern board had altered her position so as to bear E. N. E. — the wind hi- 
therto having been fair for her to close. At a quarter past 6, however, the wind came out light at 
the southward, bringing the American ship to windv;?ard. 

The old frigate, eager to take advantage, now wore round with her head to the eastward, set her 
light studding-sails and staysails — and at half-past 7, with drums beating, and matches lighted, bore 
down to speak the nearest vessel. The wind continued hght, and the two vessels were slowly closing 
until 8. At 10, the Constitution shortened sail, and made the private signal of the American 
cruizers. After keeping the lights aloft for nearly an hcur, and getting no answer, at a quarter past 
1 1 she lowered them, and made sail with her starboard tacks aboard. 

During the whole of the middle watch the wind was light, and irany a little knot of officers and 
men watched the dark hulls and gleaming sails of the pursuing fleet, as the moon-beam trickled 
upon them and the sleepy waters beyond, and then lost itself in a fleecy cloud. When the morning 
watch was called, a rocket shot up from the Guerriere, the foremost frigate, and sank in a blaze of 
stars upon the shadowy deep. As the day opened, three sail were discovered upon the starboard 
quarter, and three astern. At 5, A. M., a fourth vessel joined the latter, making seven vessels in 
chase. This was an anxious time — the squadron of commodore Broke was in pursuit, and Old 
Ironsides had nothing to depend upon but her silver heels. The nearest vessel was nearly within 
gun-shot, and a deep mist only concealed the object of the pursuers from their view. As the ships 
slowly varied their positions, and the mist cleared away, the Constitution perceived that she had two 
frigates on her lee quarter, and a ship of the line, two frigates, a brig, and a schooner astern. The 
chasers had English colors flying, and occasionally the thunder of a long eighteen would echo in 
the distance, and die away astern. It now became calm, and the frigate hoisted out her boats, and 
sent them ahead to tow, with a view to keep the ship out of the reach of the enemy's shot. At the 



142 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

same time she whipt up one of the gun-deck guns and run it out aft as a stern chaser, bringing a 
long eighteen from the forecastle for a similar purpose. Two twenty-fours were also run out of the 
cabin windows, though it was found necessary to cut away the wood-work of the stern-frame to 
make room. By 6, A-. M., the wind, which heretofore continued very light and bafHing, came out 
from the northward and westward, and knocked the ship ofl' with her head to the southward. All 
her light canvas that would draw was set. The Shannon now opened her fire upon the Constitu- 
tion — but perceiving that her shot fell short she ceased. At half-past 6, the frigate sounded in twen- 
ty-six fathom, and finding that the enemy was likely to close, from the circumstances of his having 
the boats of two ships to tow, and being favored by a little more air, she played out her spare rope, 
and sent out her cutters with a kedge nearly a mile ahead, and then let it go. At the woid, the bars 
were manned, and the old ship walked awaj', overrunning and tripping the kedge as she came up 
with the other end of the line. While this was doing, fresh lines and another kedge were carried 
ahead, and in this manner, though out of sight of land, the frigate had glided away from her pur- 
suers before they discovered the manner in which it was done. The greatest sluggards will awaken 
at last ; and thus we see the Shannon,^ after the chase had nearly left her by her towing, lower her 
boats, and follow the successful example. At half-past 7, the Constitution had a little air, when she 
ran up thCiOld thirteen, and fired a shot at the Shannon in token of defiance. At 8, however, it fell 
calm again, and further recourse was had to kcdging, the enemy's vessel having light air, and; draw- 
ing ahead. 

The Shannonwas now fast closing, and Old Ironsides was busily employed in preparing to give 
her visiter a warm reception. 

It was evidently the intentipnof -the English commander to cripple the Constitution by mems 
of the Shannon, and then to close upon her, and bear her down with mighty odds. A more despi- 
cable and cowardly plan never was conceived of by a naval commander. The Constitution bore 
down to engage the Guerriere — and she defied the Shannon. Why did not the British comman- 
der haul his wind, and let them have a bout 1 It was like a stag hunt ; and nobly did the flying 
frigate leave the 5'elling pack in the distance, to bay at the moon, or wake the ocean echoes with 
their thunder notes. Every thing on board of the chase was stoppered — the decks were sanded to 
dry up the expected torrent of blood — and hope beamed from the eyes of the officers, and was re- 
flected by the iron faces of the unequalled crew. 

Captain Hull was not without hopes, in case even of a meeting, of throwing the Shannon astern 
by his fire, and of maintaining a safe distance from the other vessels. It was known that the ene- 
my could not tow very near, as it would have been easy to sink his boats with the stern chasers of 
the Constitution, and not a man of the crew showed any disposition to despondency. 

" Kemember the Chesapeake," muttered the old captain of the gun. 

"Remember the Chesapeake," answered the powder boy at his heels. 

" Remember the Chesapeake," sang the man in the chains. 

And from the look-out aloft came down, in broken words, the same inspiriting battle-call. 

It was an hour of life or death — thank God, it was of life and glory. 



THE ESCAPE. 

Historian ! throw aside your record of the past, and tell me what shall be the result of this wea- 
risome chase. Man of prudence and safe calculation ! turn away and tell me the probable chances 
of safety by your unyielding figures. Thinking mariner ! retire to your cabin and tell me the pros- 
pect of the gallant frigate out-speeding the fast-sailing squadron that nearly encircles her. The 
winds of heaven, and the waves of ocean conspire against her. The flag of the republic clings like 
a wet sheet to her signal-halliards. The Shannon is fast closing with her astern, while the Guer- 
riere is swiftly bearing down upon her quarter. An hour promises to bring the struggle to an is- 
sue ; but hark ! there is a whisper in the clear heavens ; gentle voices seem to echo in the sky — a 
catspaw wrinkles the glassy waves, and now the ripple sings in the Constitution's wake. 

" A breeze," cries the drowsy look-out-man — the nodding seaman, worn out by long and arduous 
watching, springs up at the spiriting cry. 

" A breeze," thunders the ofiiicer of the deck, and soon the gallant ship is brought to the wind, 
with her sails trimmed, and her boats alongside. The quarter boats are run up to their davits, while 
the others are lifted clear of the water by purchases on the spare spars, where they swing ready to 
be used at a moment's notice. 

Onward she dashes in her majesty, the glorious stars of freedom proudly sparkling above her quar- 
ter deck ; but we must descend from the present to the past. The deed has been chronicled by the 
pen of the historian and the poet ; and the death-cry of one of the pursuers has long since ascended 
to the God of battles — while the loud huzzas of victory have wakened the echoes of the blood-tipped 
ocean from the Constitution's deck. 

As the frigate came by the wind she brought the Guerriere neatly on her lee beam, when that 



OLD IRON SIDE Si. 143 

vessel opened a fire from her broadside. While the shot were dimpling the water just beside them, 
the crew of the Constitution were securing their boats with the steadiness and regularity of an ad- 
miral's crew in port. In a short time, however, another calm settled upon the deep. It was now 
10 o'clock of the second day, and the labors of the first were about to be acted over again. Captain 
Hull now started two thousand gallons of water, and sent the boats ahead again to tow. The ene- 
my then sent all his boats to the Shannon, the nearest ship astern, and up came the lazy frigate 
upon the chase. A few hours of uncommon exertion followed — the crew of the Constitution being 
compelled to supply the place of numbers with activity and zeal ; and nobly did they do it. 

The ships were close by the wind; every thing that would diaw was set, and the Shannon was 
slowly but steadily stealing ahead. At noon, a light breeze carried the frigate clear, but shortly af- 
terwards the boats were again manned, and the toilsome work of towing and hedging was renewed 
again. 

At 1, P. M., the cry of " Sail 0," rang thiough the busy ship. Was she a friend or an enemy 1 
She was to the leeward, and could not be distinctly made out. At this moment, the four frigates of 
the enemy were about one point upon the lee quarter of the Constitution, at long gunshot distance, 
and the Africa and her two prizes were upon her lee beam. 

At a little past 2, the Belvidera, the nearest ship, began to fire with her bow guns, and the Consti- 
tution to answer with her stern chasers. On board the latter ship, however, it was soon found to be 
extremely dangerous to use the main-deck stern guns ; the transoms having so much rake, the win- 
dowsbeing so high, and the guns so short, that every explosion lifted the upper deck, and threatened 
to blow out the stern frame. Perceiving his shot did but little execution, and having fired a royal 
salute, double shotted, at the admiral, captain Hull ceased burning powder. 

For several hours the enemy's frigates were within gun-shot, sometimes towing and hedging, and 
at others endeavoring to close with the puffs that occasionally passed. 

At 7, the boats of the Constitution were again ahead the ship, steering S.W. half W. with a light 
air. At half-past 7, she sounded in twenty-four fathoms. 

Four hours now elapsed of the same toilsome duty ; but a little before 1 1, at night, a light wind 
struck the ship, and the sails, for the first time in many a wearj' hour, bellied to the breeze. The boats 
were immediately picked up, with the exception of the first cutter. Top-gallant, studding sails, and 
staysails were set, and for an hour the weary seamen slumbered at their guns. 

At midnight another calm ensued, and it was perceived that the GueiTiere gained upon the chase. 
At this time, the Constitution's top-gallant and studding sails were taken in. 

Morning at length came upon the ocean, and it was found that three of the enemy's frigates were 
within long gun-shot, on the lee quaiter, and the other at about the same distance on the lee beam ; 
the Africa and the prizes being much farther to leewarJ. The Guerrieie now tacked, when the 
Constitution did the same, to keep her windward position. Soon after, the vEolus passed on the 
contrary tack, so near that she might have materially damaged the Constitution had she opened 
upon her her fii-e. Captain Hull now hoisted in the first cutter, and set all sail. The scene was 
beautiful beyond description ; friends and foes looked on with admiration — and "War's red angel 
slumbered on his wings." The weather was mild and clear — the sea smooth and transparent as 
an inland lake — and the wind blew sufiiciently to do away with the everlasting kedging, which had 
continued, with but slight intermission, fi)r forty-eight hours. The coot danced upon the wave — 
the stormy petrel no longer whistled astern. From the far-offshore, the gray gull came screaming 
with delight, and the bald eagle hovered over the republican frigate — &lt;• The symbol of a mighty 
land." All the English vessels had got on the same tack with the Constitution, and the five frigates 
towered like moving mountains of snow upon the sleeping waters. Including the chase, eleven sail 
"were in sight ; shortly after, a twelfth appeared to windward. Captain Hull soon ascertained the 
stranger to be an American merchantman, and setting an Enghsh ensign, fired a gun to warn her 
to keep aloof; the hint was not overlooked, for soon the merchantman turned her cabin windows 
upon the belligerent squadron, and made a clean pair of heels for a more peaceful latitude. 

Until 10, A. M., the Constitution was making every preparation to carry a press of canvas, 
should it be found necessary. She now sounded in twenty-five fathoms. At noon, the wind died 
away again, but she had distanced the fleet. The Belvidera, however, was about two and a half 
miles off in her wake, bearing W.N.W. The nearest frigate to the leeward bore N. by W. half W. 
three and a half miles. The two other frigates were on the lee quarter, distant about five miles ; and 
the Africa was hull- down to leeward on the other tack. This was a vast improvement in the state 
of things, and officers and men were permitted to rest at quarters. 

At meridian, the wind began to blow a pleasant breeze — the water again rippled under the noble 
vessel's bows, and onward she dashed from her persevering pursuers like a Chesapeake pilot-boat 
before a north-easter. Her sails were watched and regulated in the most careful and seaman-like 
manner, imtil 4, P. M., when the Belvidera was four miles astern, and the other vessels thrown be- 
hind in the same proportion, notwithstanding the wind h;id become very light. 

In thisnianner both: parties pressed ahead and to windward as fast as circumstances would allow, 
profiting by every change of v.'ind and. tide, and resorting to every possible means of forcing theii 
vessels through the water. 



144 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

At 7, p. M., a black squall was seen rising ahead, and the Constitution prepared to meet it with 
the coolness and discretion displayed by her throughout this whole aflfair. All hands were at their 
stations, and every thing was kept fast until the last moment, when the order was given " Clew up 
and clew down" — in an incredible short space of time the light canvas was furled, a second reef 
taken in the mizen topsail, and the ship brought imder short sail. 

The English vessels, seeing her sudden movement, began to take in their canvas long before the 
squall reached them ; and when they were shut in by the rain, were seen steering wild upon the 
stormy sea. 

The Constitution, on the other hand, no sooner felt its weight than she hoisted and sheeted home 
hei fore and main top-gallant- sails; and while the enemy undoubtedly believed her to be a prey to 
the wind and the waves, she was flying away from them on an easy bow-line, at the rate of eleven 
knots an hour. 

In little less than an hour after the squall had struck the ship, it had entirely passed to leeward, 
and a sight was again obtained of the enemy. The Belvidera, the nearest vessel, had altered her 
bearing in that short period nearly two more points to leeward, and she was a long vi'aj' astern. 
The next nearest vessel was still farther to leeward, and more distant ; while the two remaining 
frigates were faiily hull down; the Afiicu was barely visible in the horizon. All apprehensions of 
the enemy now ceased, though sail was carried to increase the distance and to preserve the weather 
gage. 

At half-past 10, the wind backed farther to the southward, when the Constitution, which had been 
steering free for some time, look in her lower studding sails. 

At 11, the enemy fired two guns — and the nearest ship could just be discovered in the dim dis- 
tance. As the wind blew a soldier's breeze — viz : all around the compass — the enemy pei severed 
in the pursuit ; but when the day dawned, the nearest vessel was hull down astern, and to leeward. 
Under these circumstances, it was considered safe to use every exertion to lose sight of the enemy ; 
and the wind dying away, the Constitution's sails were wet down from the sky-sails to the courses. 
The good effects of this application was soon apparent, for at eight bells the topsails of the enemy 
began to dip. At a quarter past 8, the English ships hauled their wind to the northward and east- 
ward, fully satisfied in theii owm minds that, however much the members of the British parliament 
might affect to despise them, the fir-built frigates, decorated with bits of striped bunting, were man- 
ned by those who were fully equal, if not superior, to them in seamanship, and who, as the sequel 
will show, could triumph over them in the desperate struggle of naval war. 

The day after the enemy gave up the chase, the Constitution, under a press of canvas, entered 
the harbor of Boston; and with her yards manned, and her colors flying, saluted the city with se- 
venteen guns. 

Thus ended this extraordinary chase, which, for nearness of approach, overpowering numbers, 
and unmeasured exertion on the pait of the English; and for coolness, discretion, and wariness on 
the part of the pursued, never had been equalled in the world. Whether we look at the old ship 
kedging away from the Shannon, running down to speak the Guerriere, lifting her boats when the 
Lreeze freshened, oi running into the squall, and stripping herself with the swiftness of the wind ; 
whether we see her firing her gun of defiance, and beating to quarters in the face of eight ships of 
war, and then tacking with the Guerriere to keep to windward, and exposing herself to the fire of 
the ^olus ; we are equally filled with admiration and astonishment; and, with Dibdin, are almost 
constrained to say — 

" There's a sweet little Cherub that sits up aloft 
That keeps a look-out for poor Jack."

THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER 



B T EDGAR A . P O E , 



During the whole of a dull, daik, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds 
hang oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly 
dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within 
view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was— but, with the first glimpse of 
the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable ; for the feeling: 
was unrelieved by any of that hnlf-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind 
usually receives even the sternest nitural images of the des-jlate or terrible. I looked upon the scene 
before me — upon the meie house, and the simple landscape features of the domain — upon the bleak 
walls — upon the vacant eye-like windows — upon a few rank sedges — and upon a few white trunks 
of decayed trees — with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation 
■jmore properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium — the bitter lapse into common 
life — the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the 
heart — an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture 
into aught of the sublime. What was it — I paused to think — what was it that so unnerved me in 
the contemplation of the House of Usher 1 It was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could I grapple 
with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the 
unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural 
objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the reason, and the analysis, of this power, 
lie among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different ar- 
rangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to mo- 
dify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and, acting upon this idea, I rein- 
ed my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the 
dwelling, and gazed down — but with a shudder even more thriUing than before — upon the re-model- 
ied and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like 
windows. 

Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom 1 now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its 
proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood ; but many years had 
elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had ktel}' reached me in a distant part of the 
country — a letter from him — which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than 
a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily 
illness — of a pitiable mental idiosyuarasy which oppressed him — and of an earnest desire to see me, 
as his best, and indeed, his only persona! friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of 
my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, 
was said — it was the apparent heart that went with his request — which allowed me no room for he- 
sitation — and I accordingly obeyed, what I still considered a very singular summons, forthwith. 

Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. 
His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient 
family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, 
through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of mu- 
nificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even 
more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, 
the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, 
at no period, any enduring branch ; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of 
descent, and had always, with very tiifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was fhis defi- 
ciency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the pre- 
mises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence 
which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other — it was this de- 
ficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, 
of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original 
title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the " House of Usher" — an appellation

which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family 
mansion. 

I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment, of looldng down within the 
tarn, had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the conscious- 
ness of the rapid increase of my superstition — for why should I not so term it ? — served mainly to 
accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments 
having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted 
my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy — a 
fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which op- 
pressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that around about the whole 
mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity — 
an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the de- 
cayed trees, and the gray walls, and the silent tarn, in the form of an inelastic vapor or gas — dull, 
sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued. Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a 
dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be 
that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread 
the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from 
any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had falleir ; and there appeared to be a 
wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the utterly porous, and evidently 
decayed condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the spe- 
cious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years "in some neglected vault, with no 
disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, 
the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have dis- 
covered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made 
its way down the wall in a zig-zag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tain. 

Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my 
horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted 
me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. 
Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments 
of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me — while the carvings of the ceilings, 
the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial 
trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accus- 
tomed from my infancy — while I hesitated not to acknow-ledge how familiar was all this — I still 
wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one 
of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled 
expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. The 
valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master. 

The room in which I found myself was very large and excessively lofty. The windows were 
long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether 
inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trelliced 
panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye, how- 
ever, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and 
fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfort- 
less, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to 
give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, 
and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all. 

Upon my entrance. Usher arose from a sofa upon which he had been lying at full length, and 
greeted me widi a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought of an overdone cordial- 
ity — of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world. A glance, however, at his counte- 
nance convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down ; and for some moments, while he spoke 
not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so 
terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher ! It was with difficulty that I could 
bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boy- 
hood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of com- 
plexion ; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pal- 
lid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate Hebiew model, but with a breadth of 
nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, 
of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity ; these features, with 
an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not 
easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these fea- 
tures, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to 
whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now iriirarulous lustre of the eye, 
above all things stirtled and even a'.veJ me. The silken hair, too, had been suflered to grow all un- 
heeded, and as, in its wild gossami^r texture, it floated rather than fell about the fare, I could not, 
even with elToit, connect its arabooqus expressionwith any idea of simple humanity. 



THE HOUSE OF USHER. 147 

■In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence — an inconsistency ; and I 
soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trcpidancy, 
an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less 
by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his 
peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. 
His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in 
abeyance) to that species of energetic concision^^that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow^sound- 
ing enunciation — that leaden, self-balanced and pcTfi'ctly modulated guttural utterance, which may 
be observed in the moments, of the intensost excitement of the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable 
eater of opium. 

It.v/as thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the so- 
lace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the 
nature of his malady. It;was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he des- 
paired to find a remedy — a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubted- 
ly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of ithese, as he de- 
tailed them, interested and bewildered me^ — although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of 
the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses ; the most 
insipidfood was alone endurable ; he cquld wear only garments of certain texture ; the odois of all 
flowers.were oppressive ; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ; and there were but peculiar 
sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspiie him with horror. 

To.an anomalous species of terror I found him a boundeir slave. " I shall perish," said he, "I 
must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the 
events of /the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even 
the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, 
no abhorrence ofdanger, except in its absolute effect-^in terror. In this unnerved — ^in this pitiable 
conditiour-r-I feel that I must inevitably abandon life and reason together in my- struggles with some 
fatal demon of fear." 

I learn.ed, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature 
of his mental condition. He .was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the 
dwelling which he tenanted, and from which, for many years, he had never ventured forth — in re- 
gard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re- 
stated — an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, 
had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit — an effect which the physique of 
the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, 
brought about upon the morale of his existence. 

He admitted, however, although with hesita'ion, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus af- 
flicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin — to the severe and long- 
continued illness — indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution — of a tenderly beloved sister; his 
sole companion for long years — his last and only relay^e on earth. " Her decease," he said, with a 
bitterness which I can never forget, " would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of 
the ancient race of the Ushers." As he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed 
slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my piesence, disap- 
peared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread. Her figure, her air, 
her features — all, in their very minutest development were those — were identically (I can use no 
other sufficient term) were identically those of the Roderick Usher who sat beside me. A feeling of 
stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. As a dooi, at length, closed upon 
her exit, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother — but he had 
buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had 
overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears. 

The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, 
a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cata- 
leptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pres- 
sure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed ; but, on the closing in of the even- 
ing of my arrival at the house, she succumbed, as her brother told me at night with inexpressible 
agitation, to the prostrating power of the destroyer — .andd learned that the glimpse I had obtained 
of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain — that the lady, at least while living, 
would be seen by me no more. 

For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself; and, during this 
period, I was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted 
and read together — or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. 
And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of 
Ms spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which 
darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical 
universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom. 

I shall ever bear about me, as Moslemin their shrouds at Mecca, a memory of the many solemn

hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt 
to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved 
me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphurous lustre over 
all. His long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears. Among other things, I bear painfully 
in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von We- 
ber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, 
into'^vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why, 
from these paintings (vivid as there images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe 
more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the 
utter simpUcity, by the nakedness, of his de-igns, he arrested and over-awed attention. If ever mor- 
tal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least — in the circumstances then 
surrounding me — there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to 
throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the 
contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli. 

One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of ab- 
straction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior 
of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without 
interruption or device. Certairr accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that 
this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed 
in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible — 
yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate 
splendor. 

I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music into- 
lerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, 
the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great 
measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. Buc the fervid facility of his impromptus 
could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words 
of his wild fantasias, (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisa- 
tions,) the result of that intense mental coUectedness and concentration to which I have previously 
alluded as obser^able only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of 
one of these rhapsodies I have easily borne away in memory. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly im- 
pressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic currrent of its meaning, I fancied that I 
perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his 
lofty reason upon her throne. I'he verses, which were entitled " The Haunted Palace," lan very 
nearly, if not accurately, thus : 

I. 

In the greenest of our valleys, 

By good angels planted, 
Once a fair and statSy palace — 

Snow-white palace — reared its head. 
In the monarch Thought's dominion — 

It stood there ! 
Never seraph spread a pinion 

Over fabric half so fair. 



Banners yellow, glorious, golden. 

On its roof did float and flow ; 
(This — all this — was in the olden 

Time long ago) 
And every gentle air that dallied. 

In that sweet day. 
Along the ramparts plumed and palUd, 

A winged odoj^went away. 

rii. 

Wanderers in that happy valley 

Through two luminous windows saw -. i^ 
Spirits moving musically '\- 

To a lute's well-tuned law, 
Round about a throne, where sitting 

(Porphyrogene !) 
In state his glory well befitting. 

The sovereign of the realm was seen. 



THE HOUSE OF USHER. 149 

IV. 

And all with pearl and ruby glowing 

Was the fair palace door, 
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, 

And sparkling evermore, 
A troop of Echoes whose sole duty 

Was but to sing. 
In voices of surpassing beauty. 

The wit and wisdom of their king. 

T. 

But evil things, in robes of sorrow, 

Assailed the monarch's high estate •, 
(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow 

Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) 
And, round about his home, the glory 

That l)lushed and bloomed 
Is but a dim-remembered story 

Of the old time entombed. 

VI. 

And travellers now within that valley. 

Through the red-litten windows, see 
Vast forms that move fantastically 

To a discordant melody ; 
While, like a rapid ghastly river. 

Through the pale door, 
A hideous throng rush out forever. 

And laugh — but smile no more. 

I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein 
there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novel- 
ty, (for other men liave thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained 
it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his 
disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain con- 
ditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest 
abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with 
the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The condition of the sentience had been here, he 
imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones — in the order of their arrangement, 
as well as in that of the many fungi whicli overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood 
around — above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication 
in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence — the evidence of the sentience — was to be seen, he said, 
(and I here started as he spolie,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their 
own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet im- 
portunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and 
which made him what I now saw him — what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will 
make none. 

Our books — the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of 
the invalid — were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We 
pored together over such works as the Verveit et Chartreuse of Giesset ; the Belphegor of Machia- 
velli ; the Selenography of Brewster , the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg ; the Subterranean Voy- 
age of Nicholas Klimm de Holberg; the (Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean d'Indagine, and of 
De la Chambre ; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck ; and the City of the Sun of Cam- 
panella. One favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorium, by the 
Dominican Eymeric de Gironne ; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old Afri- 
can Satyrs and CEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, how- 
ever, was found in the earnest and repeated perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in 
quarto Gothic — the manual of a forgotten church — the Vigilae Mai-tuorum secundum Chorum Ec- 
clesiae Maguntinae. 

I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the 
hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no 
more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, previously to its final inter- 
ment, in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The wordly reason, 
however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. 
The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by considerations of the unusual charac- 



150 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

ter of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medi- 
cal men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial ground of the family. I will not 
deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair- 
case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but 
a harmless, and not by any means an unnatural precaution. 

At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entomb- 
ment. The body having been encoffined, \vc two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we 
placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive 
atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and utterly without means 
of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in 
which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for 
the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or other 
highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway 
through whithrwe reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had 
been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it 
moved qpon its hinges. 

Havirjg deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially 
turned alpide the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. The exact 
similitude between the brother and sister even here again startled and confounded me. Usher, di- 
vining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceas- 
ed and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always ex- 
isted between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead — for we could not regard 
her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as 
usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bo- 
som and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. 
We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with 
toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house. 

And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features 
of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations 
were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and ob- 
jectless step. The pallor of his countenanceliad assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue — but the 
luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard 
no more ; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. — 
There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with an op- 
pressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was ob- 
liged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, as I beheld him gazing upon va- 
cancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary 
sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified — that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, 
by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions. 

It was, most especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after 
the entombment of the lady Madeline, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep 
came not near my couch — while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the 
nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all of what I 
felt, was due to the phantasmagoric influence of the gloomy furniture of the room — of the dark and 
tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to 
and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were 
fruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame ; and, at length, there sat upon my 
very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this oflf with a gasp and a struggle, I 
upUfted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, 
barkened — I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me^to certain low and in- 
definite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. 
Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my 
clothes with haste, for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night, and endeavored to arouse 
myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the 
apartment. 

I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my 
attention. I presently recognized it as that of Usher. In an instant afterwards he rapped, with a 
gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His couirtenance was, as usual, cadaverously 
wan — but there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes — an evidently restrained hysteria in his 
whole demeanor. His air appalled me — but any thing was preferable to the solitude which I had so 
long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief. 

" And you have not seen it 1" he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments 
in silence — " you have not then seen it 1 — but, stay ! you shall." Thus speaking, and having care- 
fully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the gigantic casements, and threw it freely open to the 
storm. 



THE HOUSE OF USHER. 151 

The impetuous fury of the cnteiing gust nearly Ufted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a tem- 
pestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirl- 
wind hud apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations 
in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to 
press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-hke velocity with which 
they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I 
say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this — yet we had no glimpse of 
the moon or stars — nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of 
the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were 
glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which 
hung about and enshrouded the mansion. 

" You must not — you shall not behold this !" said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a 
gentle violence, from the window to a seat. " These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely 
electrical phenomena not uncommon — or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank 
miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement — the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. 
Here is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall listen — and so we will pass away 
this terrible night together." 

The antique volume which I had taken up was the " Mad Trist" of Sir Launcelot Canning — but 
I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest ; for, in truth, there is little in 
its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual 
ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand ; and I indulged a vague 
hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief (for the history of 
mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read» 
Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild, overstrained air of vivacity with which he barkened, or 
apparently barkened, to the words of the tale, I might have well congt*atulated myself upon the suc- 
cess of my design. 

I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, hav- 
ing sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good 
an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus — 

" And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on ac- 
count of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with 
the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his 
shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made 
quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand, and now pulling therewith stur- 
dily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding 
wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest." 

At the termination of this sentence I started, and, for a moment, paused ; for it appeared to me 
(although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) — it appeared to me that, from 
some very remote portion of the mansion or of its vicinity, there came, indistinctly, to my eais, what 
might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one cer- 
tainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which feir Launcelot had so particularly described^ 
It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for, amid the rattling 
of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, 
the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued 
the story. 

" But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed 
to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit ; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and pro- 
digious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of 
silver ; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten — 

Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin. 
Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win. 

And Ethelred upUfted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and 
gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred 
had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never 
before heard." 

Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement — for there could be no 
doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded 
I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual 
screaming or grating sound — the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up as 
the sound of the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer. 

Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coinci 
dence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, 
I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive ner-

TOusne»s of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question ; 
although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demean- 
or. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with 
his face to the door of the chamber, and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I 
;saw that that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his 
'breast — yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye, as I caught 
a glance of it in profile. The motion of his bod}', too, was at variance with this idea — for he rock- 
-sd from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of 
all -this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded : — 

" And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking him- 
self of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed 
the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of 
;4he castle to where the shield was upon the wall ; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but 
fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound." 

No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than — as if a shield of .brass had indeed, at the mo- 
ment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver — I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clang- 
orous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I started convulsively to my feet, 
but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he 
sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance their reigned a 
.■more than stony rigidity. But, as I laid my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder 
over his frame ; a sickly smile quivered about his lips ; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and 
gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over his person, I at length 
drank in the hideous import of his words. 

" Not hear it ? — yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long — long — long — many minutes, many 
liours, many days, have I heard it — yet I dared not — oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am ! — I 
dared not — I dared not speak ! We have put her living in the tomh ! Said I not that my senses 
•were acute 1 — I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard 
them — many, many days ago — yet I dared not — I dared not speak ! And now — to-night — Ethel- 
jared — ha ! ha ! — the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor 
•of the shield — say, rather, the rending of the coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges, and her 
struggles within the coppered archway of the vault ! Oh whither shall I fly ? Will she not be 
here anon 1 Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste ? Have I not heard her footsteps on 
the stair % Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart 1 Madman !" — here 
lie sprung violently to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up 
liis soul — " Madman I I tell you that she now stands without the door /" 

As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell — 
the huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their 
ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust — but then without those doors there 
did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon 
her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame, 
.Por a moment she remained tiembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold — then, with a low 
i£noaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her horrible and now final 
i death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had dreaded. 

From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was still abroad in all its 
wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, 
and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued — for the vast house and its sha- 
dows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which 
now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken, as 
extending from the roof of the building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this 
lissure rapidly widened — there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind — the entire orb of the satellite 
burst at once upon my sight — my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder — there 
was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters — and the deep and dank 
■^am at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the " House of Usher"

DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY THE NORTHMEN 

IN THE TENTH CENTURY. 

BT HALI GRANDGENT, PHILADELPHIA. 



"We suppose that many persons will be greatly mortified to learn that America was discovered as 
early as the tenth century, which is several centuries previous to its discovery by Columbua\ His 
tame is held so sacred by a large portion of mankind that obstacles are thrown in the way of any at- 
tempt to prove that it was visited long before his biith. 

We by no means wish to lessen the glory acquired by Columbus in his perilous voyage; for we 
have no reason to suppose that he availed himself of any information respecting the prior discovery. 
It is true that he visited Iceland in the early part of his life, and it is probable that he made himself 
acquainted with the western discoveries of the Northmen. But his own famous voyage was made 
in quest of India ; and that he had no reason to suppose them to have discovered the land he was in 
search of, is sufficiently apparent from his never having mentioned their discoveries to the sovereigns 
whose patronage he sought. Had he thought this to be the case, he could have told the sovereigns 
who considered his scheme as visionary, that the country had already been discovered by the North- 
men ; and that he, having visited Iceland in his youth, had made himself perfectly acquainted with 
their discoveries, and had no doubt, in his own mind, of being able to reach this country. This 
would have been the most powerful motive he could have brought forward for making the attempt; 
and it is very probable, had he mentioned it to any of the sovereigns by whom his proposal was re- 
jected, that they, having proof that there really existed a country in the west, would have immediately 
lent him their assistance for the advancement of his design. 

But we have every reason to suppose that America might have been discovered by the Northmen, 
®ven if there were no records to prove it. These people, who were natives of Norway, Sweden, Den- 
IQark, and some of the other northern countries of Europe, were the great navigators of their age. 
Their fleets covered most of the seas by which Europe is surrounded ; they had made conquests in 
Scotland, England, and some other countries, and some of their vessels had sailed through the strait 
of Gibraltar, visited Marseilles in the reign of the emperor Charlemagne, and spread over the whole 
coast of the Mediterranean. That they discovered and colonized Iceland and Greenland before the 
period of their alleged discovery of America, is a matter of undoubted history. Now there is no reason 
to suppose that the Northmen, who had sailed so far as the Mediterreaneaa, would have hesitated to 
cross the strait which separated Greenland from America, being only about two hundred miles in 
breadth. 

Having finished these preliminary observations, we will now give a brief account of the voyages 
made to America by the Northmen in the tenth century. We derive our information on this sub- 
ject principally from a work entitled " Antiquitates Americanae," which has recently been pubUshed 
by the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen, a society that has devoted itself to the 
task of rescuing from oblivion the accounts of the early discoveries of the Northmen, which have re- 
mained in the hands of the Icelanders, who had made a respectable progress in literature at the peiiod 
of the discovery, and are known to have maintained a high literary character ever since. The records 
thus preserved by the Icelanders have always been respected by them as authentic, and have pre- 
cisely the same degree of authority with their other national records. They have been comparatively 
neglected by the historians of the south of Europe from a variety of causes, among which it is suffi- 
cient to enumerate the isolated condition of the Icelanders, their small intercourse with the rest of 
Europe, the difficulty of their language, the want of inclination among the historians to publish any 
thing that would derogate from the fame acquired by Columbus, and more than all from the claim 
of the Icelanders to the discovery of America having been confounded with other claims which had 
really no foundation in truth. 

It appears from these Icelandic records as well as from some others which have been coasidered as 
authentic, that the Northmen, who still maintained their enterprising character, shortly after their 
discovery of Iceland, visited Greenland by crossing a narrow strait of one hundred and fifty-eight 
miles in width, and formed settlements on its western coast. The remains of these settlements, such 
as houses, churches, etc., are visible at the present day. Voyages were now not unfrequently made 
from Iceland to Greenland, in the course of one of which, the ship was carried by contrary winds to 
the coast of Labrador. This fact is thus narrated by their historians. 



154 burton's gentleman's biagazine. 

Among the persons who followed Eiic the Eed to Greenland, in 986, was Heriulf Bardson, who 
established himself at Heriulfsnes. He had a son, named Biarne, who at that time was on a distant 
trading voyage ; having finished his business, ho retm^ned to Iceland, but finding that his father had 
departed for Greenland, he resolved to go and seek him. He set sail, but encountered northerly 
winds, by which he was carried from his course, and knew not where he was. When the weather 
cleared up, he saw a land covered with wood, and having many small hills upon it. As this land did 
not correspond with the description of Greenland, he continued sailing for some time, when he again 
discovered land the appearance of which was similar to the oiuer. He again stood out to sea, and in 
a few days arrived safely at Heriulfsnes in Greenland. 

In the 3'ear 994, Biarne visited Eric, earl of Norway, and told him of the lands he had discovered. 
He then returned to Greenland and sold his ship to Leif, a son of Eric, who manned it with thirty- 
five men. They began their voyage in the year 1000, and first discovered the land which Biarne 
had last seen. They cast their anchors and went on shore to seek for some vegetables ; but finding 
none, and the shore being covered with slate, they named it Hellu-Land, (Slate Land.) They again 
set sail, and discovered another shore, on which they also landed. The country was level and covered 
with woods; and they therefore called it Markland, (Woodland.) They sailed from this island in a 
northeasterly direction, and in two days came again in sight of land. They passed an island which 
lay east of the mainland, and went on shore at the mouth of a river. They brought the ship through 
t^e river into the lake in which it rose, where they cast anchor. Determining to pass the winter 
there, they constructed themselves se'ceral large houses. After they were finished, Leif divided his 
men into tvs'o paities, one of which was to remain to guard the houses, while the other made small 
incursions into the country ; he had ordered this party to go no farther than that they could return 
in the course of the evening of the same day. One day, a German, named Tyrkir, was missing. 
Leif with a small party went in search of him ; but they had not gone far before they met him coming 
towards them. Leif inquired where he had been. He answered : " I did not go much farther, yet 
I have a discovery to acquaint you with ; I have found vines and grapes." The party had now two 
occupations, viz., to hew timber for loading the ship, and to gather grapes. With these last they 
loaded the ship's long boat. They called this country Vinland, (Vineland,) on account of the vines 
which they found there. In the spring they set sail, and arrived safe at Greenland. 

After Leifs return to Greenland, his voyage to Vineland became a subject of frequent conversa- 
tion. Thorwald, his brother, thinking the country had not been sufficiently explored, resolved to 
pay it a visit. He accordingly borrowed Leif's ship, and set sail in 1002. He arrived at Leifsbooth 
in Vineland, where he passed the winter. In the next spring, he sent a small paity in the ship's 
long boat on a voyage of discovery southwards. The country was very beautiful ; but they could 
discover no traces of men, excepting on a small island to the westward, where they found a wooden 
shed. They did not return until fall. Thorwald left this place in the summer of 1004, and passed 
a headland which, from its form, he called Kial-ar-nes, (Keel Cape.) They then sailed along the 
eastern coast of the island to a promontory where they landed. When about to go on board they 
discovered three hillocks, and on going to them, they found three canoes, under each of which were 
three Esquimaux ; they killed eight of them, but the ninth made his escape. He returned with a 
great multitude of his countrymen from the interior of the hay. The Esquimaux discharged their 
arrows at the Europeans for some time and then retired. Thorwald was mortally wounded with one 
of their anovvs, and feehng that he could not long survive, he charged his companions to bury him 
on the promontory, with a cross at his head, and another at his feet, and to call the place Kioss-a- 
ness, (Cross Cape.) They did as he had ordered them, and passed the winter there ; in the spring 
they returned to Greenland, and gave an account of their voyage to Leif. 

Thorstein, Eric's third son, in attempting to proceed to Vineland to bring away his brother's body, 
was tossed about upon the ocean during the whole summer, and knew not where he was driven : but 
early in the winter, he landed at one of the western settlements of Greenland, where he died. His 
wife, Gudrida, who had accompanied him in this voyage, returned to Ericsford the following spring. 

In the summer of 1006, there arrived in Greenland two ships from Iceland ; one was commanded 
by Karlsefue, the other by Biarne Grimolfson and Thorhall Gamlason. During the winter Karlsefue 
was marTied to Gudrida. In the following spring an expedition was fitted out, consisting of three 
ships and one hundred and sixty men. They first landed at Hellu-Land, and two days afterwards 
they came to Markland, a country covered with woods. Leaving this, and sailing in a southwesterly 
direction, they came to Kial-ar-nes, which was covered with sands and trackless deserts. Going 
forward they found several inlets. There were two Scots among the party, who were very swift of 
foot. These were put on shore and told to proceed in a southwest direction. After the lapse of 
three days they returned, bringing with them some grapes and ears of wheat. They then continued 
their course till they came to a firth at the mouth of which was an island, past which there ran strong 
currents. This land they called Straum-ey, (Stream Isle,) and the firth Straum-Fiordr, (Stream 
Firth.) Thorhall and eight men, now went towards the north, in search of Vineland, but were 
driven by westerly winds on the coast of Iceland, where they were seized and treated as slaves. The 
rest of the company sailed southwards, and arrived at a place where a river, rising in a lake, empties 
into the sea. At the mouth of the river were several large islands. They steered into the lake and

called tlie place H op. One morning they saw a large number of the natives approaching in canoes. 
These people were very sallow and ill-looking. After gazing at the ship a short time, they rowed 
away to the southwest. Karlsefue and his company erected their dwellings near the bay, where 
they passed the winter. They were early one morning again surprised by some of the natives, who 
immediately fell to trading with them. While the trade was going on, a bull belonging to Karlsefue 
came out of the woods and bellowed loudly. On hearing this, the natives rushed into their boats and 
rowed swiftly away. In the following winter, the natives again came in great numbers, and showed 
signs of hostility. Karlsefue advanced against them, and a battle ensued. The natives had a sort of 
sling with which they discharged huge stones among Karlsefue's people, who became terrified, and 
fled in all directions. Freydisa, a natural daughter of Eric, who was with them, cried out : " How 
can stout men like you fly from these miserable caitiffs, whom I thought you could knock down like 
cattle ! If I had only a weapon, I ween I could fight better than you !" They did not listen to her 
words, ])ut continued their flight. She endeavored to keep up with them but was not able ; she, 
however, followed them into the woods, where she found the dead body of Thorbrand Snorrason, 
whose sword was lying by his side. This she picked up, and, uncovering her breast, struck it with 
the naked sword. At this sight the natives became terrified and fled to their canoes. Karlsefue 
now determined to leave this country, and having left part of his crew at Vineland, he sailed towards 
Greenland : on his way thither he stopped at Markland, where he met with five Esquimaux. The 
crew seized two of them, (boys,) whom they carried with them to Ericsford, in Greenland, where 
they arrived in safety. 

In the summer of 1011 another voyage was fitted out for Vineland. The ship belonged to two 
brothers, Helge and Finuboge, who entered into the agreement with Freydisa, that they should share 
equally all the profits with her. A coldness arose between them and Freydisa, owing to her having 
introduced more men into the ship than was agreed upon ; and a short time after, Freydisa prevailed 
on her husband to massacre the two brothers and their followers. After the perpetration of this base 
deed they returned to Greenland about the time that Karlsefue was ready to sail for Norway, (1013.) 
He set sail, spent the following winter there, and in 1014 went to Iceland, where he purchased an 
estate, on which he resided during the remainder of his life. A numerous and illustrious family 
descended from him, among whom we may mention the bishop Thoriak Eunolfson. It is probable 
that the account of the voyages here mentioned was originally compiled by him . 

The particular places discovered and visited by the Northmen have been satisfactorily ascertained. 
Hellu-Land is the same with Newfoundland; Markland, with Nova Scotia. Vinland is Nantucket; 
Kialarnes, Cape Cod; The Straum Fiordr, Buzzards Bay. Straum-ey is, Martha's Vineyard; 
Kross-a-ncss, Gurnet Point ; and H op, the country through which the Taunton river flows. 
fit Such were the discoveries and settlements of the Northmen in America in the tenth and eleventh 
centuries. They were at first driven there by accident ; but afterwards repeatedly visited it, and 
formed several settlements on the coast. The question may now arise, if there were, really colonies 
in x\merica, why were they abandoned 1 We say in the first place, that they were abandoned be- 
cause the colonies in Greenland, from which they received their supplies of food, clothing, etc., were 
abandoned ; and secondly, because the Northmen had settled themselves in the southern parts of 
Europe, and now, being in a better country, they felt no inclination to hazard such distant and 
dangerous voyages, since they had not the aid of the mariner's compass, which was not invented till 
some centuries after these events had taken place. 



THE SUMMER MOON 



BT CHARIES WEST T H O M S O N" , 



The bright moon of summer looks down from the 
sky. 
And sleeps silently on thro' the regions of night ; 
And while we pursue her still course upon 
high. 
We deem it the pathway of glory and light. 
And the scenes that she smiles on, illum'd by her 
ray, 
Look fairer than when they were touch'd by the 
sun. 
And come to the heart with a lovelier sway, 
Than in day's full effulgence they ever had done. 



But the smile that enchants, and the glory that 
beams, 
With a lustre more pure, and a radiance more 
bright. 
Is the sunshine of worth that unfadingly gleams, 

Where Beauty and Virtue together unite. 
The moon will look forth when the tempest is gone, 
And the clouds that obscured her, have vanished 
away — 
But Virtue's pure ray shines unceasingly on. 
With a light that no cloud and no tempest can 
sway.

Though now this grained face of mine be hid 
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow, 
And all the conduits of my life froze up ; 
Yet hath my night of life some memory, 
My wasting lamp some fading glimmer kft. 

Shakspearet 

Out upon time ! it will leave no more 

Of the things to come than the things before ! 

Out upon time ! who for ever will leave 

But enough of the past for the future to grieve 

O'er that which hath been, and o'er that which must be : 

What we have seen, our sons shall see ; 

Remnants of things that have passed away, 

Fragments of stone reared by creatures of clay. 

Byren, 



Nothing annoys me, in my enforced removal from the home of my childhood, so much as the 
dilapidated state of an old bureau, which is positively too shattered by the knocks of " the scythe 
aaan" to admit the possibility of another transplantation in a state of entirety. It is indeed a vene™ 
rable relic, and has been the repository of the secrets of our family for a century of twelvemonths. 
My father's parent, the formal dispenser of colonial law, secured in one of its secret drawers his pa- 
tent of appointment, graced with the kingly signature of the second George. My father placed 
■within its pigeon holes the sage records of his comrades, the rebellious colonists, who threw off the 
foul yoke of dependance upon the magnates of a distant land, and gave liberty to their fellow men» 

I love this antique piece of furniture Uke a thing of positive life. It has been an old friend to me, 
in whose bosom I have deposited many a strange matter ; and the withdrawal of its contents will 
bring back the recollection of bye-gone days, with all their burning thoughts, and the exploded chi- 
meras of that false prophet, hope. I shall again behold, in my mind's eye, the old familiar faces of 
my buried friends — and foes. I shall again live over the painful events of my long, long life, and 
open the sluices «f my age-clogged, tide-worn heart — for there are some few matters in the recesses 
of that old bureau which I cannot leave to be desecrated by the workman's touch. 

How the rust has eaten into the works of the lock, and destroyed the action of the hinges ! the 
corroding sand of old Chronos spares neither man nor metal. Now, the strangely-mixed contents 
of the bureau are before me. The topmost letter of this pile reminds me of a painful but salutary 
lesson taught me in my earliest manhood. It is a cold and caustic acknowledgment of a written 
apology which my stern but honest parent insisted that I should send to a young lady, who, having 
refused my addresses, had been subsequently slightly spoken of by me, in the silliness of my revenge. 
My apology, ample in its regrets and confessions, was published at my father's express desire. — 
" Scandal," said he, " is the living emblem of a low and narrow mind. Its practice depraves the 
heart and degrades the man." I have never forgotten the sterling beauty of that simple truth. 

This golden toy — this gaudily-embossed box — was presented to me by various of my fellow citi- 
zens, as an acknowledgment of my services in obtaining from the state-government, a charter for an 
institution which lasted but a year or two, and resulted in heavy mortification and pecuniary loss. 
This establishment was to afford invaluable blessings to society — at least, so said the prospectus, and 
the members of the state legislature had the phrase stereotyped for general use, Every trace of its 
existence has passed away, excepting the dull inscription on the lid of my presented box. 

In the golden interior of this box, a fitting coffer for a priceless relic, lies a ringlet of a lady's hair. 



A RUMMAGE IN MY OLD BUREAU. 157 

It belonged to my affianced — nay, my wedded bride. She was the chosen object of my heart's best 
love, and beautiful as the highest-wrought imaginings of a young lover could desire. On the mom~ 
ing of our wedding day, we embarked on board a sloop bound for her father's residence on the Hud- 
son's bank. There were no steamboats then, to render positive the certainty of a safe and speedy 
trip ; the slow craft worked its devious way along the windings of the river, and was unable, if the 
wind lulled, to'stem the downward current of the mountain stream. On this day, the day of my 
wedded bliss, I cared not for the dull drifting of our sloop ; my young wife stood upon the smalt 
deck of the vessel, and leaircd her head upon my shoulder, as I pointed out to her the various scenfe 
beauties of the water and the wold. A puff of wind gushed down the hill side, and rippled the 
river's face. It was the breath of God, and spoke of death. The sloop was blown upon its beam 
ends, and we were precipitated into the stream. A spar struck my bride upon her head — she sunk 
almost within my grasp. Hours elapsed before her corse was given to my care. I received my 
young and lovely wife, with the slime of the river's bed upon her bridal vestments ; her beauteous^ 
face was disfigured by the death blow, and the marks of the foul drag-hook were imprinted on her 
limbs. I kissed hsr honey lips, and cutting a ringlet from her blood-stained brow, consigned her t* 
the grave's fast keep. Three score and ten winters have shed their snows since my widowed heart 
grieved at the death of its mistress — other tics and affections have occupied my mind, and I have 
subsequently known the pangs of v^'o in all its thousand grades — but never felt an agony to equal- 
that with which I mourned my virgin bride's decease. 

* * « * * * * 

Ha ! here is the honored autograph of V/ashington appended to a letter, thanking me for the ex- 
ecution of certain orders entrusted to my care, during the perilous times of the war-doings in Penn- 
sylvania. I well remember the pride with which I handed the memorial of my well-doing to my 
brother officers, and the hearty nature of their honest congratulations. I rode thirty miles to exhibit' 
my beloved chief's commendation to my venerable parents; the snow was on the ground, and the- 
enemy's videttes scoured the line of country through which I passed. But I defied all difficulties,, 
and with a light heart and a trusty steed, achieved the end of my journey in safety. Ah ! even- 
now, methinks I see the tears that coursed down the furrows in my mother's cheeks, as she listened' 
to my recital of (he dangers I had overcome. Methinks I feel the firm pressure of my father's hand, 
as, with a trembling voice, he read alovtd the commendations of our country's warrior, and exulted; 
in the praises bestowed upon his patriot boy ! 

How confusedly the mementos of the past incidents of life present themselves to notice ! Here' 
are two letters of invitation from persons of extremest opposition — the small envelope contains s 
note on delicate tinted paper from Mrs. Madison, politely requesting my late wife to honor the Pre- 
sident's soirees with her presence. It would be difficult to conceive a greater perfection of enjoyment 
than that afforded by those elegant assemblies. The other letter, bulky and burly, is in the hand- 
writing of Knyphausen, the general of the Hessian force, which, adjunctive to the British, occupied 
Philadelphia in 1777-8. The conductors of the celebiated Meschianza, a fete given by the officers 
of the British army to their commander-in-chief. Sir William Howe, previous to the surrender of his- 
authority into the hands of Sir Henry Clinton, had invited the principal belles of the city to partake 
the mumming glories of the carnival-like procession and display. To the shanre of the sex be it 
said, that many of the daughters of the first families in Philadelphia were unable to resist the temp- 
tation, and, donning romantic and stage-made dresses, joined the enemies of their country in doing 
homage to the hostile chief, who then held violent possession of our native city. My sister, a lovely- 
girl, some ten j'ears younger than myself, had attracted the attentions of more than one of the gal- 
lant officers belonging to the Biitish force. General Knyphausen, who, from his politeness to the- 
American citizens, had made himself a favorite in all circles, addressed to my sister a pressing invi^ 
tation to become one of " the Fair Damsels of the Blended Rose," who, in foreign attire, were to 
preside over the destinies of the combatants in the tilt or tourney. The General also requested per- 
mission to dedicate his sword to her beauty, and be recognised as her champion in the fight. My 
sister, unadvised, returned the General's letter with a polite assurance that he must have misdirected' 
it ; it was impossible that he could imagine her so basely-minded as to bend the knee submissively 
to him who was hostilely ravaging her native land, or wish success even to the sportive efforts of the- 
sword which had been raised against the lives of her dearest friends. Knyphausen's answer is be- 
fore me. He gallantly compliments the lady's patriotism, but laments the severity of its practice,, 
although he acknowledges the correctness of her reasoning. 

The son of this same Knyphausen excited the laughter of the European magnates by assuming, 
at the congress of sovereigns at Aix-la-Chapelle, the airs and state of an independent prince. The 
name of Knyphausen, or Kniephausen, is derived from a small castle in a German duchy ; some 
half dozen houses and about fifty inhabitants, comprise the feudalities of this petty lordship ; the- 
title of which is now in abeyance, by order of the German diet, in consequence of the late owner 

having joined the Holy Alliance.

In the centre compartment of the old bureau is a drinking cup formed of the skull of a New Zea- 
and warrior, and presented to me by my son, as the only thing rescued from the insatiate waves 



158 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

when shipwrecked on a reef off the Florida Keys. The gallant vessel, with all its world of wealth, 
sunk to the bottom, and gave forth no portion of its riches to the survivors of the desolate and help- 
less crew ; who, by the boat's help, had clustered on a small but rocky island, and wondered to what 
end their lives had been preserved. After two days and nights of hunger and suspense, they were 
relieved by the rough humanity of a Gulf wrecker, v/ho freighted his rickety bark with a cargo of 
destitute sailors, from whom it was impossible to obtain either payment or reward. But the old fel- 
low gave up his stores to the starving mariners, and succeeded in landing them in safety at Havana. 
As my son was quitting the reef, he observed the skull cup in one of the clefts of a rock, by the wa- 
ter side, wherein it had been driven by the action of the waves. He picked up the only available 
token of the wreck, and preserved it during his passage home. It had been a choice utensil with 
the drowned captain of the wrecked vessel, who used to declare that he had seen the body of the 
■owner of the skull devoured by his conquerors, the inhabitants of a South Sea Island. He, the cap- 
tain, had made the usual conciliatory piesents to the chief of the cannibals, and, in return, received 
the cranium of the latest victim, as a token of peace and good will. 

The cup, or skull, contains a strange assemblage of articles : they are the unwritten pages of my 
son's life — and death. He was my only child. I wedded his mother at an age when the passions 
of youth no longer exercise despotic sway. But I loved her with a tenderness that ensured felicity. 
We adored our child with a reverence scarcely human ; his early fate broke his mother's heart — she 
died, clasping this locket which contains a curl of his golden hair, cut on the first arniiversary of his 
birth. 

Here is a silver chain and boatswain's whistle ; it was the gift of a grateful sailor whose life had 
been saved by my son, then a midshipman aboard one of the frigates forming part of the first Ame- 
rrican squadron, which put to sea three days after the declaration of war between Great Britain and 
the United States, in June, 1812. During a heavy squall, a boatswain's mate fell overboard; my 
son, catching one of the sheets in his grasp, jumped over the ship's side with such celerity that he 
had firm hold of the man before he entered the vessel's wake. Whilst swimming towards the sailor, 
my son twisted the end of the rope round his left arm ; there was considerable way on the frigate, 
and when the rope had run out its length, the force and suddenness of the shock broke my boy's 
;arm — but he held on to the sinking man, and, when the vessel was hove to, they were hoisted aboard ; 
the vuate senseless, and my son with his broken limb hanging useless by his side. 

The SL^man soon recovered, and his gratitude towards the preserver of his life exhibited itself in 
positive devoticn to his welfare. A few weeks' confinement was necessary to the well-knitting of 
the broken bone ; til? boatswain's mate attended his patient with unremitting assiduity and kindness. 
The heroic nature of tti? act, and the quiet endurance of the agony which necessarily accompanied 
the continued strain upon the fractured Umb, rendered the young midshipman a favorite both with 
the ofiicers and men. His bravery was afterwards exhibited in one of the severe conflicts which 
have placed the name of the frigate on a conspicuous page of our naval history. He returned to 
port with the reputation of a hero, ana participated largely in the compliments bestowed upon the 
defenders of the stars and the stripes. 

The boatswain's mate, obtaining a few days' leave of absence, journeyed from Boston to Phila- 
delphia, for the purpose of easing his grateful heart by detailing to the parents of his preserver the 
means of his deliverance from a sea grave. Methinks, even now, I see the rough sailor recapitula- 
ting to his delighted auditors the minute particulars of the fall and rescue. His thick bushy whisk- 
ers encircled a dark weather-beaten face ; his sailor's shirt appeared in thick folds between his jacket 
and trousers ; a small tarpaulin hat was placed beneath his chair ; his conversation was interlarded 
with sea slang and horrible oaths, and he squirted tobacco juice over the bright dog irons and polish- 
ed mantel-sides. Yet a more welcome visiter never sat upon our hearth — for he talked, with love 
and reverence, of our darling son. 

When he rose to depart, I pressed on him the hospitalities of the night, but in vain. His purpose 
was accomplished, and he started instantly on his return to his ship. I offered him some pecuniary 
assistance on his journey ; his small eyes glittered as he answered — 

" No, no, master. I made sail here to tell you what I knew your son wouldn't tell himself. I 
know'd that it was impossible that the parents of sich a ship-shape craft as he couldn't do no less 
nor love him, and I wanted you to larn as he was worth loving. I didn't want to make your num- 
ber for the sake of a supply of beef and biskit, but I didn't object to a can of flip with the father of 
Mm as saved my life. Good bye, ma'am. Don't you be afraid of your son's safety ; he's got me 
to look arter him now, and I means to keep atween him and ill-luck, if it fall's in my watch. I han t 
got nothing worth your having as a keepsake from me, ma'am, except my chain and whistle. Please 
keep it, to think of him what loves your son as much as you do. I can get another from the purser. 
So saying, he threw his only ornament around the neck of my wife, and, with a low bow, and a 
hitch at his trousers, started for the door. 

At one of the fetes given in honor of the frigate's victory, my son danced with a young lady, the 
daughter of one of the chiefest merchants in New York. She was lively, handsome, and fascina- 
ting, and soon enchained her partner in her toils. Proud of her captive, she lent a ready ear to his 
fond asseverations, and in a few days, I received intelligence of their marriage. The news struck 



A RUMMAGE IN MY OLD BUREAU. 159 

me as with a blight : I had no fault to find with the object of his choice, for she was rich, well-born, 
and highly educated — but I dreaded evil, thoui^h I knew not why. I leprehended my son for his 
hasty proceeding — for not consulting with his patents, or even acquainting thorn with his intentions 
till they had been effected. He pleaded haste — the force of love — the dread of being ordered in- 
stantly to sea — and the probability of losing the object of his affections. His doting mother accord- 
ed him her forgiveness, and interceded with me in his behalf. In a few days, the young husband 
and his girlish wife were domesticated beneath our roof. 

The frigate's repairs were soon completed, and she was again under sailing orders. My son flew 
to his station, leaving his bride, in strong hysterics, reclining in her mother's arms. I saw nothing 
of her during the absence of my son, and she neglected to answer our letters. Rumor, with its mys- 
terious knowledge of unseen events and thousand means of propagation, spoke lightly of her con- 
duct, and hinted at the general levity of her behavior in society at New York, but I was unable to 
collect any positive evidence of impropriety. The presentiment of coming evil giew stronger with- 
in me, and but a short time elapsed before my woi'st anticipations were fulfilled. 

Again did victory sit upon the prow of the noble frigate, and again did my son nobly bear his 
share of the danger and the glory of the cruize. On his return to port, he hastened to the arms of 
his wife, but found her not. She was from home, but her parents could not assign the place of her 
sojourn, nor the name of the family to whom the pretended visit was being paid. It was impossible 
to silence the mouths of the many ; my son found his young wife in a neighboring village, residing, 
under a false name, beneath the same roof with a married man — a fellow notorious for his unprinci- 
pled gallantries and shameless desertion of his victims. The husband demanded reparation for the 
injury committed upon his honor : the seducer sneered at his impetuosity, and declared that the lady- 
was not worth fighting for, as he had merely offered her a little consolation in her husband's absence, 
who was now most heartily welcome to his wife again. A violent blow stopped the current of the 
heartless rufHan's impudence. It was impossible for him to submit to this pubhc insult, and an im- 
mediate meeting was demanded. In one hour, my heart-stricken boy had fallen a victim to the skill 
and coolness of the practised duellist; the bullet passed into his body, severely injuring the spine in 
its passage. He died, in bloody agony, writhing on the ground like a hurt snake. His honorable 
murderer gazed upon the deaih pangs of his antagonist with unabashed effrontery; and when the 
last struggle had taken place, he sent his officiating friend to the lady, with his respects, and as he 
was about departing from that neighbor-hood, he wished to know if she intended to bear him com- 
pany. In a few months, she died while giving birth to a dead child— the fruit of her illicit amour. 

Here, at the bottom of the skull of the cannibal, is the murderer's bullet, extracted from the body 
of my son. A shred of blue cloth, a portion of his coat, still adhei-es to the flattened lead, as it was 
forced into the wound — but the blood of my child has altei-ed its original tint. 

I have mentioned his mother's death as the result of the fate of her beloved boy. The boatswain's 
mate never forgave himself foi neglecting to guard over the welfare of his preserver. He swore 
eternal vengeance, and made anxious inquiries as to the whereabouts of the seducer, but without ef- 
fect. Shortly after the termination of the war, the sailor heard that the murderer had joined the 
army, and was quartered at New Orleans. He instantly undertook the long and perilous journey, 
and on his arrival there, found that his information was correct. The rulSan was pointed out while 
he was walking on the Levee — the sailor struck him a violent blow with his fist, and bade him re- 
member Lieutenant . The officer rose, and as the other was again rushing at him, buried his 

bowie knife in the seaman's breast. 

The seducer still lives; he associates with men of mark and public estimation, and is accounted 
an honorable man. Twice lately has my sight been blasted by his smiling visage in the open streets. 
His presence checks the very current of my blood ; and while the direst craving for revenge dilates 
my heart, I feel my impotence, and curse my failing age. My wife's death, my son's blood, the 
slaughter of the brave seaman, and the untimely fate of the infatuated girl — all — all — rest upon his 
soul — and yet he smiles ! he revels in the graces of fortune, and enjoys the esteem of all mankind. 
The world goes well with him — but I am childless — wifeless — friendless — and yet I have not sinned!

Here, in this pigeon-hole, are some singular papers, worthy a longer preservation. Here is the 
certificate of ray registry amongst the members of the Queen Charlotte Fire Company of Philadel- 
phia, some half dozen years before the final rapture between the colonies and the mother country. 
In those days, the most aristocratic fiimilies deemed it their duty to attend to the care of the various 
engines, and their attendant hooks, buckets, and ladders. I doubt much if the whole of the present 
race of tight-coated and tight-strapped dandies, with their effeminate lispings and conceited strut 
could have drasged one of our rude and heavy fire machines along the rough unpaved ground — or 
have mustered sufficient strength of mind and energy of purpose to have framed and issued the De- 
claration of Independence. 

Here is a letter from Dr. Franklin to my father, with the details of an improved lightning rod, in-

jamin Frrnklin. January, 1741." On the cover, my father's name is written in a strange cramped 
hand, with this addition — " from his friend B. F., who desires a sincere opinion." The poor state 
of the printing and the coarseness of the paper present a striking contrast to tlie elegant periodicals 
of the present day. 

Here are letters on law matters from Aaron Burr, to whose name the stigma of treason has been 
attached for attempting that which has conferred glory upon the heroes of Texas and Canada. 

Here are two miniatures, each depicting a lovely and a youthful face, which, in its day, has been 
the object of my love — but the emotions which they excited in my heart were of the opposite de- 
grees of passion — the boy's senseless adoration of the pretty face of his first sweetheart, and the 
calm fondness of a brother for the sisterly companion of his declining age. 

Eliza H , " my boyhood's love," was a lively girl, but some few years my senior. She was 

the daughter of one of the first citizens of Philadelphia, who boasted that his father's father assisted 
WilUam Penn from the boat, when he first placed his foot upon the Delaware shore. Eliza was a 
mad coquette — a romp, who playfully robbed you of your heart, and when, in sober earnestness, 
you pressed your suit, amused herself by laughing at the agonies of her victim, and wondering at 
his presumptuous boldness. I was fearfully in love with her, and at one time believed that I had 
inspired her with a reciprocal passion ; but when I ventured upon a declaration, she laughed with 
unrestrained heartiness at " the boy's assurance," and threatened to have me whipped if I mention- 
ed love again. My wounded pride cured my love, upon the principle of counter-irritation. Ehza 
married a Quaker residing in New Jersey, became the mother of numerous children, and died, about 
thirty years since, a withered toothless dame. 

My sister, the subject of the other miniature, has also passed through the gates of death. We 
saw her married to the man of her heart — she was the mother of three babes — the centre of a de- 
lighted circle of friends. The last visitation of the yellow pestilence removed her and her children 
from that earth which she had assisted to render heavenly. Her husband deeply felt his loss ; he 
neglected his business, and eventually failed. He encouraged a propensity to indulge in the false 
excitement of intemperance — a few months finished his career. 

I am now alone — alone in this wide unfriendly world. I have been twice wedded — have been a 
father, i ejoicing in the noble bearing of my manly child ; I have proudly gazed upon my sister's pro- 
geny, and traced with a delighted eye the softened likeness of my venerable parent in the youthful 
lineaments before me. But I am now alone. My acquaintances are of another race of men ; I have 
no fellow-feeling, no community of interests with these creations of yesterday. My habits and 
thoughts are those of a by-gone age. I have outlived the current of the times. 

I dare not say, with the Indian woman who, having attained an enormous age, had seen, like me, 
all her relations and fi lends committed to the earth — " I do not die, because God hath forgotten me" 
The painful events with which the Almighty has been pleased to afflict me are evidence that I have 
not been forgotten ; but, in bowing my head to the chastening blow, I anticipate an hereafter reward 
in the presence of the beloved beings who have been called before me to a state of bliss — " for whom 
the Lord loveth, he chasteneth — blessed be the name of the Ijord." 



THINGS I LOVE 



BY JOHH^ HICKMAK, JR. 



I love to watch the slcepiiig ehild, 
A playful, cherub boy — 

The mother's smile of tenderness^ 
Her swelling, heavenly joy. 

I love the maiden's dewy eye, 
Her softly pencil'd cheek. 

Like flushings of the sun-set hour 
Upon a snowy peak. 

I love to hear the hoary man 
Repeat his perils o'er — 

And read his shifting book of life, 
A chronicle of yore. 



I love the faintly echoing horn — 
The rushing, bounding chase — 

The fearless leap of huntsmen bold 
Across a chasm place. 

I love to catch, at summer eve, 

The mellow music-note 
Of merry voices on the lake. 

Where glides the white-winged boat. 

But, more than all, I love my home, 

The lowly, narrow cot — 
I would not barter with a king, 

A steepy, sea-side spot.

FIELD SPOUTS and MANLY PASTIMES. 



BY AN EXPERIENCED PEACTITIONER, 



GYMNASTICS AND GYMNASIA. 



It may be truly said, that the revival of Gymnastics, so long buried under the ruins of antiquity, 
is one of the greatest advancements yet made in the science of education, and not among the least 
conspicuous improvements of the present enlightened age. Every one who reflects — every one who 
knows anything, knows, and by experience, how intimate a connexion there exists between body 
and mind — how invariably the healthy or sickly temperament of the one influences that of the other; 
that when the body is strong, healthy, and active, so is the mind cheerful and elastic, and that when 
the former is sickly and diseased, so is the latter languid and depressed. The ancient Greeks and 
Romans understood this; and their education was accordingly directed to the development, not only 
of the mental, but also of the corporeal powers; and this corporeal branch of education was termed 
Gymnastics. 

The earliest account we have of gymnastic exercises is in Homer's Iliad, book the twenty-third, 
in which are described the games celebrated at the funeral of Patroclus. The Grecian gymnastics 
consisted of chariot racing, boxing, wrestling, foot races, drawing the bow, hurling javelins, etc. 

Plato states, that one Herodicus introduced this art into physic ; and Hippocrates, who lived at a 
later period, recommended it ; but as physicians did not adopt all the exercises of the gymnastic art, 
it came to be divided between them and the teachers of warlike and athletic exercises, who kept 
schools for the purpose. 

From Greece, gymnastic exercises were imported into the Roman empire, where the young mer\ 
were exercised in athletic sports in a large plain, by the side of the Tiber, called the Campus Mar- 
tius, or in public schools, termed Gymnasia, or Palestrae ; but as the amusements did not differ ma- 
terially from those in Greece, it is unnecessary to describe them. 

In the middle ages, when education got into the hands, and was at the sole disposal of the monks, 
it is not surprising that Gymnastics altogether disappeared. The lords of the soil indeed, knights 
and princes, contended at their splendid tilts and tournaments ; but the mass of the people were de« 
graded and enslaved, the more effectually to administer to the pleasures and the pride of their oj- 
pressors. This age of chivalry, as it was termed, passed away however in succeeding ages ; even 
these knightly games became extinct, and Gymnastics, gradually losing ground, were at length re- 
duced to the very name, known possibly to some musty philosophers who might have stumbled on 
it in their insane, because indiscriminate, enthusiasm for whatever might bear the stamp of barba- 
rism or antiquity. 

The nearest approach to the true exercises of the Gymnasium proper, of which we find an ac 
count in any of the British records, is to be met with in the " Sports and Pastimes" of Joseph Stiutt. 

" Hopping-matches for prizes," he says, " were occasionally made in the sixteenth century, as we 
learn from John Heywoode, the epigrammatist. In his Proverbs are the following lines : 

Where wooers hoppe in and out, long time may bring 
Him that hoppeth best, at last to have the ring — 
— I hoppying without for a ringe of a rushe. 



162 ' burton's gentleman's magazine. 

And again, in a play called the four P's, by the same author, one of the characleis is directed to 
-* hop upon one foot ;' and another says — 

Here were a hopper to hop for the ring." 

Mention is also made of the Ladder-Dance — " so called because the performer stands upon a ladder, 
which he shifts from place to place, and ascends or descends, without losing the equilibiium, or per- 
mitting it to fall." 

In regard to those mere feats of agility and dexterity, for which our tumblers, rope-dancers, and 
circus-riders are now famous, we meet with enough to prove that they have been at all times prac- 
tised in England, and indeed throughout Europe, and many other portions, both of the civilized and 
uncivilized world; but the practice of gymnastic exercises, as a system, for the useful purposes of 
invigorating the body and imparting elasticity to the mind, has been only lately revived from anti- 
quity. To Professors Gutsmuths and Jahn, the merit of the discovery and revival of this long lost 
art, — " this lelic of an age gone by," — is more particularly due. After a careful examination of the 
structure of the human body, they devised numerous exercises, arranged them in a well adapted se- 
ries, and again restored Gymnastics to something lite their former rank and importance. 

It was in Denmark that these exercises were first consideied in a national point of view; and in. 
1803 the number of gymnastic establishments in that country had amounted to fourteen, in which 
three thousand young men were educated. Indeed, on the continent generally, the system spread. 

In many towns of Germany and Switzerland, Gymnasia were established. The youth, and even 
.grown men, soon derived more pleasure from exercises which fortified, than from pleasures which 
paralized, the powers of their bodies. By the consciousness of increased vigor, the mind, too, be- 
came powerfully excited, and strove for equal perfection ; and the constant ambition of every pupil 
■was to veiify in his own instance, the truth of the adage, " Mens sana in corpore sana — A sound 
/inind in a healthy hodi/." Even the naturally iirdolent were irresistibly carried awav by the zeal 
of their comrades; persons, diseased and weakly, recovered their health, for the restoration of which 
these exercises were possibly the only effectual remedy. The certificates of physicians wherever 
Gymnastics were introduced, concurred as to their healthful tendency, nor were the highest testimo- 
nials from parents and teachers found wanting. Indeed, all young men who cultivated them, were 
acknowledged to have impioved in health and morals, and to have acquired an open, fiee, and grace- 
ful deportment. For many years past, Gymnastics have been introduced into England, and have 
met with decided success. They have been patronized by the govenrment — have been adopted in 
-the army ; in the Royal Military, and Naval Schools ; besides the Charter-house, and many private 
establishments. Private Gymnasia, too, have also appe ired in various parts of the metropolis, 
and received considerable encouragemeirt. But in order to render Gymnastics generally beneficial, 
and to secure to them a permanent and a national basis, a Public Gymnasium was at length esta- 
blished in several parts of London and the environs, for the admission of all persons of character and 
respectability, and on terms as irearly as possible proportioned to their pecuniary abilities. Its con- 
duct and regulation were placed under the management of a society, formed by their own body. 

That such institutions are desirable in large cities, will be obvious to all who reflect on the impos- 
sibility of persons whose employments are sedentary, attaining, after the confinement and anxiety of 
the day, a requisite portion of healthful exercise and excitement to recruit and exhilarate the spirit, 
and restore the tone of languid nature. This object, it will be admitted, is not accomplished by the 
dull, monotonous, and even the pernicious practice of listlessly strolling about the streets without a 
definite or a useful motive; still less, by dissipating the remnant of their already abused faculties in 
the unhallowed atmosphere of the tavern or the club. To the clerk, this course will but accelerate 
the mischief arising from eight or ten hours' " dry drudgery at the desk's dead wood ;" to the aitizaa 
it is not calculated to ensure peaceful slumbers, and to enable him to meet the duties of the morrow 
-*' with nerves new-braced and spirits cheered." 

In hypochondriacal, and all other melancholy disorders, people are too apt to acquire the notion, 
that mind alone is concerned ; whereas, the body will usually be found to own at least an equal 
share, if not indeed the original, of the evil. There is a mutual re-action between them, and by les- 
sening it on one side, you diminish the pain on both. Hypochondria is the name of one of the re- 
gions of the stomach — a very instructive etymology. The blood of a melancholy man is thick and 
slow ; that of a lively man, clear and quick. A natural conclu^iun therefore, is, that the remedy 
would be found in putting the blood into action, " By ceaseless action all that is, suteists." Ex- 
ercise is the best means of effecting it, as the impulse given by artificial stimuli is too sudden, the 
effect too transitory, and the cost to nature too great. Plato had so high an opinion of the medici- 
nal powers of exercise for disorders of the mind, that he said it was even a cure for a wounded con- 
.•science. 

The want of exercise, says Dr. Blackmore, is a preparatory cause of the gout, and this is war- 
ranted by long experience ; for instance, the sedentary lawyer, and the unwearied student who con- 
tinually converse with their books, and seldom employ themselves in exercise, thereby often con-

tract the gout. The sauntering, supine, and oscitant gentleman, by his birth and great possessions, 
exempt from labor and exercise, therefore is entitled to diseases." 

" If much study," says Dr. Cheyne, " be joined to the want of exercise, it becomes then douhly 
prejudicial, and will, if long pursued, ruin the strongest constitutions. 

" Hard study never foils to destroy the appetite, and produce all the symptoms already enumera- 
ted, W'ith headaches, vertigoes, costiveness, wind, crudities, apoplexies, and palsy. 

" If inactivity and want of exercise are joined with luxury, the solids become relaxed and weak- 
ened, and the acrimony of the salts and hiunors gradually increase, then chronical disorders are pro- 
duced, such as gout, erysipelas, rheumatisms, -with all the pains, miseries, and torments arising in 
this low sunk state of the constitution." 

It is difficult to convince sedentary people, but it is a duty to attempt persuading them, that their 
usual habits waste the spirits, destroy health, and shorten life. Hundreds in each of our large cities 
die every year for want of exercise. 

It is by no means necessary that we should cultivate Gymnastics " after the manner of the an- 
cients," but only so for as may be requisite to maintain the even tenor of existence. The state of 
society in towns continually imposes obstructions to health, and offers inducements to the slothful, 
in the shape of palliatives, which ultimately increase the " miseries of human life." Exercise is both 
a prevention and a remedy ; but we must not mistake — diligence is not necessarily exercise. 

Our ordinary pastimes are now almost all within doors ; those of out progenitors in England were 
more in the open air. They danced on the green in the day-time; we, if we dance at all, move 
about in warm rooms at night ; and then there are the " late hours," the " making a toil of pleasure," 
the lying in bed late the next morning, the incipacity to perform duties in consequence of "recrea- 
tion !" The difference to health is immense — tire difference to morals is not less. If reflection be 
troublesome, read the proceedings in courts of justice and then reflect. We have much to unlearn.

THE INTERIOR OF MR. BARRETT'S GYMNASIUM, 

WALNUT STREET, PHILADELPHIA. 



An institution which has met with decided eircomagement, and which, we are happy to add, de- 
serves it. Mr. B. has introduced many improvements upon former plans, in regard to his machinery, 
regulations, and exercises. Some general idea of these latter may be gained from an inspection 
of the engraving. In our next number, we will enter into minute details respecting this aird similar 
institutions — giving an entire code of "Instructions for Gymnasis." It would be a source of great 
pleasure to us if we could be the means, in any degree, of exciting interest upon a subject which, 
however frivolous it may appear, is yet one of so much real importance.

The Waverly Novels, with the Author's last Corrections and Additions ; complete in Five Volumes' 

Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

We had occasion to notice the enterprise of the above booksellers in our remarks upon the splendid 
volume of Scott's works, devoted to his poetry, which issued from their press a few months past ; 
in one book, scarcely more ponderous than the original edition of the Lay of the Last Minstrel, the 
whole of Sir Walter's poetry is gathered together, including various minor pieces never before pub- 
lished. We have now a continuation of the same glorious edition — the entire " Waverly Novels" 
are presented in Five Octavo Volumes ; the author's last corrections and additions are included ; and 
his valuable notes grace the text matter in appropriate relation. The type is clear and sufficiently 
bold to render its perusal an easy task ; the papei is of the same consistency and whiteness that won 
our admiration in the volume of poetry ; and a well-engraved Steel Likeness, from the original pic- 
ture by Newton, in the possession of Murray the bookseller, gives additional value to the work. We 
have no hesitation in saying that Carey and Hart's edition of Sir Walter Scott's works is the best 
library and family edition ever printed, either in England or America. 



Fanny, and other Poems. One Volume. Harper and Brothers, New York. 

Mr. Halleck's muse but seldom condescends to flap her wings in the Parnassian atmosphere ; the 
publishers, therefore, with due consideration of the wants of the devotees of Apollo, kindly furnish 
us with a repetition of the former flutterings of her graceful pinions. We should rejoice to welcome 
a novelty from the pen of Halleck ; there are so few real poets now extant, that we cannot allow one 
of the highest of the craft to waste his days "in ease inglorious," without a word of reproach — and 
this new edition of our favorite " Fanny" is a mouthful of sweets that makes us wish for a larger 
feast. 



A Reply to the Critics. By Samuel F. Glenn. Washington, 1839. 

This boy will be the death of us ! Here is another " little pamphlet," printed at the sole expense of 
the " littery" Sammy, and devoted to our positive extermination from the list of periodicals. Why, 
dear Sammy, will you persist in spending your hard earnings to prove yourself an ass 1 Be assured 
that you are already sufficiently ridiculous in the eyes of those to whom you gratuitously forward 
youi productions ; and if your respectable maternal parent neglected sending you to a Sunday School 
in your days of bibs and bread and butter, it is notincumbent upon you to exhibit the depth of your 
ignorance to " the world at large !" 

Our readers may not recollect Sammy. We had occasion lately to notice his arrogance in pre- 
suming to address a hterary society and publish Essays on Criticism, when he is not only un- 
acquainted with the syntactical construction of sentences, but literally unable to spell correctly the 
words which he pi esses mto his service. Our critical remarks have engendered Sammy's ire — and, 
lo ! the result — an octave of mendacious ignorance and vituperation, levelled at all critics who have 
had the honesty to ridicule the pretensions of this particular gander of the capitol, this Virgil of Goose 
Creek — and at ourselves primarily and most particularly. 

We are not angry with Sammy, although he lets drive at us " with savage earnestness and 
vengeful play." Sammy insists upon it that he is a great wiiter — that the bad grammar and mis-speUing 
evident in all his productions, are the faults of the various printers employed — nay he even confesses 
that such errors luill be found in his forthcoming work. Sammy once inflicted an hour's talk upon 
our suffering nature, when he uttered more bad language than a mad cockney in a farce. Was the 
printer to blame, then 1 We have a letter written by Sammy's own hand, wherein Priscian's head 
is broken with painful frequency ; and we also possess the manuscript of a poem, by Sammy, wherein 
he pathetically asks a weeping willow why it hangs its head so sorry fully. This is no typographi- 
cal error, for the printer has never yet seen this poem, and we are doubtful if he ever will. 

Sammy F. Glenn reminds us of a certain little Scotch manager whilom of our acquaintance, who 
bores every editor within blarneying distance till he obtains the insertion of a self-written commend- 
ation either of his most unpopular management or of his execrable stage assumptions — performances 
vs'hich the good sense of the American public has nearly driven from the stage. This besotted man 
parades the false notice as a specimen of public opinion ; but if an honest critic ventures to give a 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 165 

line of reproof or even to hint a wish of amendment in the parsimonious system of management, the 
conceited bigot raises the cry of persecution, and denounces the editor as a personal foe, or a tool in 
the hands of a clique of enemies. Just so it is with his brother humbug, Sammy Glenn, who practises 
•villanous means of puffing hitherto unknown in the annals of Grub street — but vituperates, in bad 
grammar, the critic who ridicules the Essays and Lectures of a Utleraire who is unable to spell cor- 
rectly a word of three syllables. 

Sammy sends copies of his productions to every editor vi'ithin reach ; if the " notices" are honor- 
able he greedily publishes them as puffs, but if unfavorable, he declares that the work was printed 
for private circulation, and ought not to have been criticised — or that "his poems /ro;« the nature 
of their emission were sacred to criticism." Any one who understands the English language 
would imagine that " sacred to criticism" meant consecrated or devoted to that purpose — but poor 
ignorant Sammy intended to mean just the reverse ! However, the printers can bear the blame. 

Sammy has not attempted to answer any one of our objections to the consummate nonsense fabri- 
cated by him both in his Essay and his Lecture — a lecture which he says was printed at the request 
of the literary society before which it was delivered. Is it possible that there exists a literary society 
so common-place in its material as to allow our stultified Sammy to insult them in a lecture ? did 
they not observe the longitude of the ears beneath his lion's skin 1 were they not awakened to a 
sense of sight by the sound of his asinine bray 1 We say again that Sammy has not attempted to 
answer our objections, but contents himself with accusing us of distorting our quotations, and of 
criticising an extract from Campbell as the writing of Sammy himself. Not so, Sammy ; we took 
your position and its predication, divested of the parenthetical absurdities which confused your mean- 
ing — there was no necessity to give the whole of your rigmarole paragraphs ; and as to the quotation, 
we did not affirm that you wrote it, but said that you had introduced a very tender and beautiful 
sentence in support of your doctrine. This language is very different to accusing you of writing 
any thing emanating from the pen of Campbell. Oh, Sammy, Sammy, where do you expect to 
go when you die 1 

We shall not again notice our friend Sammy's attacks ; we cannot spare room for the paltry sub- 
ject, nor find time for the unprofitable task. If his " little pamphlets," are sent to us, \te shall notice 
them as they deserve ; as we do every other publication placed in our hands. We thank him 
cordially for the trouble he has taken in proving the correctness of our criticisms, and in circulating 
the proofs at his own expense. His " Reply to the Critics" is the best puff of our magazine that we 
could possibly issue, and establishes the honest correctness of our literary opinions beyond the power 
of denial. Sammy's "Introduction"aloiie proves all that we have asserted of his ignorance; it con- 
sists of three lines and a half, yet contains four flagrant violations of propriety. Here it is. 

" I am urged to the following very brief reply by the consideration that the critics in question 
have gained a literary standing of some degree in this country, and have disseminated statements 
which, as I hope to prove herein, are alike obnoxious to liberality and to truth." 

" The critics in question.^' What critics 1 who are they ? No persons have as yet been named, 
nor has \he gravamen of the matter been stated ; the question is not yet before the reader. 

" A literary standing ofsoine degree in this country." A phrase most Glennish and obscure. Of 
what degree 1 as big as all out doors, or as small as a lump of chalk 1 

"As I hope to prove herein." In where 1 in the introduction consisting of three lines and a half, 
or in " the following brief reply 1" 

" Obnoxious to liberality and truth." Sammy, we confess the soft impeachment — we are obnoxious 
to liberality and truth. Borrow a dictionary, man, and find the meaning of the word. Why do you 
venture upon a four-syllabler without a previous investigation 1 Obnoxious means liable, or subject, 
or exposed to anything — not opposed or inimical, as we imagine you intended to say. Sammy, you 
must save up half a dollar, and purchase a dictionary. 

Gentle reader, if three lines and a half contain four distinct misusages of the English language, 
how many are likely to be contained in a '' little pamphlet" of Sammy Glenn's slip-slop 1 

Sammy talks rabidly about the malignancy of our depraved heart ! poor, dear, Sammy ! we bear you 
no ill will. If you dislike our critiques why do you send us your " little pamphlet '?" why do you 
concoct falsities, and publish puffs, of your own fabrication, and write impudent letters? Reflect and 
refrain, or your name will become a bye-word for ignorance and pretension ! If you have any relatives 
of respectabihty, issue another printed circular, and swear that you are not the author of the little 
pamphlet wiitten by one Sammy F. Glenn. For the sake of your future prosperity, we advise you 
in the parental language of the elder Wellei — " Samivel, Samivel, you had better prove a hallibi !" 



A Voice to Youth, Addressed to young Men and young Ladies. By Rev. J. M. Austin. Second 
Edition. Grosh and Hutchifison, Utica. 

This is a truly valuable and well wiitten work. The chapters which compose it were originally 
pubhshed in the " Evangelical Magazine and Gospel Advocate," during the years 1837 and 1838, 



166 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

and met with general approbation from a very large circle of readers. Messieurs Grosli and Hutchin- 
son, for whom it was originally written, were induced by its popularity to re-publish it. The first edi- 
tion (in book form) of 1500 copies, was exhausted in a few monihs — the present has an appendix, 
together with additions and amendments by the author. 

The whole is divided into three parts — A Voice to 3"outh, a Voice to young Men, and a Voice to 
young Ladies. We like every ponion of the work, but would especially recommend the two Chapters 
on " Habits"— as well as those on " Reading" and " Self-Cultivation." 



Historical Sketches of Statesmen luho Jlo wished in the Time of George III, Second Series, By 
Heiiry Lord Brougham, F. R. S,, and Member of the National Institute of France. Two Vo- 
lumes. Lea and Blanchurd, Philadelphia. 

The first series of these Sketches excited a profound attention in all the better classes of readers. 
The epoch depicted, in the character of its leading men, was one of pre-eminent importance, either 
morally or politically considered ; and the man who professed to depict it, was one who had very largely 
influenced both its moral and political condition. All people too had faith in the ability, and nearly 
all in the impartiality of the artist — who did not disappoint the expectations which had been formed. 
Few biographies have better chance of going down to posterity, or of going down with a richer 
freight of authenticity and truth, than these Sketches of the Statesmen of the Time of George HI. 

The Second Series is, to Americans, more fraught with interest than the first. We have here 
mementos of Charles Carroll, of Lafayette, and of Washington — portraits by a master-hand — a hand 
too which would have done its subjects justice had the sky fdlien. We cannot conceive, indeed, 
what some of our daily papers have meant, or intended to mean, by the assertion that Lord Brougham 
has under-rated the talents of our First President. Surely the bitterness of some of their paragraphs 
is an ill repayment of so noble a panegyric as this ! 

" How grateful the relief which the friend of mankind, the lover of virtue, experiences when, turn- 
ing from the contemplation of such a character, his eye rests upon the greatest man of our own or 
any age ; — the only one upon whom an epithet so thoughtlessly lavished b}' men, to foster the crimes 
of their worst enemies, may be innocently and justly bestowed! In Washington we truly behold a 
marvellous contrast to almost every one of the endowments and the vices which we have been con- 
templating ; and which are so well fitted to excite a mingled admiration, and sorrow, and abhorrence. 
With none of that brilliant genius which dazzles ordinary minds; with not even any remarkable 
quicknes-: of apprehension ; with knowledge less than almost all persons in the middle ranks, and 
many well educated of the humbler classes possess ; this eminent person is presented to our observa- 
tion clothed in attributes as modest, as unpretending, as little calculated to strike or to astonish, as if 
he had passed unknown through some secluded region of private life. But he had a judgment sure 
and sound ; a steadiness of mind which never suffered any passion, or even any feeling to ruffle its 
calm ; a strength of understanding which worked rather than forced its way through all obstacles — 
removing or avoiding rather than overleaping them. If profound sagacity, unshaken steadiness of 
purpose, the entire spbjugation of all the passions which carry havoc through ordinary minds, and 
oftentimes lay waste the fairest prospects of greatness — nay, the discipline of those feelings which are 
wont to lull or to seduce genius, and to mar and to cloud over the aspect of virtue herself — ^joined 
with, or rather leading to the most absolute self-denial, the most habitual and exclusive devotion to 
principle — if these things can constitute a great character, without either quickness of apprehension, 
or resources of information, or inventive powers, or any brilliant quality that might dazzle the 
vulgar — then surely Washington was the greatest man that ever lived in this world uninspired by 
Divine wisdom, and unsustained by supernatual virtue." 

The personages included in the two volumes now before us are George IV. (with Sir John Leach 
and others ;) Lord Eldon ; Sir William Scott (Lord Stowell ;) Dr. Lawrence ; Sir Philip Francis; 
Mr. Home Tooke ; Lord Castlereagh ; Lord Liverpool ; Mr. Tierney ; Lord St. Vincent ; Lord Nel- 
son ; Mr. Horner; Lord King; Mr. Ricardo; Mr. Curran; Charles Carroll; Neckar; Madame de 
Stael; the Mirabeau Family; Carnot; Lafayette; Talleyrand; Napoleon ; and Washington. 

Not the least interesting portion of the work is a hint, in the Introduction, that the writer is oc- 
cupied in histories of the reigns of Harry V., and Elizabeth. The literary world will welcome theiu 
enthusiastically'. 

Whatever opinion may be entertained of the political or moral honesty of Lord Brougham, few 
men of intellect have been found to question his extraordinary powers of mind; his wide comprehen- 
sion, and strong grasp of thought ; his exceeding energy ; his rude but commendable directness and 
Demosthemic vigor of expression. If he be, indeed, the sly knave his little enemies have painted 
him, it must be admitted that the undeniable qualities we have specified have an odd inaccordance 
with his true character. He must be the most inconsistent human being upon the face of the earth. 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 167 

He must have an outward and visible spirit belying the invisible spirit within. He must be like the 
statue in Lucian with its surface of Parian marble, and its interior filled with rags. It appears to us, 
however, that his known deficiencies, as well as his known capacities, aie precisely those of a chival- 
rous heait, not less than of a gigantic understanding. 



Letters of Euza Wilkinson, during the Invasion and Possession of Charleston, S. C, hy the 
British in the Revolutionary War. Arranged from the Original Manuscript by Caroline Gil- 
7nan. Samuel Colman, New York. 

These Letters, twelve in number, and filling about a hundred openly-piinted duodecimo pages, 
handsomely bound, arc occupied in part with minute details of such atrocities on the part of the 
British during their sojourn in Charleston, as the quizzing of Mrs. Wilkinson and the pilfering of 
her shoe-buckles — the remainder being made up of the indignant comments of the lady. It is very 
true, as the preface to this volume assures us, that " few records exist of American women either be- 
fore or during the war of the revolution, and that those peipetuated by history, although honorable, 
particularly to the Southern States, want the charm of personal narration" — but then we are well 
delivered from such charms of personal narration as we find here. The only supposable merit in 
the compilation is that dogged air of truth with which the fair authoress tells the lamentable story of 
her misadventures. We look in vain for the " useful information" about which some of our con- 
temporaries have spoken; unless indeed it is in the passage where we are told that the letter-writer 
" was a yoimg and beautiful widow ; that her hand-writing is clear and feminine ; and that the 
letters were copied by herself into a blank quarto book on which the extravagant sale-price marks 
one of the features of the times." There are other extravagant sale-prices, however, besides that. 
In regard to the talk in the preface, about " gathering relics of past history," and " floating down 
streams of time," v/e should call it all fudge. The whole book is exceedingly silly, and we cannot 
conceive why Miss Caroline Gilman thought the public wanted to read it. As for Mrs. Wilkinson, 
she deserved to lose her shoe-buckles. 



Birds and Flowers, and Other Country Things. By Mary Hoioitt. Weeks, Jordan and Co., 

Boston. 

This a very beautiful little book — regard it as we will. Here we have good paper, good printing, 
good binding, wdl-executed wood-cuts from excellent drawings — and poems by Mary Howitt. We 
presume there are few of our readers who are not well acquainted with the character of the writings 
of this lady — v,'ith that sportive and quaint grace, which keeps dear of the absurd, by never employ- 
ing itself upon subjects of a very exalted nature. It cannot be denied that our sweet poetess. Miss 
Gould, has drawn much of her inspiration from a study of the fair quakeress of whom we speak. 
The two styles are nearly identical — the choice of themes is one and the same thing in both writers. 
They appear to echo and re-echo each other. At the same time we must do Miss Gould the justice 
to say that she has greatly improved upon her model, by a more careful elaboration of materials, re- 
sulting in a polished epigrammatism, not always obscivable in the English poems, and admirably 
well suited to the nature and capacities of her Muse — at least so far as that Muse is shown in a 
proper light. 

In a notice, elsewhere, of the writings of Miss Gould, we spoke at length of the leading traits of 
her general style, and commented upon certain occasional bursts of a far higher order of merit than 
appertained to her ordinary manner — flashings forth of a far brighter fire. It appeared to us, indeed, 
that her usual vein was the result rather of some affectation, than of true impulse — rather of some 
perversion of taste, through eaily prejudice or partiality, persisted in until matured into habit — than 
of the unbiassed promptings of the spirit. We had then never seen a collection of the poems of Miss 
H. Having seen them, we find our suspicions fully confnmed. But Miss G. should not consent 
to be in any degree an imitator — even of what is so well worthy imitation as the delightful poetry 
of Mary Howitt. 



Tales of Shipivrecks and Other Disasters at Sea. By Thomas Bingley, Author of"' Stories about 
Vogs," etc. Weeks, Jordan and Co., Boston. 

No subject in the world has so deep an interest for youth as that of the perils and disasters of the 
sea ; and Mr. Bingley, who is well known for his abilities in telling stories to young people — not an 



168 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

easy thing to do cleverly — has here succeeded in making a capital volume on the spirit-stirring 
theme. We cannot say that the designs are well drawn — it would be positively against our con- 
science — but perhaps they will answer their purpose. The book, in every other respect, is worthy 
of commendation. 



The American Flower- Garden Companion ,- Adapted to the Northern and Middle States. By Ed- 
■luard Sayers, Landscape and Ornamental Gardener, Second Edition — Revised, with Additions. 
Weeks, Jordan and Co., Boston. 

It must be admitted that this is just such a book as the public have been long wanting — a con- 
cise, lucid, practical, sufficiently scientific, and cheap manual of Ornamental Horticulture. We are' 
especially sure that there is not a young lady in the land who will not be eager to thank Mr. Sayers 
for putting her in possession of the work. She will here find a thousand difficulties removed ; a 
thousand capital plans suggested ; a thousand novel hints in regard to mere forms of beauty — to meie 
matters of arrangement and taste — hints evidently emanating from a graceful mind, and not to be 
met with in volumes of higher price, larger dimensions and greater pretence. We speak particularly 
of such things as the physique and morale of the location and position of plants, of the formation 
and situation of rock, of ornamental waters and bridges, and of the planning and management of 
trellisses and arbors. But the volume contains every thing essential to the flower-gardener. It is di- 
vided into four heads — The Arrangement of the Garden and Propagation of Plants; The Culture 
of Plants; The Green-House ; and The Flower-Garden Miscellany. There is, also, a Glossary of 
Botanical Terms, and an Appendix, embracing Descriptive Lists of Annual and Biennial Flowers. 



The American Fruit-Garden Companion. Being a Practical Treatise oti the Propagation and 
Culture of Fruit ; Adapted to the Northern and Middle States. By. E, Sayers, Gardener; 
Author of the American Flower-Garden Companio?!, etc. Weeks, Jordan and Co., Boston. 

Here the design is to condense into the nrost convenient form, as a work of practical utility, re- 
marks on the culture and management of the different kinds of fruit adapted to the Middle and 
Northern States. In the commencement of the volume several pages have been appropriated to the 
phytology of plants, with a view of familiarizing the inexperienced cultivator with some of the lead- 
ing characteristics of trees. The subject is plainly and clearly handled. In the Nursery Department, 
which naturally follows the phytology, the author has given minute directions in regard to the pro- 
pagation of fruit-trees from seed, and the various methods of grafting, budding, and bringing the tree 
into the proper size and state for the final planting in the garden or orchard. Here he has adhered 
to a system of raising fruit-trees from seed, in preference to the usual method of suckers. He con- 
siders that the young plants rob the parent and impoverish the soil. Mr. Sayers has given through- 
out, the results of a long practice, and no little scientific information. 



The Bride of Fort Edward. Founded o?z an Incident of the Revolution. Samuel Caiman, New 

York. 

In looking over the preface of this little book, we fancied that we could perceive in it a certain air 
of thought really profound, disfigured by an attempt at over-profundity — and upon this idea we 
formed our anticipations of the book itself — not being altogether disappointed in the sequel. Our 
opinion, it will therefore be seen, is not fully in accordance with that of the press at large ; so far as 
we have observed their notices. 

The author, in apprising his readers that the " Bride of Foit Edward" is not, properly, a play, 
has drawn a just distinction between the hurried action, the crowded plot and the theatrical elevation, 
which the stage demands of the pure drama; and that merely dialogical/orm, in which he has chosen 
to convey the repose, the thought, and the sentiment of actual life. His particular object, as expressed 
by himself, will be found, upon examination, to justify the manner of his work. The story " is con- 
nected with a well-known crisis in our National History ; nay, it is itself a portion of the historic 
record, and as such, even with many of its most trifling minutiae, is embedded in our earliest recol- 
lections. But it is rather in relation to the abstract truth it embodies — as exhibiting a law in the re- 
lation of the human mind to its invisible protector — the apparent sacrifice of the individual, in the 
grand movements for the race — it is in this light rather than as an historical exhibition" — that he 
claims for it the attention of the public. 

This design is an excellent one, and is by no means badly executed ; except in the point of being 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 169 

overdone — of being too obviously insisted upon, throughout — and of being carried to a tianscendental 
extreme. We would be quite safe in saying that the writer is a passionate admirer of Coleridge — 
a man whose Jacob Behraen-ism makes, perhaps, as near an approach to the sublime of truth, as 
can possibly be made by utter unintelligibility and fustian. In all modifications of such minds as 
his, we are to look for more or less of a high spirit of poesy ; and, feeling this, we were not disap- 
pointed in meeting with this spirit in the volume before us. Here is imagination of no common order. 

Yet oftenest of that homeward path I think 
Amid the deepening twilight slowly trod ; 
And I can hear the click of that old gate 
As once again, amid the chirping yard, 
I see the summer rooms open and dark. 
And on the shady step the sister stand, 
Her merry welcome in a mock reproach 
Of Love's long childhood breathing. 

I could think this was peace — so calmly there 
Tlie afternoon amid the valley sleeps. 

How calm the night moves on ; and yet 



In the dark morroiv that behind those hills 

Lies sleeping now, who knows what horror lurks ? 

Yon mighty hunter in his silver vest, 
That o'er those azure fields walks nightly now, 
In his bright girdle wears the self-same gems 
That on the watchers of old Babylon 
Shone once, and to the soldier on her walls 
Marked the swift hour, as they do now to me. 

Having said thus much, however, we would not be misunderstood. Nothing less than a long 
apprenticeship to letters will give the author of the " Bride of Fort Edward" even a chance to be re- 
membered or considered. His work, if we view it in its minor points, is radically deficient in all the 
ordinary and indispensable proprieties of literature. Generally speaking, it cannot be denied that his 
verse is any thing but verse, and that his prose stands sadly in need of a straight-jacket. 



Charles Hartland, the Village Missionary. Revised and Prepared iy William A. Alcoit, Author 
of the " House I Live In," etc. Weeks, Jordan and Co., Boston. 

The simple design of this well-written little book is to convey moral and religious instruction, by 
exhibiting to the young, in pictures of every-day life, the excellence of virtue on the one hand, and 
the miseries of vice on the other. We are told, moreover, in the preface, that an attempt is made at 
showing " the importance and necessity of possessing the true missionary spirit, in all the ordinary 
concerns and relations of domestic life ; and, above all, in the discharge of the responsible duties of 
a teacher." The narrative has the undoubted merit of being true. 



Solomon Seesaw. By J. P. Robertson, Senior Author of Letters on Paraguay. Lea and Blan- 

chard, Philadelphia. 

In spite of many assertions to the contrary, we have no hesitation in calling Solomon Seesaw a 
very lively, a very well-written, and altogether a very readable book. The outcry against it has no 
doubt been made by those who would not look into its pages on account of an exceedingly ill-founded 
yet customary prejudice — we allude to the prevalent idea thut a writer who succeeds in matters-of- 
fact, can by no possibility succeed in matters of fiction. This opinion is not nearly so tenable as its 
converse — yet this converse is seldom insisted upon. The truth is, that a really good writer in any 
one department of literature, properly so called, will not be found to fail, essentially, in any one other 
to which he turns his attention, or in which he can be made to feel a sufficient interest. The 
popular voice, to be sure, has decided otherwise; but then, as the philosophical Chamfort well 
says — II y a a parier que toute idee publique, toute coiivention recue, est une sottise ,• car elk a ete 
convenue au plus grand nombre. 

Solomon Seesaw, without making outrageous pretensions, is a very entertaining personage. There 



170 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

is a great deal of vivacity about him, and much of a hearty, up-and-down and straight-forward 
Roderick-Random kind of incident and humor. The book is a very good book to take up in a rainy 
day. Mr, Robertson is not by any means an ordinary writer. The Introductory Chapter to this 
■work is especially well-written. Here is an Extract which will speak for itself. 

" Just so your move-about litterateur ; and especially your foreign one. Let us suppose him to be 
in Glasgow ; he hurries over breakfast, as fast as the bagman ; like him, he looks at his watch every 
five minutes ; he rings again and again for his tardily-brought toast and mufHns ; he scolds Boots 
for being so long with his boots; and he grudges himself the half hour required by the claims of ap- 
petite to allay the cravings of nature. 

He brushes his coat and hat in a hurry ; and out he sallies, with Boots junior as his companion 
and guide, to see the city of Glasgow ; to remark upon its traffic, edifices, institutions, inhabitants, 
and upon the enormous strides which scientific industry is making in her multifarious walks. All 
these important points are jotted down in a journal, which, being revised and corrected, is, at a sub- 
sequent period, to be reluctantly given to the press. 

Suppose your traveller to be a Frenchman, come across the Channel on a two months' tour, with 
a small stock of English got up for the occasion, and alarmed at every moment that passes without 
a jot in his memorandum book. 

He thus initiates his parley with Boots junior. 

Frenchman : — " Monsieur Boots, quelle rue — what street is dis 1" 

Boots: — " The Gorbals, sir." 

FiiENCHMA^jf : — " De Gobbels ; qu'est que ea, wat is dat 1" 

Boots : — " I dinna ken, sir." 

Frenchmak : — " Bete, stupid; no know do meaning of de street: remarquezca; il ne sait, 
peutetre, pourquoi on I'apelle " Boots." Monsieur Boots : vy dey call you " Boots ?" 

Boots: — " Becuz a clean the boots, and gang messages." 

FnENCHMAN : — " Ah, well ; he more adroit than I did not believe" (taking out his Glasgow guide.) 
" Were do University, Monsieur Boots ]" 

Boots : — " University, sir 1 — I dinna ken what you mean." 

Frenchjian : — " Bete : Ecossais: Ce gens-la sent vraiment stupides. L'Universite, jc dis ; were 
de young gens taught to read Greek." 

Boots : — " Oo the College, ye mean V 

Frenchmajt : — "Yes, yes, de College; go dere." 

Boots Cto himself: — " I fancy this man's a scholar ; bit, gif he is, he speaks a queer langidge„" 

Frenchman: — " Wat dat you say 1" 

Boots : — "Naething, sir. Here's the College." 

French^ian : — " Go in, done, and tell the professeur that one foreign gentleman wish to see de 
College of Glazcow." 

Boots freiurning-.J — "The maister says that he canna' be fashed the noo; for he's hearing his 
class."

Undine .• A Miniature Romance ; from the Gerinan of Baron de la Motte Fouque. Caiman's 
Library of Romance, Edited by Granville Mellen, Samuel Colman, New York. 

The re-publication of such a work as " Undine," in the very teeth of our anti-iomantic national 
character, is an experiment well adapted to excite interest, and in the crisis caused by this experi- 
ment — for a crisis it is — it becomes the duty of every lover of literature for its own sake and spiritual 
uses, to speak out, and speak boldly, against the untenable prejudices which have so long and so 
unopposedly enthralled us. It becomes, we say, his plain duty to show, with what ability he may 
possess, the full value and capacity of that species of writing generally, which, as a people, we are 
too prone to discredit. It is incumbent upon him to make head, by all admissible means in his

power, against that evil genius of mere matter-of-fact, whose grovelling and degrading assumptions 
are so happily set forth in the pert little query of Monsieur Casimir Peiier — "A quoi un poete est-il 
hon ?" The high claims of Undine, and its extensive foreign reputation, render it especially desirable 
that he should make use of a careful analysis of the work itself — not less than of the traits of its 
class — with a view of impressing upon the public mind, at least his individual sense of its most 
exalted and extraordinary character. Feeling thus, we are grieved that our limits, as well as the late 
hour in which we take up the book, will scarcely permit us to speak of it otherwise than at random. 
The story runs very nearly in this manner. 

Sir Huldbrand of Ringstetten, a knight of high descent, young, rich, valorous, and handsome, be- 
comes slightly enamored, at a tournament, of a lady Bertalda, the adopted daughter of a German 
Duke. She, being entreated by the knight for one of her gloves, promises it upon condition of his 
exploring the recesses of a certain haunted foiest. He consents, and is beset with a crowd of illusory 
and fantastic terrors, which, in tlie end, compel him to an extremity of the wood, where a long 
grassy peninsula, of great loveliness, juts out into the bosom of a vast lake. Of this peninsula, the 
sole inhabitants are an old fisherman and his wife, with their adopted daughter. Undine, a beautiful 
and fairy-like creature of eighteen, and of an extravagantly wild and perverse, yet amiable and artless 
temperament. The old couple had rejoiced, some years before, in a child of their own — who play- 
ing, one day, by the water's edge, fell in suddenly, and at once disappeared. In the depth of their 
grief for her loss, they were astonished and delighted, one summer's evening, with the appearance 
in their hut of the little Undine, who was dripping with water, and who could give no very distinct 
account of herself — her language being of a singular nature, and hej discourse turning upon such 
subjects as " golden castles" and " chrystal domes." She had remained with the fisherman and his 
wife ever since, and they had come to look upon her as theii own. 

By these good people Sir Huldbrand is hospitably entertained. In the meantime, a brook, swollen 
by rains, renders the peninsula an island, and thoroughly cuts off his retreat. In the strict intercourse 
which ensues, the young man and maiden become lovers, and are finally wedded by a priest, who is 
opportunely cast away upon the coast. After the marriage, a new character seems to pervade Un- 
dine ; and she at length explains to her husband, (who is alarmed at some hints which she lets 
fall,) the true history of her nature, and of her advent upon the island. 

She is one of the race of water-spirits — a race who differ, personally, from mankind, only in a greater 
beauty, and in the circumstance of possessing no soul. The words of Undine, here divulging her 
secret to Huldbrand, will speak as briefly as we could do, and far more eloquently — " Both we, and 
the beings I have mentioned as inhabiting the other elements, vanish into air at death, and go out of 
existence, spirit and body, so that no vestige of us remains ; and when you hereafter awake to a purer 
state of being, we shall remain where sand, and sparks, and wind and waves remain. We of course 
have no souls. The element moves us, and, again, is obedient to our will, while we live, though it 
scatters us like dust when we die ; and as we have nothing to trouble us, we are as merry as nightin- 
gales, little gold-fishes, and other pretty children of nature. But all beings aspire to rise in the scale 
of existence higher than they are. It was therefore the wish of my father, who is a powerful water- 
prince in the Mediterranean Sea, that his only daughter should become possessed of a soul ; although 
she should have to endure many of the sufferings of those who share that gift. Now the race to 
which I belong have no other means of obtaining a soul, than by forming, with air individual ofyour 
own, the most intimate union of love." 

Undine has an uncle, Kuhleborn, who is the spirit of a brook, the brook which had cut off the re- 
treat of the knight. It was this uncle who had stolen the fisherman's daughter ; who had brought 
Undine to the island, and who had, by machination in the haunted forest, forced Huldbrand upon 
the peninsula. The wedding having been accomplished, the brook is dried up; and the married pair, 
attended by the priest, make their way to the city where the tournament had been held, and where 
Bertalda and her friends were much alarmed at the long absence of the knight. This lady, who had 
loved him, and who is, in fact, the lost daughter of the fisherman (having been carried safely to a 
distant shore by Kuhleborn, and found and adopted by a Duke) this lady is sadly grieved at the 
marriage of the knight, but feels an unaccountable prepossessiorr in favor of the bride, becomes her 
most intimate friend, and at length goes to live with her at the castle of Ringstetten — much in op- 
position to the wishes of the priest and of Kuhleborn. The disasters of the drama now commence. 
Huldbrand insensibly forgets his love for Undine, and recalls his passion for Bertalda. He is even 
petulant to his bride ; who is aware of all, but utters no reproach. She entreats him, however, to be 
careful not to reproach her when they are crossing a brook, or in any excursion upon the water ; as, 
in such case, her friends the water-spirits, who resent his behaviour, would have power to bear her 
away entirely, and for ever. In a passage down the Danube, however, with Undine and Bertalda, 
he'forgets the caution, and upon a trifling occasion bitterly reproves his gentle bride — for whom he 
still feels a lingering affection. She is thus forced to leave him, and melts into the waters of the 
river. 

Huldbrand returns with Bertalda to castle Ringstetten. His grief, at first violent, settles down at 
length into a tender melancholy, and finally is merged, although not altogether, in a growing passion 
for the fisherman's daughter. He sends for the priest ; who obeys the summons in haste, but re-

fuses to perform the marriage ceremony. He represents that lor many nights previous, Undine had 
appeared to him in a dream, imploring him with deep sighs, and saying — " Ah prevent him, dear 
father ! I am still living ! Ah ! save his life ! Ah ! save his soul !" Huldbrand, however, rejects 
the advice of the priest, and sends to a neighboring monastery for a monk, who promises to do his 
bidding in a few days. 

Meantime, the knight is borne, in a dieam, as if on swans' wings, to a certain spot in the Medi- 
terranean Sea. Here he is held hovering over the water, which becomes perfectly transparent. He 
sees Undine weeping bitterly and in conversation with Kuhleborn. This conversation gives Huld- 
brand to know that Undine still lives, and still retains her soul, although separated for ever from her 
husband — and that, if he should again mairy, it will be her fate and her duty to cause his death, in 
obedience to a law of the water-spit its. Kuhleborn is insisting upon this necessity. He tells Un- 
dine that the knight is about to wed — and reminds her of what she must do. 

" I have not the power," returned Undine with a smile. " Do you not remember 1 I have sealed 
up the fountain securely, not only against mjself, but all of the same race." [This is a fountain in 
the court-yard of Castle Ringstetten, which Undine had caused to be covered up, while she lived 
upon earth, on account of its affording Kuhleborn and other water-spirits who were ill disposed to 
the knight, the means of access to the castle.] 

" Still, should he leave his castle," said Kuhleborn, " or should he once allow the fountain to be 
uncovered, what then 1 for doubtless he thinks there is no great murder in such trifles 1" 

" For that very reason," said Undine, still smiling amid her tears, " for that very reason he is this 
moment hovering in spiiit over the Mediterranean Sea, and dreaming of this voice of warning which 
our conversation affords him. It is for this that I have been studious in disposing the whole vision." 

Notwithstanding all this, however, Huldbrand weds Bertalda. She in the gaiety of her spirit, upon 
the night of the wedding, causes the fountain to be uncovered without the knowledge of the knight, 
•who has never revealed his dream to her. She does this, partly on account of a fancied virtue in the 
water, and partly through an arrogant pleasure in undoing what the first wife had commanded to 
be done. Undine immediately ascends and accomplishes the destruction of the knight. 

This is an exceedingly meagre outline of the leading events of the story ; which, although brief, 
is crowded with incident. Beneath all, there runs a mystic or under-current of meaning, of the 
simplest and most easily intelligible, yet of the most richly philosophical character. From internal 
evidence afforded by the book itself, we gather that the author has deeply suffered from the ills of an 
ill-assorted marriage — and to the bitter reflections induced by these ills, we owe the conception and 
peculiar execution of " Undine." 

In the contrast between the artless, thoughtless, and careless character of Undine before possessing 
a soul, and her serious, enwrapped, and anxious, yet happy condition after possessing it — a condition 
which, with all its multiform cares and disquietudes, she still feels to be preferable to her original 
fate — M. Fouque has beautifully painted the difference between the heart unused to love, and the 
heart which has received its inspiration. 

The jealousies which follow the maniage, arising from the conduct of Bertalda, are the natural 
troubles of love — ^but the persecutions of Kuhleborn and the othei water-spirits, who take umbrage at 
Huldbrand's treatment of his wife, are meant to picture certain difficulties from the interference of 
relations in conjugal matters — difficulties which the author has himself experienced. The warning 
of Undine to Huldbrand — " reproach me not upon the waters, or we part for ever" — is meant to em- 
body the truth that quarrels between man and wife, are seldom or never irremediable unless when 
taking place in the presence of third parties. The second wedding of the knight, with his gradual 
forgetfulness of Undine and Undine's intense giief beneath the waters — are dwelt upon so patheti- 
cally and so passionately^ — that there can be no doubt of the personal opinions of the author on the 
subject of such marriages — no doubt of his deep personal interest in the question. How thrillingly 
are these few and simple words made to convey his belief that the Tnere death of a beloved wife does 
not imply a final separation so complete as to justify an union with another — " The fisherman had 
loved Undine with exceeding tenderness, and it was a doubtful conclusion to his mind, that the 
mere disappearance of his beloved child could be properly viewed as her death !" This is where the 
old man is endeavoring to dissuade the knight from wedding Bertalda. 

We have no hesitation in saying that this portion of the design of the romance — the portion 
•which conveys an under-current of meaning — does not afford the fairest field to the romanticist — 
does not appertain to the higher regions of ideality. Although, in this case, the plan is essentially 
distinct from Allegory, yet it has too close an affinity to that most indefensible species of writing — 
a species whose gross demerits we cannot now pause to examine. That M. Fouque was well aware 
of the disadvantage under which he labored — that he well knew the field he traversed not to be the 
fairest — and that a personal object alone induced him to choose it — we cannot and shall not doubt. 
For the hand of the master is visible in every line of his beautiful fable. " Undine" is a model of 
models, in regard to the high artistical talent which it evinces. We could write volumes in a detail- 
ed commentary upon its various beauties in this respect. Its unity is absolute — its keeping un- 
broken. Yet every minute point of the picture fills and satisfies the eye. Every thing is attended 
to, and nothing is out of time or out of place. 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 173 

We say that some private arid perso;ial design to be fulfilled has thrown M. Fouque upon that 
objectionable under-current of meaning whicii he has so elaborately managed. Yet his high genius 
has nearly succeeded in turning the blemish into a beauty. At all events he has succeeded, in spite 
of a radical defect, in producing what we advisedly consider the finest romance in existence. W^e 
say this with a bitter kind of half-consciousness that only a very few will fully agree with us — yet 
these few are oar all in such matters. They will stand by us in a just opinion. 

Were we to pick outpoints for admiration in Undine, we should pick out the gieater'portion of 
the story. We cannot say whether the novelty of its conception, or the loftiness of its ideality, or its 
intense pathos, or its rigorous simplicity, or that high artistical talent with which all are combined, 
is the parliculai to be chiefly admired. Addressing those who have read the book, we may call at- 
tention to the delicacy and grace of transition from subject to subject — a point which never f^ls to 
tests the power of the writer — as, for example, at page 128, when, for the purposes of the story, it 
becomes necessary that the knight, with Undine and Bertalda, shall proceed down the Danube. An 
ordinary novelist would have here tormented both himself and his readers, in his search for a suffi- 
cient motive for the voyage. But, in connexion with a fable such as Undine, how all-sufficient 
seems the simple motive assigned by Fouque ! — "In this grateful union of friendship and aifection 
winter came and passed away ; and spring, with its foliage of tender green, and its heaven of softest 
blue, succeeded to gladden the hearts of the three inmates of the castle. The season was in harmony 
with their minds, and their minds imparted their own hues to the season. What wonder, then, that 
its storks mid swallows inspired them also with a disposition to travel!" 

Again, we might dwell upon the exquisite management of imagination, vihiclx is so visible in the 
passages where the brooks are water-spirits, and the water-spirits brooks — neither distinctly either. 
What can be more ethereally ideal than the frequent indetermmate glimpses caught of Kuhlebom — 
or than his singular and wild lapses into shower and foaml — or than the evanishing of the white 
wagoner and his white horses into the shrieking and devouring flood "? — or than the gentle melting 
of the passionately-weeping bride into the chrystal waters of the Danube 1 What can be more divine 
than the character of the soul-less Undine 1 — what more august than her transition into the souI« 
possessing wife ] What can be more intensely beautiful than the whole book 1 We calmly think — 
yet cannot help asserting with enthusiasm — that the whole wide range of fictitious literature em- 
braces nothing comparable in loftiness of conception, or in felicity of execution, to those final pas- 
sages of the volume before us which embody the uplifting of the stone from the fount by the order 
of Bertalda, the sorrowful and silent re-advent of Undine, and the rapturous death of Sir Huldbrand 
in the embraces of his spiritual wife. 



Algic Researches ; Comprising Inquiries respecting the Mental Characteristics of the Nmih Ame- 
rican Indians. First Series. Indian Tales and Legends. Two Volumes. By Henry Rowe 
Schoolcraft, Author of a Narrative Journal of Travels to the Sources of the Mississippi ,- Travels 
in the Central Portions of the Mississippi Valley ,- An Expedition to Itasca Lake, etc. Harper 
and Brothers, New York. 

These volumes form the commencement of a singularly interesting and important work — a work 
which has been already too long delayed — and which could not be so well executed, perhaps, by any 
man living as by Mr. Schoolcraft. With a view of aiding in the formation of right opinions in re- 
gard to the origin and mental peculiarities of our aborigines, this gentleman has devoted many years 
and great labor, in discovering and fixing the comprehensive points of their national resemblance, as 
well as the concurring circumstances of their history, and traditions — also in detecting the affinities 
of their languages, and in unveiling the principles of their mythology. He well observes that the 
true period for such inquiry must be limited to the actual existence of the tribes themselves. Many 
of them are already extinct, with the languages they spoke — and one ci the still-existing smaller 
races has lost the use of its vernacular tongue in adopting the English. It is indeed time that tha 
record of facts should be completed by which the aborigines are to be judged. The interest of the 
subject requires no comment. Mr. S. has had the advantage of a long residence in the Indian coun- 
try, and of official intercourse with the tribes. He has obtained new and authentic data ; he has 
found materials for separate observations on the oral tales of the Indians, fictitious and historical; on 
their hieroglyphics, music and poetry ; and on the grammatical structure of their languages, with 
their principles of combination, and the actual condition of their vocabulary. The present work 
embraces the first named topic only — the oral traditions. The other subjects will be hereafter dis- 
cussed. The word " Algic," adopted as a nominative for the series, is derived from " Allcgharry" and 
"Atlantic," and includes, in a generic sense, all that family of tribes who, about the year 1600, were 
found spread out along the Atlantic, between Pamlico Sound and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, extend- 
ing northwest to the Missinipi of Hudson's Bay, and west to the Mississippi — this with some few 
local exceptions. 

The work cannot be too emphatically urged upon public attention.

man, Superintendent of Thug Police, Two Volumes. Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

There exists, in India, and lias there existed for nearly two himdred years, a secret fraternity of 
Assassins, called Thugs, and composed of many thousand individuals, united in the bonds of a most 
bloody and singular superstition — a fraternity -which practices the boldest robbery and the most 
atrocious murder as the ordinary means of subsistence — regarding them not as crime but as deeds 
of high merit, especially acceptable in the eyes of its tutelar Deity. The measures of the society have, 
moreover, been concerted and executed with a skill so consummate, that, until lately, all efforts have 
failed at putting it down. It has been long known that such a body actually flourished — but we 
have had hitherto verj' little of definite or accessible information respecting it. These volumes 
fully remedy the evil. They are a compilation from a work published in Calcutta, in 1836, entitled 
" Ramaseana, or a Vocabulary of the peculiar Language used by the Thugs, with an Introduction 
and Appendix, descriptive of the System pursued by that Fraternity, and of the Measures adopted 
by the Supreme Government of India for its Suppression."

Letters from tJie late Queen Caroline, the Princess Charlotte, and from Various Other Distin- 
guished Persons, Edited by John Gait, Esq. Tivo Volumes. Lea and Blanchard, Philadel- 
phia. 

The first portion of this Diary was rendered moie notorious, and certainly of more consequence, 
than it would otherwise have been, by a variety of virulent attacks upon its general pretensions, and 
especially upon its credibility, by a legion of British reviewers, among whom Lord Brougham ren- 
dered himself not a little conspicuous. It may be well doubted, however, if any or if all of the Phi- 
lippics by which the book has been assailed, have succeeded in overthrowing it, so far as regards the 
more essential matters of fact of which it takes cognizance. It may even be questioned whether, 
with some reservation. Queen Caroline is not here truly depicted; and we should by no means 
wonder if the work were hereafter gravely referred to as affording the clearest light in respect to her 
character. 



Practical Lessons in Floiver Painting, being a Series of Progressive Studies, principally from 
Nature. By James Acherman. Thomas, Cowperthwaite and Co. Philadelphia. 

The progressive exercises in this book are well arranged. We have, first, outlines and shaded 
portions of stems ; then the various tints of green leaves ; then the petals colored in gradation, and 
accompanied with the plainest instructions in regard to the mixing of the colors, etc. — then single 
flowers, with leaves and petals — and, in the last place, entire groups of exquisite loveliness. The 
work is in duplicate — each picture being given colored and uncolored. We heartily recommend it 
to public attention, as decidedly the best elementary book on Flower Painting to be met with in 
America. In saying this we make no exception in favor of imported English publications — for Mr. 
Ackerman's " Lessons" are much superior to the original ones of Andrews in point of delicate 
execution. The latter work was published by Tilt of Cheapside ; and various attempts have been 
made in New York, and elsewhere, to get up a republication; all of which have failed, until this of 
Mr. Ackerman's. Mr. A. no doubt owes his success, in part, to his being the lithographer of his 
own flowers — that is to say, he draws them himself on stone, as well as colors them — the proper fill- 
ing in of the shades in the drawing being an important point. There can be no question, however, 
that as regards meie coloring, also, better work is done at Mr. A.'s rooms (corner of Market and 
Seventh streets) than at any similar establishmest in this countiy. 



Prepared Notices of " Marryatt's Diary," of " Hyperion," of the " Naval Foundling," of " J ack

MISTER RICHARD DODDICOMBE, 

A SKETCH, 

BY WIXLIAM E. BURTON, 

Illustrating a Mezzotint Engraving on Steel, by Sartain, after a Celebrated Picture by Buss, of 
THE MUSICAL BORE. 



Mister Richarb Doddicombe is a portly gentleman of some fifty years experience amongst the 
flats and sharps of this chromatic world. He is a bachelor, '' free from all incumbrances, and pos- 
sessed of a genteel independency," as the old gentlemen say when they advertise for wives, A 
phrenologist might express surprise at the extraordinary development of the organs of time and 
tune, in the bumpital region of Mr. Doddicombe's caput, were he unacquainted with the gentleman's 
devotion to the musical science — but the slightest intimacy would convince the scullogist that the- 
organs in question ought to form the chiefest portion of Mr. D.'s cranium — positive mountains 
amongst the ant hills thrown up by the other propensities affecting his brain pan — to be in corres- 
ponding value to the super-eminent afiection displayed in his love towards " a concord of sweet 
sounds." 

When Richard " was a little chubby boy," he one day strolled far from his father's residence, ear- 
led by sounds emanating from a cracked clarinet played upon by a broken-winded Scotchman, who was 
blind of one eye, and remarkably well dimpled with varioloid. The giunts of this Caledonian's 
bagpipe found a ready vibration in the chords of Dickey's heart-strings; he felt the influence of mu- 
sic on his soul, and determined to devote his future life to the study of the gentle science. Return- 
ing home, he stole a sixpence from his father's till, and bought the best imitation of the blind man's 
clarinet procuiable in the neighborhood — a long wooden whistle, with four holes — on which be per* 
severingly practised till something like the ghost of a tune rewarded his laborious exertions. In the 
very outset of his musical career, he drove a maiden aunt from the home of his ancestors by the 
vile squeakings that he daily made; she took offence at his mother's encouragement of her child's 
display, and dying shortly afterwards, left her fortune to a toad-eating nephew — a maker of ladies* 
shoes. This affair proved but " a prologue to a most dreadful tragedy to come." 

Years rolled on ; Dickey obtained a flute, and puffed the beauties of Yankee Doodle and RoMor 
Adair, and perpetrated other easy lessons in two sharps without making more than a dozen flat Esls- 
yei. T. — NO. IV. H

takes. When he entered his teens, he obtained a vioUn, and scraped an acquaintance with a band 
of juvenile fiddlers, who harmoniously passed their evenings in discordant squeakings, and killed 
time pleasantly, although they did not know how to beat it. 

Dickey Doddicombe soon longed for stronger food ; " rubbing the hair of the horse against the 
bowels of the cat" was too quiet an exercise for the musical fury raging in his breast. The per- 
formances of a canal boatman, who blowed "Southern breezes" and "Loud roared the dreadful 
thunder" on an old revolutionarj^ trumpet, determined Dickey to go his death on brazen tubes, and 
a small curly instrument was obtained from a charcoal man, who gladly received a hoin of liquor in 
exchange. Dickey soon drove his parents to the verge of madness by the violence of his tootle- 
tooing; arguments were used in vain ; in spite of the excess of his angry mother's tattle, the head- 
strong boy continued to tootle. Old Doddicombe was a quiet man, and his nervous system fell be- 
fore the daily blowing-up of his wife and the constant blowing-out of his son. He took to liquor ; 
he was in a measure compelled to go to the tavern for a little peace, because he was not allowed a 
bar's rest at home. His trade fell off, and this circumstance broke the old gentleman's heart ; so, 
when his business went to the devil, he died directly — for he was a plain unsophisticated tradesman, 
wishing only to follow Ms bw-mess, without any flourish of trumpets. 

Dickey followed his father's body to the grave with an aching heart, for he knew his deficieircy, 
and lamented, as he walked in the funereal throng, that he was unable to play the Dead March in 
Saul upon the horn, as a fitting tribute to the melancholy occasion. 

The musical mania raged with additional violence in Dickey's bosom as he became intimate with 
the science, and was able to relieve the monotony of his solitary solos by bearing a part in the mu- 
sical meetings of his neighbors. His education had been sadly neglected for the attainment of this 
one great end. "What was Gieek in comparison to the gamut ] syntax to a sinfonia 1 philosophy 
to a fugue movement ? Seneca's wisdom to a sonata's workings 1 or the history of Rome to the ex- 
ecution of a rondo "? Nothing. The seven notes were his seven sciences of heavenly construction — 
the diatonic scale formed his Jacob's ladder for heavenly visitation — and the stave was a five-barred 
gate that locked Elysium ; flats, sharps, and naturals, were his every-day acquaintances, and he 
sluried them over, or held on to them, according to their respective value in the scale of his enjoy- 
ment. 

Mrs. Doddicombe had a desire to be called grandma ; she suggested to Dickey that the name of 
Doddicombe ought to be perpetuated, and hinted at the propriety of wedlock. He confessed that he 
had no objection to a matrimonial duett, and the anxious parent undertook to p; ', ct his partner. — 
Dickey was invited to a musical soiree at the house of Miss Diana Dulcet, w';iu was barely twentj'- 
five years of age, with a hairdsome fortune in her own right. But Dickey affronted her at their first 
meeting ; tbe young lady was proud of her performance on the piano-forte, and loved to show off 
her skill in the presence of her friends. Dickey wished to exhibit his musical knowledge also, and, 
annoyed at the lady's perseverance, rudely told her that she had better leave off, for she was only 
exposing her ignoiance — taking his horn from his pocket, he blew a blast so long and loud and 
dread, that the ladies ran shrieking from the room. Dickey only ceased from his solo at the press- 
ing importunity of the footman, who gave him his hat and pointed to the door. 

Dickey went in for fortissimo passages ; as the Hoosier said on a similar occasion, " he guessed he 
war'nt up to their figger in the skientifics, but he'd swaller his shadder if he couldn't beat 'em on 
the loud." As Dickey progressed in his music, the trumpet and the bugle became favorite instru- 
ments ; and a rattle on the double drum gave a relish to the day's amusement. Then, like Eve, h&amp; 
was seduced by a serpent, and growled most horrible music on the bassoon in perfect ecstacy. His 
mother " never could abide" the serpent; its Freischutzian tones were unearthly in the old lady's 
ears, and seemed to fret her bowels into fiddle strings, and positively turn hei inside out, as the old 
lady declared just before her death, which occurrence was doubtless hastened by the violence of her 
snakephobia. 

If my readers have ever seen Signer de Big-knees, or Big- nose, I forget whicli is the proper pro- 
nunciation of his name, in the character of a director of an orchestra, dressed in a long morning 
gown, with a cap on his head, made of music paper, with the air of" All round my hat" written on 
it, he can form some idea of the musical fervor which affected my poor friend Doddicombe, as he 
turned the gentle summer of his life, and fell into its autumn path. He quarrelled with his best 
fiiend because he pleasantly denominated a valve trumpet a sojt of a young trombone. He fought 
a duel with a parson, for defending the use of consecutive sevenths. He was taken to jail for jump- 
ing from the boxes of a theatre into the orchestra, and assaulting a drummer who was mamng the 
effect of an overture by his injudicious thumpings. In his serenades, he was peculiarly unfortunate ; 
once, he was taken up by the watchman for refusing to account for the j;ossession of a huge bass 
viol, which he was hauling to the place of his devoirs. Another time, on a summer's midnight, he 
placed himself under the window of an old German, who, unable to sleep from the visitation of count- 
less hosts of midnight vermin, had risen from his bed to indulge in vengeful slaughter. At that mo- 
ment, Dickey tuned his bassoon, and growled foith " Still so gently o'er me stealing;" the German 
thought the appositeness of the tune a premeditated insult ; the window was quietly opened, and a

bucket of foul water and half a dozeii flower pots were thrown upon the head of the innocent sere- 
nader. 

Dickey wears a likeness of Paganini round his neck, supported by a single string of catgut — the 
string on which the incompaiable maestro played his solo before the emperor of Germany. Poor 
Doddicombe has been lately prosecuted for slander ; he whispered, with a serious face, the important 
fact that John Smith had better stay at home and study, for he had a faulty method of fingering! 
The whisperee repeated the observation to a third person, with a slight difference, and by next day, 
John Smith was denounced as a pickpocket, on the authority of Mister Richard Doddicombe. 

Dickey's devotion to harmony has sadly reduced his means of life ; he has sold his houses to buy 
horns, and his fields (o pay for fiddles ; his bank notes have been turned into music paper, and sub- 
stantial wealth has vanished in thin air and empty sound. He has been turned out of endless lodg- 
ings for midnight practisings — and committed to countless watch-houses and jails as a nuisance and 
a noisy disturber of the peace — but the love of music cannot be quenched within him, for each suc- 
ceeding opposition serves but to tighten his strings and produce severer tones. 

Dickey felt that he was descending the hill, with grim poverty staring him in his face, which now 
began to assume somewhat of the sere and yellow leaf. He looked around for the means of deliver- 
ance, and cast his eyes upon the peison and purse of an elderly spinster, Miss Timkins, who had 
graciously bestowed her praises upon the peiformances of our hero. He popped the question, and 
was accepted ; the day was fixed — and, as if to crown the glorious event, Dickey was offered a very 
profitable engagement at a series of moi-ning concerts, about to be given by several eminent profes- 
sors, under the most fashionable auspices. On the night preceding the day appointed for his mar- 
riage, Doddicombe passed the evening with his beloved, atrd, after two innocent glasses of weak gill 
and water, returned home to his garret, to dream of future wealth and happiness. But the piece of 
music wherein he most expected to shine at the first concert of the season, met his eye ; he resolved 
to go over it 07ice before he went to bed — the trombone was seized, and the music executed to the 
performer's entire delight. Again and again, the piece was repeated — the hours flew rapidly away — 
the lodgers swore at the infernal noise that prohibited all sleep — and the landlord cursed the musi- 
cianer who paid his rent in such uncuirent notes. The clock had travelled far into the " wee sma' 
hours ayont the twal'," when the landlord, a pains-taking tailor, who plied a weary needle for six- 
teen hours out of the twenty-four — and his consumptive wife, worn out for want of rest by the con- 
tinuous tromboning of our Dickey — and a squalling infant, half delirious from its loss of sleep — 
burst into Doddicombe's room, and found him straining eyes and lungs over the Hailstone Chorus. 
Explanations were useless; he ordered the intruders to quit his room; the tailor waxed valorous, 
backed by the remonstrances of the other lodgers who had gathered round the scene of action — par- 
ticularly a sour old lady who dwelt in the third floor back, and seemed to have a spite agaiirst poor 
Dickey because he was going to be married. 

" For 'evvin's sake, Mister Doddicombe, give over tiumpetising at this 'ere 'our. My other lodg- 
ers is raving. The back garret is swearing awful, and the parlors has broke the bell ropes. My 
blessed babby is screaming like a dear little toad in convulsions, and the methodisses opposite are a 
pouring out all sorts o' brimstone curses on us. You know you driv' away my first floor, and the 
third floor back says that it was you as killed the second floor front — the nervous old lady as died 
last week for want o' sleep. Do leave your blowing ; there's a dead baker now in the next house, 
and how would you like, if you was stiff and silent, to be disturbed jest afore your herring by them 
blowed horns." 

Dickej' insisted upon his right to play when and where he pleased ; the tailor gave him warning 
to quit ; Dickey called him a ninth part of humanity, and played in derision the air of " Go to the 
devil and shake yourself." The old maid opened the street door, and let in the watchman — Dickey 
knocked him down wit'i his trombone, and was eventually dragged to the watch-house by the united 
force of fifteen watchmen, the tailor, the tailor's wife, and the old maid. The officer of the watch, 
infuriated at Dickey's repeated offences, locked him up for the balance of the night. In the morn- 
ing, he was fined for the assault, and in default of payment, for Dickey was bare of the needful, 
committed to jail for a month. 

The marriage was of course broken off. His intended declined a connection with a jail bird ; and 
the concerts took place without Dickey's assistance. The poor fellow is now suffering the pangs of 
poverty and misery ; he occasionally earns a few dollars by his musical abilities ; but his deficiency 
in the scientific principles of the art prevents him from holding a lucrative or respectable situation. 
He has run through a whole gamut of garrets in his residential career, and though living in alt, de- 
clares that he never expected to descend so low in the scale of human existence. 



THE WHITE MOUNTAIN LEGEND

tYyi&amp;ii.~lVinthrop''s Journal, 



Oj!f , red man, on ! to where yon pines 

Their giant forms uprear ! 
On ! to the airy mountain height ! 

What ! quakes thy heart with fear ? 
Thou — whose bright eye hath looked on death, 

Whose proud Hp curled in scorn. 
While, 'midst thy pale-faced foes, in chains 

And mockery, thou wast borne ! 

In mockery thou wast borne ! and yet 

Thy firm heart beat as free 
As when, upon thy native hills, 

It throbbed with liberty ! 
And now thine eye is powerless. 

Thine arm is as the dead ; 
Thy face, on yonder summit fixed^ 

Is blanched, as if with dread ! 

'Tis blanched, as if with dread ! oh say 

Can that heart ever fail ] 
It feared not man, and shall it faint. 

When Fancy's doubts assail 1 
On, red man, on ! our way lies on^ 

Where yonder craggy height 
Hangs o'er the torrents rocky bed. 

Dark as the womb of night ! 

Dark as the womb of night, and deep. 

And rapid is its tide ; 
And down its rushing bosom's sweep 

The sUmy adders glide. 
And only when the lightning's flash 

Darts o'er that dismal stream, 
Shines there upon its cheerless breast. 

One solitary gleam ! 

One solitary gleam ! aye, see 

Yon rising murky cloud ! 
And hark ! how echoes through the rocks 

The thunder pealing loud ! 
Mark, how upon that dreary lake 

Reflects the meteor flash, 
While, swollen with sudden torrents now, 

Its raging waters dash ! 



Its 1 aging waters dash ! yet on 

To where the sheltering cave. 
On yonder mountain's summit opes 

A home, while tempests rave ! 
Haste thither, then ! yet even now, 

The glorious sun once more 
Is fringing that dark cloud with gold ! 

Almost the storm is o'er ! 

Almost the storm is o'er — and see 

Where, in the distant east, 
The rainbow flings its changing arch ; — 

And now, the rain hath ceased ! 
Yet thy fierce eye regards it not. 

Unmindful is thine ear. 
What chains thee, led man ! to that spot 1 

Say! wherefore dost thou fearl 

Wherefore do I fear ? ask'st thou? — 

On yonder frowning height 
Is throned the Spirit, before whom 

The red man veils his sight ! 
And ne'er upon that sacred rock 

May I piesume to stand ! 
For, stranger ! Heaven's avenging bolts 

Are wielded by His hand ! 

They're wielded by His hand ! he sits 

In lofty grandeur where 
The thunder-clouds like chariots roll. 

And swift-winged lightnings glare : 
And woe befal the heart and hand 

Which that dread presence brave ! 
No, stranger, no ! tempt not His wrath ! 

That lake were else thy grave ! 

That lake were sure thy grave, if thou 

Should'st madly dare His power ! 
Then turn, nor prove the might of Him 

Whose frowns around us lower ! — 
Turn, red man, if you will ! my course 

Is o'er yon craggy height ; 
There, where the lake rolls sullenly, 

Dark as the womb of night !

To meet another foe \—Camp. 



THE THREE BATTLES. 

First. — SpoILI^;G a Cruise, or the Capture of the Gtterriere. 

" Fire ! in the main-top, 
Fire ! in the bow, 
Fire ! on the gun-deck, 
Fire ! down below." 

Once more in motion upon her favorite element — i, e, salt water — and under the command of her 
former commander, the gallant Hull — Old Ironsides, on the second of August, 1812, bade goodnight 
to the high lands of Massachusetts bay, and proceeded on a cruize. Hugging the land of her birth, 
she stood to the northward until the Bay of Fundy spread out its ample bosom to receive her; but 
finding nothing there to cope with, she stood boldly out to the eastward, and waved her striped bunt- 
ing along the shores of the Isle of Sables, and before the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Having burnt 
two insignificant prizes there, she continued on her course, and on the morning of the 15th, made 
five sail, one of which was a sloop of war. 

" Crack on sail, sir," said captain Hull to the first lieutenant, as he stood on the windward horse- 
block, scanning the stranger with his glass. 

, „ " Aye, aye, sir !" replied the gallant Morris, and soon the old ship spread out her fair-weather sails 
to the favorable wind, and bowled along in chase. 

" She has set one of her prizes on fire !" said captain Hull, stamping his foot on the horseblock. 

" Then she will have the less prize money, and be d d to her !" said the old signal quarter 

master, in a gruff" tone, to the signal midshipman, as he took another squint at his Britannic majes- 
ty's cruizer. 

" I say. Jack," said a tall Marbleheader, as he leaned over the head rail, " that fellow would make 
a good whaleman, if you could only get his lubberly topmasts _y?rf(Zerf, and tip his old iron overboard. 
A lick of coal tar wouldn't hurt his bends, and a bright streak might add a little to his appearance 
on a Sunday morning !" 

" Silence, forward !" thundered the first lieutenant. " Master's mate of the forecastle, this is a 
ship of war, sir." 

" Down with you, forward !" said the master's mate, jumping down as though he had put his foot 
in a bucket of hot water. " Lie close, you landlubbers, this is no whaleman !" 

" Old Switchell is at it again !"* whispered one of the quarter masters to his neighbor. " I won- 
der why he don't swallow a breaker of molasses, and then hoist in water at his leisure ; that infer- 
nal steward of his has kept his teaspoon agoing since seven bells, and bum me, if it hasn't put me 
in mind of splicing the mainbrace with a real nor'-wester '." 

" I say, John Wilson, let me kiss your monkey, you close-fisted son of a catgut scraper !" said the 

* Captain Hull was at this time a robust man, in full health, and having made a pretty severe at- 
tack upon salt codfish the day previous, he drank a great quantity of molasses and water during the 
day. The sailors, ever ready to notice the most minute peculiarities in their superiors, immediately 
named him " Old Switchell," and by this name he is known to the old men of war's men, to this 
day.

captain of the head, to an old tar who generally kept a wee drop in his locker, for sore eyes and the 
rheumatiz, as he often termed it. 

" You be blasted !" replied the indignant Mr. Wilson. " Kiss the purser's bull,* if you like, or 
take a pull at the halliards with Old Switchell — molasses and water is good enough for a gentleman's 
son !" And a smothered laugh and a fresh plug of pig-tail ended the colloquy. The next moment 
a round shot cut the captain of the head in two, and produced from the aforesaid Mr. Wilson the 
piteous exclamation of — 

" Hello ! No, 1 has stopped his mess ! My eyes ! that was a close shave !" 

The body was immediately hove into the sea, and a bucket or two of water washed all traces of 
the unfortunate captain of the head from the upper world. 

The sloop of war being to windward, the Constitution changed her course, and overhauled an 
English merchantman, already a prize to an American privateer. A brig was next chased to leeward, 
which proved to be an American with a prize crew on board. She was recaptured, and sent in. The 
remainder of the vessels escaped. Having run up as far as his instiuctions permitted him, captain 
Hull came about, and proceeded to the southward ; and on the 19th, at two, P. M. the cry of" Sail 
O !" roused the officers from the mess table, and assembled all hands on the spar deck. The sail 
was soon dimly seen to leeward, bearing E. S. E., but her character could not be discovered. The 
Constitution immediately made sail in chase, and at six bells the stranger was ascertained to be a 
ship. In a short half hour, her rows of teeth were discovered, and no doubt was enteitained of her 
being an enemy's frigate. The Constitution still kept on her course until she was within a league 
of the frigate to leeward, when she began to shorten sail. The enemy had now laid his maintopsaii 
aback, and appeared to be Vi-aiting for the frigate to come down, with every thing ready to engage. 
Perceiving that there was a chance for a fight at last, upon something like even terras, captain Hull 
proceeded to make his preparations vvith the greatest coolness and deUberation. The Constitution, 
therefore, furled her light sails, double-reefed her topsails, hauled up the courses, sent down her royal 
yards, and prepared her decks for action. At the first tap of the drum, the crew came pouring up 
to muster, and ere the drummers had beaten the call, they stood in silence at their guns. At five, 
P. M., the chase hoisted three English ensigns, and opened her fire at long shot, waring several 
times to rake and to avoid a raking in return. The Constitution still came down in death-like si- 
lence, yawing occasionally, to baulk the English commander in his rakish intentions, and heaving 
ahead like her inimitable self alone. At six, the enemy, who seemed to be a very gentlemanly fel- 
low, bore up, and ran off under his three topsails and jib, with the wind on his quarter, which in 
plain English meant, as one of the captains of the guns whispered to the first spunger — " Come 
alongside as quick as you please, and take it yard-arm and yard-arm, and be d d to you !" 

At a little after six, the bows of Old Ironsides began to double on the quarter of the English ship, 
and as she came full upon her, at pistol shot distance, captain Hull, who had stood, trumpet in hand, 
upon the horseblock, waiting for the favorable moment, sprang upon deck and gave the long expect- 
ed order — " Fire ! !" 

At the word, the entire broad-side went off as one gun, and careened the Constitution to her bear- 
ings. It was a broadside of destruction — its shot pierced the enemy through and through, and car- 
ried away his mizzenmast, while captain Hull roared through his trumpet — 

" Well done, my lads, you have made a brig of her !" 

" You have carried away a streak of copper, sir," said an old tar, pointing to an enormous rent in 
the captain's nankin tights with one hand, and touching his hat with the other. 

"Ha!" said Hull, examining his damaged unmentionables, "'tis true thestufl'has given way, but 
never mind, burnt powder will soon color every thing. Give them another royal salute, jny boys." 

For thirty minutes, one incessant roar of artillery filled the ears of the combattants. A vast field 
of white smoke spread upon the face of the waters to leeward, and the hollow waves echoed mourn- 
fully to the thmrder speaking gun. 

The frigate now passed slowly ahead, keeping up an unmitigated fire, and luiTed short around the 
Englishman's bows, to prevent being raked. In performing this manoeuvre, the ship shot into the 
wind, got sternway upon her, and backed on to her antagonist. The cabin of the Constitution now 
caught fire from the close explosion of the forward guns of the enemy. The exertions of lieutenant 
B. V. Hoffman, who commanded that division, however, soon restored order, and the gun of the 
enemy that had caused the injury and threatened to do still greater damage was disabled and silen- 
ced. As the vessels touched, the sound of bugles and the cry of, " First division of boarders, away!" 
issued from the smoke that covered each vessel, and the heavy cannon had an opportunity to cool 
awhile. 

The English mustered at the bows, while the Americans assembled at the taffrail. The musketry 
now was dreadful. Lieutenant Morris was shot through the body, but maintained his post ; the bul- 
let having fortunately missed his vitals. Sailing master Almy was wounded in the shoulder ; and 
lieutenant Bush, the marine officer, having received a bullet in the head, fell upon his face and died 
with the cry of encouragement upon his lips. The English suffered the most, however, by the fire.

THE PAIR SHAKER.

It being found impossible for either party to board in the presence of such a fire, and during the 
continuance of the heavy sea, the sails were filled. As the frigate shot ahead, the foremast of the 
enemy fell by the board. 

" Huzza !" said captain Hull, " we have made a sloop of her, my boys !" 

At this moment, down came the mainmast of the Gueniere with a tremendous crash, and she lay 
a helpless wreck, wallowing in the trough of the encrimsoned sea. A cock that had been knocked 
out of his coop by a shot, now fle\iLinto the mizzcn rigging, and crowed like a bantam on his dung- 
hill. It was the cry of victory, and vvas followed by three loud huzzas from the Constitution's crew. 

The conqueror now ran oif a short distance, secured her masts, rove new ligging, and wiped her 
bloody decks. At seven, she wore round, and took a favorable position for raking. The enemy, 
having had suflicient amusement for one afternoon, lowered a jack that had been kept flying on the 
stump of the mizzenmast, and Old Ironsides' victory was complete. 

An ofiicer was now sent on board the prize, who returned immediately and reported her to be His 
Britannic Majesty's ship Guerricre, of thirty-eight guns, captain Dacres. The Constitution, having 
put a prize-master and crew on board, hovered around her during the night. The next morning, the 
prize ofticer having declared the Guerrierc to be in a sinking condition, the prisoners were removed 
and the piize crew recalled. At three, P. M., captain Hull Oidcred the wreck of the beautiful frigate 
to be set on fire, and in a quarter of an hour, a bright flash lit up the heavens — an awful roar rang 
along the billows — a mighty cloud of impenetrable smoke slowly moved along the ocean, and when 
the evening sun looked down upon the clear waters, nothing was to be seen of the noble cruizer but 
black and bubbling fragments dancing upon their waves. 

The Constitution, having her decks lumbered with wounded prisoners, shaped her course for the 
southward ; and on the SOth of August, stood up Boston harbor, with the cross of England trailing 
beneath the stars and the stripes, and anchored off Long wharf amid the ringing of bells, the firing 
of cannon, and the wild huzzas of assembled thousands. 

Such was the battle that told to the astonished world that the lion was no longer the master of 
the ocean. The whole nation was electrified at the result — the old doubters doubted no longer — 
tories hung their heads in shame, and a generous people arose like one man to do honor to the brave 
of their native land. Captain Hull and his oflScers were feasted and toasted — services of plate, and 
freedoms of cities in gold boxes, were showered upon the captors from all quarters — the name of Old 
Ironsides became the watchword of the nation, and a passport to every society ; and while the brave 
tars, from the lofty yards, raised the loud huzza in honor of the victorious Hull, they forgot not to 
add another to the memory of the absent and wounded Morris.

TBAJfSLATED FROM THE FREJVCH. 



[Continued from page 134.] 

TRIP TO R E N N E S . 

■; Tax letter which made Hypolite Royer Collard so happy, was hi tenor as follows : 

Sir — It is veiy bad in me to have read your letter, and worse indeed to answer it. In fact, I con- 
thided not to write to you, and to give your letter to my mother. But I thought this might have a 
aad result, and upon reflection, I preferred sending you this letter, to beg of you not to write to me 
again. You say you love me, sir, yet you have never spoken to me, and cannot know whether I 
•ain one to be loved. Can it be true that one may fall in love at first sight, as my cousin tells me, 
'^ho calls it " a strolie of lightning?" Ny mother's seivant, old Marion, who once lived three years 
in Paris, where she was a mantuamaker, has often told me of a young man, who lost his senses the 
Srst time he saw her. But I never believed that. I also know, sir, — because I have heard it men- 
tioned since my return to Rennes, — that you are a man of talent, and already celebrated. When, 
they said that before me, I could not help blushing, and nevertheless, I confess, it gave me pleasure. 
It is very wrong for mc to write you in this way, for I was going to reproach you, and yet I know 
not why I had not the courage to do it. That which you have written me, has upset all my ideas, 
^iid I have since felt an uneasiness for which I cannot account, for I am not sick. I have told every 
thing to Marion, who ought to know a great deal, for she is very old, and she says that it is love. I 
am sure it is not, and the only reason that I write to you is because Marion thought it bettei to do 
so. She said that I could do no better, because you v/ould be sure to find out where I was, and if 
you loved me truly, as you say, you v/ould be a much better match for me than our neighbors, who 
are all country gentlemen, who talk of nothing but hunting and horses, which is very wearisome to 
a young lady. It is Marion who says this, and she ought to know belter than I do. If then you 
■wish to see me again, you have only to come and pass the winter at Rennes, where I am going to 
•appear for the first time, for I have just come out of the convent. 
! have the honoi to be your humble seivant, 

Elise de Clebig^'t, at the Chateau of Villensa. 

This Jetier appeared to Royer Collard the very sublime of stupidity. He perused it ten times 
•■with scrupulous attention ; he gravely weighed every syllable, and attached less importance to what 
she actually said, than what she meant to say. Beneath the awkward phraseology of a school-girl, 
he thought he perceived a germ of corruption, which he promised himself ere long to fructify. — 
There, wheie another man would have seen nothing but a desperate barrenness of mind, he disco- 
vered a soil, virgin as yet, but where pleasure would ere long reap a gloiious harvest. 

Elise Clebigny, thought the libertine, has a soul which knows not its own powers. Where could 
she find expressions to develope the mysteries of her heart, which as yet are as unknown to herself 
as to others ? The convent has transformed this woman of powerful mind, and formed for pleasure, 
into a fair statue. But let Pygmalion come, the statue will breathe — little by little — this delicious 
-snow shall melt beneath a kiss ! Those hands, accustomed to count devoutly the beads of the rosa- 
ly, will tremble with delight at the touch of anotlier hand. That voice, which thus far has only re- 
peated, morning and evening, the prayers of the Missal, will murmur low words, all confused and 
iningled with ardent sighs ; desire will smooth those rosy lips ; and that superb eye, now calm and 
clear as the blue of heaven, which it seems to reflect, will shoot forth the humid ray of pleasure. 

Perhaps the libeitine was right. If the letter of Elise de Clebigny betrayed in its expressions an 
incredible ignorance of customs and things, yet was it no less the proof of a certain boldness of will. 
In this letter there was innocence, but no modesty. With a marvellous sagacity, peculiar to fi-ee 
livers, Royer Collard perceived immediately that the simplicity of Elise de Clebigny was not that of 
viJftue, but of vice. Vice hath its simplicity, so long as it remains inexperienced. Royer Collard, 



THE INFERNAL BOX. 183 

who always undertook what he termed an affair of business, with all the coolness of a speculator, 
satisfactorily explained to himself the cause of such precocious evil, by referring to the combined in- 
fluence of the cousin with heu " strokes of lighiTiing," and the chambermaid, who had been three 
years in a milliner's shop. 

I have already told you that Elise do Clebigny was an admirable creature. " It would be agree- 
able," thought the libertine, " to fashion such a mind, to be its first master, and to receive its firs 
sighs. The lot is cast — I go to Rennes — to-morrow night, I pass the Rubicon." By the Rubicon, 
Royer Collard meant the diligence of Lafitte and Caillard. 

That evening he appeared in the Infernal Box. 

" You perceive," said he, after having read the letter of Elise, " that my affairs are in a good 
train !" 

" And you purpose to go to Rennes 1" inquired Romieu. 

" I shall go to Ki'nnes !" 

" r faith ! the Utile girl is worth the trouble — and if he does not go, I will go !" cried the viscount. 

'• Stop, if you please — this affair belongs to me only !" 

Three days after receiving the letter of Elise, Royer Collard was at Rennes. But in vain he went 
from saloon to saloon, he could never meet with Mademoiselle de Clebigny. All those of whom he 
inquired whether they knew Madame de Clebigny, or the Chateau of Villensa, replied that they had 
never heard tell either of one or the other. ' Strange suspicions began to perplex the libertine. If 
his vanity spake aloud to him, saying that he, Royer Collard, could not have been the sport of a 
young girl, his conscience immediately replied thus to his vanity — "Hypolite Royei Collard has 
gained nought but the expense of the trip." 

One evening, at a ball, Royer Collard was sadly seated in the most obscure corner of the room 
His countenance was overcast. That evening, the libertine had not the victorious and pioud air 
which was habitual to him. He spoke almost in a low voice, and with a tone of modesty altogether 
unusual, so that they said — " What ails the doctor to-night "? Has he lost at ecarte 1 Has he, by 
any impossibility, met with a cruel fair one 1 — or is he engaged in the investigation of some new 
theoxy in medicine 1 No, indeed — he has won a hundred louis from the prefect, and driven to bay, 
they say, the virtue of Madame de Clery — the virtue which they pretended was impregnable — his 
last medical treatment has had astonishing effects. Happy dandy, and still more happy doctor ! He 
destroys without remorse the honor of married men, and cures all the sick !" 

" What is the matter, then 1" 

" Really, I don't know !" 

But Royer Collard paid no attention to the conversation going on around him. He thought but 
little of the prefect, for whom he cared but little, nor of the virtue of Madame de Clery, nor of the 
health of his patients, who, however, were none the worse for it. The libertine was thinking of Ro- 
mieu and the Infernal Box. He discerned in the horizon a storm approaching, which threatened to 
overwhelm him with a deluge of sarcastic wit. 

" Parbleu !" exclaimed he, " I have been fooled, like a mere scholar ! At home it would not have 
been so bad — but a hundred leagues for this ! If Romieu should hear of this I am a dead man — 
nothing to do but turn hermit !" 

As he spoke thus, he heard pronounced near him the name of Madame de Clebigny, He turned 
about quickly. 

'' Sir," said a man of advanced age, to another man superbly dressed in a suit of black, no less 
grave than his countenance — " Sir, Madame de Clebigny requests me to present her compliments — 
she ventures to hope that you will pass a few months of the summer at the Chateau of Villensa." 

" Sir," replied the black dress, " I am grateful for the invitation of Madame de Clebigny, and if 
the important interests with which I am charged permit, I shall avail myself of her kind offer." 

Royer Collard arose. " Gentlemen," said he, approaching them, " I beg pardon for interrupting 
you, but you have just been speaking of Madame de Clebigny, and I am extremely anxious to know 
what causes have deprived us, of the pleasure of seeing her this winter at Rennes." 

" What, sir ! do you not know that she has lost her aunt, the Canoness 1" replied the black dress 
" I am the more chagrined, because her daughter, who is related to me through the Montgiberts, but 
for this melancholy occurrence, would have made her first appearance, this 3^ear, in the fashionable 
w^orld. A charming young lady — do you know her V 

" Yes, sir." 

" A perfect treasure ! — her mother has educated her in the pure principles of our holy religion I 
An angel, sir, who perhaps has not spoken to ten men in the course of her life !" 

" And does she still reside at Villensa V 

" She still lives there, sir." And with this, the black dress bowed, and disappeared with his friend. 

Rover Collard could with difficulty contain bis joy. At the very moment in which he believed 
himself the victim of the most horrible mystification, a happy chance restored to him the light of tri- 
fling in his accustomed manner. The free liver leturned to his house, and passed a part of the night 
in imagining what means would be most successful to obtain an interview with Matlemoiselle de 
Clebigny. After much meditation, he hit upon a plan which appeared to him sublime in every par-

ticular, and which consisted in compromising his victim in such a manner that, placed between the 
loss of reputation or the loss of her honor, she would be forced to choose pleasure without danger, 
rather than virtue without profit. Having airanged this, he went to sleep with the calm content of 
a robber who had made a good day's work. 

The next day, he arose early, to commence the undertaking — but in this world we must calculate 
upon unforeseen accidents. At the very moment i&gt;n which he was ready to enter upon the cam- 
paign, Hypolite Royer Collard received an urgent letter, which forced him to set out immediately 
for Paris. 



RETALIATION. 

The business which had so unpleasantly deranged Royer Collard in his projects of seduction, w&amp;b 
too important to give place to any foreign occupation. But when it was happily teiminated, Royer 
Collard thought anew of putting an end to his adventure. His vanity, moreover, was incessantly 
mortified by the sarcasms of the Infernals. Whilst he calculated his means of attack, he received 
a new letter, dated at Rennes. This letter astonished Royer Collard, who usually was astonished at 
nothing. Royer Collard well knew that when the germ of corruption falls into a young heart, it 
there grows with frightful rapidity, and quickly chokes every good sentiment. But with Mademoi- 
selle de Clebigny the progress had been miraculous. 

" Oh, Molieie !" exclaimed the rake, after reading twenty times the letter of Elise, " one thing in 
the world is more true than thy Tartuffe ! It is thy Agnes ! Hads't thou read this letter, thou 
vvoulds't have added some more verses to the ' School for Husbands.' " 

In fact, since the first letter of Elise, a remarkable reaction had taken place in the bosom of the 
young girl. The day when the God of Evil entered there, in the form of a letter, the ice was bro- 
ken. Like those little flowers which bud beneath the snow, her heart had flowered (if I may so 
speak) and pierced the thick covering with which a monastic education had enveloped it. A single 
ray shone upon it, and the flower began to blow. 

There were many traces in this letter of inexperience, but she already expressed, in a happy style, 
the first anxieties of a youthful heart, its first terrors, its conflicts, and its desires. 

" Sir," said she, to Royer Collard, " I knew that you had come to Rennes ; that every evening 
you went into society, where all the women admired you — that made me uneasy, and yet I felt hap- 
py. Circumstances, independent of my will, as you have doubtless learned, prevented my meeting 
you. Nevertheless, I could not resist my desire of seeing you. I went to Rennes, I know not now 
under what pretext, and remained three days with one of my relations. In these three days I be- 
held you pass every morning before my wmdow. I wished to show myself, but dared not do it. 
What would you have thought of me ? My heart is already too guilty ! I have already too much 
forgotten my duty !" 

Farther down, she added — " I suffer much, and they say that I am much changed. I am sure 
you would find me less handsome. I weep without any cause. Every thing wearies me ; every thing 
disgusts me. I dare no longer look at my mother, for it seems to me that she must read in my coun- 
tenance that which is passing in my mind. I am surely much to blame !" etc., etc. 

Nevertheless, this letter, in which gi'owing passion began to embolden itself, contained nothing so 
interesting as the postscript — " x\ddress yeur letters to Marion, at the Chateau of Villensa." 

« Adorable Marion ! sublime duenna !" exclaimed Royer Collard. " I will raise an altar to thee, 
covered with five franc pieces!" and immediately he took a pen and began to write. 

Those who have read this letter of Royer Collard, assure me that it is a chef-d'ceuvre of its kind. 
It might be avowed by Valmont himself, the hero of " Liaisons dangereuses," the grand master in 
seduction. Yet this letter, every phrase of which burned and threatened to fire the perfumed page, 
was coQiposed with admirable sang-froid. Whilst directing it, the roue hummed an opera air. Yet 
although his heart was not moved, his vanity most assuredly was. Ehse de Clebigny was beautiful, 
noble, and rich. Her min^l, hardly unfolded a few months previous, was developing itself with mar- 
vellous rapidity — and to himself the miracle was owing ! According to his own expression, he had 
been the Pygmalion to this beautiful statue of marble. The rou6 felt himself agreeably tickled in 
his most sensitive point — his vanity. 

" Upon my word," thought he, " an adorable little creature i I shall love her for six months !" 
The reply was not long waited for. Eifteen days from then, Royer Collard i-eceived another let- 
ter. This time the transformation was complete. It was no longer the letter of a child ; but that 
of a passionate, ardent woman, who found expression for all her feelings. Elise depicted the un- 
known emotions through which her ignorant heart had passed for three months, with such power of 
truth, that Royer (bollard, in spite of himself, gave way to sincere admiration. That evening, he 
lead her letter at Mignet's. 

" But that is no ordinary woman," cried Ditmer. " It is an unpublished chapter of Heloise ! I 
compliment you — your labor has not been thrown away !" 



THE INFERNAL BOX. 185 

" Could I meet with such a woman," exclaimed the viscount, " I ehould be foolish enough to fall 
in love !" 

Royer Collaid was radiant with delight. lie swelled himself up, and turned around like a pea- 
cock. Such compliments, in the mouths of such men, accustomed to laugh at every thing, and to 
deny every thing, had, in the eyes of Royer Collard, an inestimable value. They affected his head 
like wine. The rake went out from Mignet's, full of satisfaction and Champagne, drunk with Cham- 
bertin and vanity. 

That evening, he was in the tender vein. In reply to Elise, he indulged in a series of sentimental 
phrases, all besprinkled with points of exclamation, and when he put the direction, his hand tremb- 
led like that of a scholar of rhetoric, or a poet in love. 

If Elise had answered without delay, it is probable that Royer Collard would have resumed his 
accustomed indifference. His vanity would have been sated with triumph ; but Elise answered not. 

Then could you have seen the countenance of the roue gradually darken, and afterwards grow 
pale. Royer Collard suffered in verity — at first through mortified vanity, then from love. From his 
head, his passion descended to his heart. He gave the lie to his past life, and was caught in his 
own snares. He wrote letter after letter, and seduced himself by his own phrases. This was not 
done suddenly, but of course by degrees. 

In proportion as the anxiety of the loue increased, so awaked within him every thing good and 
human in his nature. Royer Collard felt his heart leap as in the first days of his youth; and one 
evening, when alone in his chamber, he reflected sadly on his past life, and demanded of himself the 
meaning of this new illusion, which seemed to flourish on the ruins of all his former ones, he felt 
himself overcome with a mortal discouragement. After a fierce struggle, vanity was conquered by 
nature — Royer Collard wept ! 

Ere long, he forsook all his ancient habits, 

" What ails our friend ]" inquired Romieu, one evening that he beheld him sitting sad and dis- 
consolate in a box in the second tier of the Theatre Francais. " A singular change has been affect- 
ed in him ! I no longer recognize in him the elegant Royer Collard, the idol of tailors, the Jupiter 
Tonans of the fashionable world. His cravat is put on ciooked — the skirt of his coat is antedilu- 
vian — and, God forgive me, but that indefatigable eye-glass, which he formerly aimed incessantly 
from one box to another, now hangs sadly at the end of its chain, like a criminal from the gallows. 
Our friend is unwell. This Elise de Clebigny has cast a spell upon him, most assuredly." 

Three days after this, Royer Collard, on going home, addresses the usual question to his servant — - 
" Any letters from Renncs !" 

" Yes, sir," replies the servant, giving him a letter in the handwriting of Elise, 

Royer Collard trembled with agitation. He raised the letter to his lips, and covered it v/ith kisses ; 
not now, as formeily, with the ironical satisfaction of flattered vanity, but with the ardor of passion. 
A tear — a sincere tear fell upon the paper, and as the valet hardly attempted to conceal a smile. 
Royer Collard kicked him out of the house. 

I regret that want of space compels me to suppress this letter. It was a masterpiece of amorous 
eloquence. Elise explained to Royer Collard the causes of her silence. Never was passion better 
expressed than in this letter. But above all, the conclusion was thrilling. The tremor of love was 
in every line — it w^as delirium ! And Royer Collard could not help crying out — " She has lost her 
senses !" 

He attempted to write — and tore twenty letters, without being able to finish one. At length, he 
determined, in spite of important business, to return to Rennes. 

The evening before the day which he had fixed upon for his departure, he received another letter, 
but the writing was not that of Elise. This writing betrayed a most deplorable ignorance of the 
art. The first lines showed a disposition to crawl down to the signature, whilst the last attempted 
to get up as high as the date. Hence resulted a strange medley, in which none of the words affect- 
ed to retain the straight line recommended in the epistolary code. 

Here follows the letter in its original laconicism, and with all its faults of orthography ; — 

MoN Chaik Mo::?sieur. — Je maits la main a la plume, pour vous apprendre que notre chaire 
demoiselle est bien malade. Cette pauvre petite vous airne tan quele en a perdue la rezon. Ce 
mailheure est haruvee hier aoire. Tout le monde est hici dans la dezolation. Je nai que le tamps 
que de vous ecrir ceci en cachet. Tachez daviser aux moyens qu'il faut prendre et avee lesquel je 
suis votre servante devoue. . Mahion'. 

Pautscriptom — Ne venez pas dici a quelque jour, parcque ga pourrait fere un mailheur, je vous 
ecrirai quand il le fodra. 

As the above letter is incapable of literal translatiorj, we give the substance for the benefit of anti- 
Gallican readers, viz — Marion tells Royer Collard that Elise is very sick, and advises not to come to 
see her until she writes him again. 

On being thus apprised of the folly nf Elise, Royer Collard was on the point of becoming crazy 
himself. He waited for the next letter from Marion witli much anxiety. Three days after, he re- 



186 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

c€fived a letter, but not from Marion. This was from the countess of Clebigny, the mother of Elise. 
Il was a letter worthy (in the beginning at least) of a marchioness of the " ancien regime." 

8be scolded M. Roj'er Collaid sharply, and told him that he had been very daring to aspire to the 
nand of her daughter; he who, after all, was nothing but a "lotuiier," and had no title but talent. 
But the conclusion disagreed materially from the commencement. In writing the last lines the manr- 
chioness gave way to the mother — the style was heart-rending — Madame de Clebigny demanded 
from Eoyer Collard to restore reason t'.) her child — to her little Elise — so young, so fresh, and s&amp; 
besBtiful I 

The letter was not yet finished. One could perceive that the countess had suddenly quitted it to 
run to the bedside of her daughter, but she had again resumed it to add this terrible postscript — 

" My daughter is dead ! Receive a mother's curse !" 

Royer CollaTd, on reading these words, cried out with anguish, and dropped his head between his 
haB^s. For three days he suflcred with a raging fever, and when he was able to raise himself, he 
wrote to Marion as follows : — 

If you can prGcare me a lock of Elise's hair, and I presume the family has preserTcd it, endeavor 
to send it to me, and I will pay you anything you may demand for it. 

H. EOTKK CoU-AHD. 

He soon received an answer, with a lock of hair and a bracelet, Royer Collard swore that he 
would always wear them. Nevertheless, in covering with ardent kisses the hair of Elise, he per- 
ceived that it was black. Now Elise was a blonde. Royer Collard knew very well that mental de- 
rangement can whiten the hair, but he had never heard tell of its making it black. But as a lover 
never looks very closely, and as, moreover, he had only once seen Elise, he concluded that be w^as 
mistaken, and placed the precious curl near his heart. 

The next day, and for some days after, Royer Collard was seen dressed in deep mourning. Cha- 
grin seemed to have made him ten years older. 



SECOND TRIP TO RENNES. 

A month had passed by, and Royer Collard had not yet forgotten Elise, when, one morning, a 
stranger requested permission to speak to him. 

"&amp;ir,°' said the stranger, " I come for a serious motive." 

"'« I am all attention, sir." 

« I will speak to the point. I am the count Montgibert, uncle to Mademoiselle de Clebigny." 

" You V exclaimed Royer Collard, recoiling like Macbtth from the ghost of Banquo. " You have 
ao doubt come to overwhelm me with reproaches. I have deserved all ; and cruel as they may be, 
tbej will never be sufficiently so !" 

Speaking thus, Royer Collard bowed his head to receive the maternal malediction, 

" Moments are precious," replied the count Montgibert, " and no time must be lost in useless re- 
proaches. My sister wrote you that her daughter was dead, after a cruel attack of mental derange- 
iient. She has deceived you !" 

" What say youl" exclaimed Royer Collard, with sparkling e}'es. 

" It is true that Mademoiselle de Clebigny is deranged, but she is not dead. Whatever be the 
iBotive which induced the countess to deceive you, it most be respected. But it is now time to speak 
the truth. That which was false yesterday, may be true to-morrow. The physicians of Rennes are 
ananimously of opinion that he who caused the evil can alone repair it. Your presence" 

" I understand you, and I am ready !" 

" I thank you, sir," continued the count Montgibert, pressing the hand of Royer Collard. " This 
may well blot out many wrongs — the future is a great master. When can you set outl" 

^This very moment, if you will." 

-' Well, this evening. I will meet you at the second relay with my carriage." 

That evening, Royer Collard set out again for Rennes. But in vain he inquired at every relay if 
tiiey had seen the count of Montgibert. They told him each time that they knew not what he 
meant. When the carriage stopped, a man stepped up, and inquired whether his name was Royer 
Collard. 

" I am he," replied the rake. 

" Oh, sir, you are anxiously looked for ! Will you follow me 1" 
"I will follow you — is it to the chateau of Villensa V 

" Wo, sir ; it is here that Mademoiselle de Clebigny has been for several days. ' 
The heart of the roue was agitated with indefinable emotions. " I am about to see her," said he 
K&gt; himself, and he trembled with joy and apprehension. 
" There it is," said the guide, knocking at the door of a house of very good appearance. 



THE INFEltNAL BOX. 



187 



An old woman received Royer Collard. 

" I am Marion," whispered she. " You are going to see our dear little Elise — she is very sick!" 

" And her mother ?" 

" They told Iier not to remain — you will see Mademoiselle alone — there is the chamber." 

Royer Collard's legs trembled under him. Finally, he summoned resolution to enter. It was 
night — the mysterious glimmer of a lamp alone gave light to the chamber. The silence of death, 
reigned around Royer Collard, interrupted only by the steady monotonous tick of a clock. Elise 
de Clebigny, clothed in a white robe, reclined upon a sofa. Her long dishevelled hair concealed her 
features. She was motionless as a statue, and but for sighs that occasionally escaped from her, you 
would have thought tliat she was dead. The roue appioached her trembling, and kneeled — and 
when he took the hand of the poor foolish girl, and carried it to his lips, it seemed to him that this 
hand was cold as marble. 

" Elise !" said he, at length, in a low voice. 

'' Who speaks of Elise ?" replied the young girl. '• Why speak of the dead T Elise is dead ! — 
and it is very fortunate, look ye, for she suffered much! Did you know her"? She was sick there 
and there !" added she, putting her hand to her heart and to her head. " Poor Elise ! why do we 
weep for her? It is so good to die ! Ah !" cried she, suddenly, " what is your name V 

" Royer Collard," replied the roue, trembliiig. 

" 'Tis false — thou art not he !" 

" I am he — I am indeed !" exclaimed Royer Collard, weeping, 

" Thou weepest — men weep, then 1" and saying this, her head sank upon the shoulder of Royer 
Collard, and she also wept. After a few moments she looked up ; but Royer Collard could not dis- 
tinguish her features, for it was dark. 

" Yes, it is true, thou art he ! — art thou not he I" 

" Ah, yes ! I am he that loves thee !" murmured the roue, passing bis arm around the waist of 
Elise, 

The young girl escaped from him, and began to lun about the room. 

" Wilt thou dance]" cried she ; '''tis such a pretty thing, dancing! Elise will not dance any 
more — will she 1" and she began to sing in a voice altered by sickness — 

" Now you are tied, 
Madam the bride ! 
With a golden thread, 
Which unties when you're dead !" 

" Wretch that I am !" exclaimed the rake, and he followed Elise, who still ran on singing. The 
lamp suddenly fell. Royer Collard heard the sound of a door opened quickly and immediately shut 
again, and he found himself alone in the darkness. 

Feeling around, he perceived a ray of light, which came through a keyhole. He approached and 
imagined that he heard a whispering. 

At length he opened the door, and found himself in the midst of all his friends of the Infernal 

Box, who received him with an immense shout of laughter. The viscount had played the part of 
Elise de Clebigny. 

Royer Collard had been the victim of a horrible mystification, the chief magazine of which was 
at Brest, with ramifications at Paris and Rennes, 

Since this occurrence, he has written no more love-letters. Hains B .

SONG OF THE ARAB 



BT H. H. TUCKER. 



Sons of the desert! lise: 

There's a war-cry on the blast ; 
And the flag of the vaunting foeman flies 

Lifee a storm-cloud frowning past. 
Let your wild steeds spurn the plain ; 

Let youi shouts on the night-wind swell : 
With flashing brand and with loosened rein 

On, sons of Ishmael ! 

And, lo ! where the gathering warriors come 
Each from the wilds of his desert home ; 
For each glancing spear and each flying steed, 
Shall an Arab conquer, a Roman bleed : 

Onward in dusky masses wheeling, 
Ev'n as the black-winged tempests wend, 

Dimly the murky night revealing 
Brother to brother, and friend to friend. 

And, hark ! how shrill, 
Through the night- air calm and still. 

The cymbals' clash and the trumpets' peal. 
From the far encampment steal : 

Forward , on the foe ! 
Let the shout of battle swell ; 

Lay the spoiler waste, and the bolster low ! 
On, sons of Ishmael ! 

The watchman watcheth wearily, 

And the sleeper grasps his sword. 
For great is the name, and wide is the fame 

Of the wandering desert-horde ! 
O'er earth hath the conquering eagle flown 

And flapped his wings in pride ; 
But the Arab's lowly tent alone 

Hath his iron grasp defied. 

O'er the arid sands 

A moaning blast is sailing. 
And the war-horse ti-embling stands 

And snuffs the air in fear ; 
There's a rush as of mighty wings, 
And a voice as of spirits wailing, 
And a shadow blacker than midnight flings 
Its shroud o'er the night-watch drear. 

Hail to the dread sirocco. 

The leaguered Arab's friend ! 
He soareth on high in his giant strength, 

And his voice doth the desert rend ; 
There's death in his eye, and its glancing light 

Doth wither where it falls, 



And he shroudeth the sky in his whirling flight, 

And his shadow the earth appals : 
And the shifting sands uprise 

Like demons in his wake. 
And dance as in maniac revelries 

Till the sultry air doth shake ! 
And onward howling fierce they speed 

To the camp of the sleeping foe, 
And the strong-limbed men and the sinewy steed 

Are buried at a blow I 

Joy ! joy ! joy ! 

Raise the shout of triumph high ! 
To the land of the roving Arab race 

Hath the Roman come to die. 
His grave is in the sand. 

And his conqueror is the wind ; 
And the might of that dauntless warrior-band 

Doth the arm of the v/hirlwind bind ; 
And their souls have shrunk from his grasp of 

fire. 
And his hot breath hath lit their funeral pyre ; 
And the hollow blast their requiem moans, 
Sweeping the sand from their whitening bones ; 

And Rome shall bow her head, 
And her widowed daughters mourn. 

For low lie her sons with the silent dead, 
i And their ashes repose not in tomb or urn. 

Hail to the wind, to the mighty wind, 

Whom none can conquer and nought can bind ! 

Wildly he wingeth his viewless way. 

Chasing the clouds in his blithesome play ; 

Proudly he sweepeth the prostrate earth, 

And rouseth the deep in his reckless mirth. 

Tossing the foaming billows high. 

And roaring in wildest revelry ! 

The globe he wandereth round and round, 

And the tempests all to his car are bound ; 

Onward he sweepeth his trackless flight. 

Free — ay ! free as the Ishmaelite: 

Him nor foe nor lord control. 

Wide as his desert wastes his soul; 

And thou, O Wind ! his friend abide, 

Foe and dread of the world beside ; 

Freely both thou and he will fly 

O'er the plains of his own loved Araby, 

And the dark-eyed queen of his home sJiall 

bless 
The guardian Power of the wilderness.

CHAPTER III. 

THE DBPAHTUBE. THE RIDE UP THE GORGE. OXB CRAWFORd's. THE WILLET TRAGEDY. 

It was a lowering, drizzling, uncomfortable morning, that, on which we awoke for our third day's 
enjoyment. The idea of a whole wet day in a country inn, with nothing visible around us but the 
near prospect of a hay-rick, a barn-yard, and a flock of half-drowned sheep — with nothing looking 
comfortable within doors, excepting the contented denizens of the simple homestead — and, out of 
doors, excepting some half dozen ducks revelling in a large, yellow mud-pool, which the rain was 
momentarily swelling to a respectable pond, in the middle of the road before our windows — was in- 
supportable ; and, accordingly, we soon came to the determination to proceed forthwith upon our 
journey, rain or shine. Our coach soon came up to the door, and, as speedily as we eould, we de- 
spatched our breakfasts, bundled in our luggage, bestowed ourselves cosily inside the roomy vehicle, 
drew up the glasses, and proceeded up the gorge. 

The general aspect of the country varied but little from that presented during oar yesterday's ride. 
We neared the mountains, and were conscious of climbing the ascent towards " The Notch," al- 
though we could see nothing but the near fields and forests, which looked sombre enough, in the 
midst of the pelting rain. But we were a merry party within, and cared little for the storm, as we 
were whirled onward by the well-driven team, in which out driver (its proprietor) seemed to take 
especial pride. 

We had proceeded about a dozen ov fifteen miles, as it seemed to us, (we did not travel, as the 
manner of some is, by guide-book,) when we pulled up at the door of a low farm-house, by the road- 
side, which the driver told us was " Old Crawford's. xAs this stop was to water the horses, and not 
ourselves, we preferred remaining in the coach while that opeiation was performed, the very intelli- 
gent driver telling us, meanwhile, all about " Old Crawford," the Patriarch of the Mountain Valley. 
He was yet living, and his two sons, Ethan Allen and Tom, were settled down among these hill 
passes, within short distances of the paternal roof. This was the first family, and for a long time it 
had been the only one, to take up an abode among these mountains ; and the tie which had bound 
the old man for so many years to this rude and desolate spot was growing stronger and stronger, 
as life left him less and less to anticipate, and more and more to remember. The wild denizens of 
the foiest had been his only neighbors, long and long before the foot of the curious and prying tra- 
veller had beaten a broader track than the trail of the red man, or the path of the wild beast, before 
his door. Then came the gainful devotees of trade, the hardy sons of the Green Mountain valleys, 
who had discovered a practical path along these hill sides to the Atlantic towns, for the transfer of 
their produce to market. By and by, a broader road was laid out, something like a township was 
OTganized in the neighborhood, and, of course, theie were soon mails and post offices, and stage 



190 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

coaches, and abundant travel, all along that road. All this the old man had witnessed from out the 
loop-holes of his quiet retreat, and it was not long before he, too, had become possessed of the march- 
of-mind rnania, and must see his sons afloat upon the wide sea of speculation, before he died. So 
he sent them forth from beneath his quiet roof, to make money, as publicans, out of the curiosity of 
others ; and they were now located up the valley, at two different points — themselves, as we were 
told, being curiosities, in their way, sutEcient to attract almost as many visiters to the mountains as 
the other accessories of this wild country. 

By the time the coachman had imparted to us these ficts, (sitting with us in the coach all the 
while, most familiarl}', while a boy was watering the horses,) the time for delaying at this point had 
elapsed ; our Jehu returned to the reins, and we were once more en route. As we approached " The 
Notch," the rain gr ulually abated, and we were enabled to observe more minutely the different fea- 
tures of the glorious scenerj' around us. We ivere winding our way among the bases of high moun- 
tains, springing upwards from the level on which we stood, and burying their lofty peaks in the 
clouds, that still hung in dark and heavy masses above them. The mist, thinner than the dense 
clouds that iiLled the upper air, was curling upwards and downwards, along the lower levels of the 
many hill sides, in wreaths of fantastic shape ; displaying, in succession, a series of the most pictu- 
resque landscapes, like the shiftings of scenery on the stage. In the midst of the general admiration 
which this scene of varied beauty excited, we were conscious of our near approach to a point which 
we had been told at Conway, we should find one of the most interesting in the whole journey. We 
had come to a sudden turn among the hills we had been all the morning traversing, and found our- 
selves entering a broad circular valley, at the base of a wide range of mountains, which rose, am- 
phitheatrically, all around us, as far as the eye, looking on either side, could reach. Green meadows, 
with here and there a few trees, and some attempts at cultivation, were visible in the valley, as the 
eye took in the landscape that lay stretched out before us ; and, in the midst of the whole, there ran 
a shallow and noisy stream, which however struck us as being singularly broad and rapid in its flow. 
We had listened at Conway to the tale of that swift torrent, and we gazed upon it with silent awe. 

The dark hill-sides which bounded our view on either hand were deeply indented with the paths 
that many mighty avalanches had traversed. At the base of one of these mountains, and standing 
close upon the road-side, our guide pointed cut to us the dwelling of the unfortunate Willey family ; 
and the scene of that wonderful and appalling catastrophe, the memory of which throws such a deep 
melancholy over this devoted valley, was full before us. 

An everlasting hill was torn 

From its eternal base ; and borne, 

In gold and crimson vapors dressed. 

To where — a household are at rest ! 
The mountain sepulchre of hearts beloved ! 

The cottage stood ; while the monarch trees 

Leaned back from the encountering breeze, 
As the tremendous pageant moved ! 

The mountain forsook his perpetual throne. 

Came down from his lock, and his path was shown. 

In barrenness and ruin, where 

The secret of his power lies bare ; 

His locks in nakedness arise! 

His desolations mock the skies ! 

" The Willey House" stands at the foot of one of the loftiest of the White Mountains, with a 
small knoll thrown up, naturally, directly in its rear. In the summer of 1826, a young woman 
and her four children were sitting in that cottage, awaiting the return of her husband and their fa- 
ther, from the plain above "The Notch." It was just after night-fall, and the supper table was 
spread in readiness for the arrival of the master of that simple family. It was a chilly evening, and 
a bright fire burned merrily on the hearth, and aided the beams of the candle, that stood on the table, 
in giving the little cabin a cheerful and comfortable look. Suddenly, a loud rumbling noise, like the 
muttering of distant thunder, but shorter and more abrupt, was heard. As the cottage trembled with 
the concussion of air occasioned by the report, the good woman (who was represented to us as hav- 
ing been singularly fair and beautiful) doubtlessly remembered that such noises had not been unu- 
sual that season, and, moreover, that they had always accompanied the numerous slides which were 
constantly occuriing among those mountains. She put her sleeping babe into her bed in the adjoin- 
ing room, and sat down, once more, to await her husband's return. 

It was about an hour nfter this, that a single horseman was taking his solitary way down this 
mountain pass. Feeling somewhat chilled as he came in sight of the ruddy glow that was thrown 
from the windows of the Willey cottage, he abandoned his intention of pushing on to the lower 
Crawford's that night, and dismounted at the door of the house, which he observed wfis standing 
wide open. No one answering his call for attendance, as he held hia bridle in his hand, befote. the 



RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS. 191 

cottage, he determined to put up his Iiorse himself, and for this purpose he crossed the narrow road, 
in the direction, as he well remembered, of the stable belonging to the house. But no such build- 
ing was there! Perplexed with doubts as to the cause of this strange mistake in his recollection, 
the traveller tied his horse to a corner of the fence beside the cottage, and went in. 

There stood the table in the middle of the floor, the candle burning brightly, and the lire blazing 
cheerily upon the hearth, just as has already been described. But nothing living met tJie eye, nm- 
greeted the ear of the stranger, excepting a cat, which was sleeping quietly upon the hearth-stone! 
A feeling of horror, he could not tell wherefore, crept over the wayfarer, as he gazed upon the scene. 
Where were the members of that family for whom all these comforts were prepared — nay, some of 
whom had, as was most plainly perceptible, within a few short moments, been enjoying them 1 — 
There was no human habitation, he well knew, within many miles, and the nearest of these by 
more than one half was that he had left more than an hour before, in " The Notch." He had come 
the only road between the two points, and had met no one. He went into the sleeping room, ad- 
joining tlie apartment he had first entered. There was u bed, the coverings of which were thrown 
down to the foot, and he observed that the bedding had been pressed but slightly, and, as he thought 
he could surely peiceive, by no other foira than that of an infant. There were two other rooms in 
the cottage, inio both of which he went, but no sign of human inhabitant was visible ! 

He returned to the open air. The night was clear and star-lit. The air was cold and biacing, 
though it was midsummer. The stranger walked forth into the road a few paces. He had been in 
the habit, i-egularly, once a year, of travelling this road, but remembered only its more prominent 
features ; yet he thought that the little river which ran through the valley was noisier then than he 
had ever known it before, and as he had met with some more obstruction in the road, when on foot, 
than he had seemed to do before he dismounted from his horse, he thought that there was some 
change in the level of the highway since he was there last. But these changes, if, indeed, they were 
not imaginary, he found quite insufKcient to afford him the least clue to the solution of the mystery 
that was every moment becoming more and more intolerable to him. He threw himself once more 
upon his saddle, and rode rapidly back to the younger Crawford's, in " The Notch ;" to whom he 
told the story of his inexplicable adventure. The son of the forest instantly called up his men, and 
with them and the stranger, took horse, and went down to the valley with ail speed. 

" Had you heard any noises, like the fall of a slide from the hills, as you rode along 1" asked Craw- 
ford, of the stranger. 

" Only one since that which I heard when with you, at your house," replied the other. 

" When did you hear the second repoit?" said Tom Crawford. 

'• About twenty minutes before I came to Willey's," said the traveller. " It was far louder than 
the other, and continued longer — like thunder echoing among the mountains." 

The haidy denizen of the mountain passes was puzzled. Suppose it were a slide — the people 
gonCj and nothing destroyed ! It was all inexplicable. 

Reaching the entrance to the valley, it became evident to ihf! practised eye of the mountaineer 
that an avalanche of unusual extent had fallen from the hill-siJe uirectlj' in the rear of the Wille}' 
cottage. It was dark, and he could not see minute objects, but a huge heap of gravel lay directly 
in the road, as the travellej-s neared the house, and it became obvious that the barn had been carried 
away by the slide. Going a few steps below the house, it was perceptible to Crawford that a por- 
tion of the mass of earth had fallen on the lower, as well as on the upper side of the cottage, and 
that both tiie masses had united their tremendous forces nearly in front of the unharmed habitation ! 
The party entered the house. Every thing, even to the quiet slumbering of the unconscious animal 
that lay upon tlie hearth, wap just as it was left by the stranger, and still no hitman life was there/ 

" They have fled from the avalanche, to seek shelter in the valley," suggested the traveller. 

" They have gone down to the tent," oaid his companion ; " I know where it is — let us on, and 
find them ! They set up the tent on purpose ; for these slides are happening, at this time of year, 
every day ; and this summer they have been more common than ever. So Willey had a tent put 
up, down by the brook." 

But no tent could be found ! The brook was now a swift and turbulent flood, and was flowing, 
in a broad and resistless stream, over the site of the camp of refuge ; while the cottage, whence the 
lost ones had fled, was standing in the still clear night, safe and unharmed! How " past finding 
out" are all the ways of over-ruling Providence ! 

It were profanity to dwell upon the scene which was presented in that wild and quiet valley when 
the tidings of this disaster had reached the home of the lost wife's early childhood. The husband's, 
father's, mother's, brother's griefs are sacred. I forbear the attempt to paint them. Yet, as I gazed 
upon the scene, I have fancied the lament which, on that morning, must have burst from the heart 
of each, as each looked, through gushing tears, upon that fearfully quiet scene 

" Oh, I have lost ye all ! 

Children, and wife, and friends ! 
Ye sleep beneath a mountain-pall ! 
A mountain-plumage o'er ye bends !

WITHERED FLOWERS. 



VY CATHARINE H. WATERMAN, 



Ye're fading from me now. 
Ye fair, sweet relics, treasured here so long, 

Like gladness from my heart, 
Or the last echo of some cherish'd song. 

Why have I ever loved 
What fate seems earliest with decay to touch ] 

Why lived, but to have proved 
That I alone have loved in vain too much ? 

How like to yours, sweet flowers. 
Was the glad promise of my youthful morn ! 

Hope pictur'd rose-wrcath'd hours. 
But the fair blossom ever brought its thorn. 

Where is that rainbow wing 
Resting beside my pathway — lending there 

A light to every thing, 
A smile to sunny earth like angels wear 1 

Faded as ye, and gone ; 
For oh ! I cherish'd what was made to die. 

And weary and alone, 
Mourn that I built not hopes above the sky. 

In your pale, fragile forms. 
Dear wither'd flowers, my heart may truly trace 

The conflicts and the storms 
That shroud and compass all the human race. 



I I've clung to friendship's chain 

, Till, Unk by link, it parted in my grasp ; 
i All, all have been in vain. 

And the cold fetters round my heart-strings clasp. 

The first free gush is o'er ; 
The fountain that was wont, with silvery sound, 
1^ Soft melody to pour, 
Is frozen at the source — by ice-chains bound. 

I And ye, mementoes pale, 

1 Were smiling gladly when I took ye first ; 

But ah ! the unseen gale 
On your devoted heads in anger burst. 

Ye might have lived to feel 
Longer the gentle hand — the soft caress 

Round your young blossoms steal — 
Had not my fingers leani'd their buds to press. 

Ye loved me not in life, 
Else, gentle flowers, your pure and fragrant breath 

Would still with sweets be rife. 
Not slumbering coldly 'neath the touch of death. 

But I will cherish ye. 
Companions — confidants — of lonely hours ; 

My heart your tomb shall be, 
Where ye with memory lie, wild wither'd 
flowers. 



THE PRIVATEER. 



A TALE OF THE LATE AMERICAN WAR. 



(Comimied from page 128.) 



Sweet to the youth the stolen kiss, 

From chilling lips, thatthide for bliss ; 

To husband deal' tixe half caress 

Of bride scarce taught her right to bless ; 

To her, oh, sweet the chtrab lip 

Of babe that laughs her breast to sip — 

But dearer far, when chains are riven, 

Is Freedom's gift, by Freemen given. 



CHArXEIl VI. 

THE RELEASE. 



A STILL and beautiful morning dawned on the Sea-GuU and the Tiger, grappled fast together, 
and bending buoyantly over the broad irregular footsteps of the hurricane. American colors drooped 
in silent brotherhood from each, as if rebuked at the awful sight beneath. Not in the sweeping 
rush and stunning THe/e'e ars the horrors of battle ; but its scourging reality comes sickening over us at 
the after -scene. Scarcely a spot on the deck of the prize was unstained with blood ; and many young 
hearts, fresh perhaps from their mother's knee, withered at their own work. The slain lay stiff in 
oozing puddles of gore, which dripped in sluggish clots through the scuppers, reddening the sea 
around, and creeping up through the caps of floating foam, which grinned like death-heads on the 
waves. Sometimes a groan and struggle from a pile of bodies would tell of some one alive or dying, 
for the fight was hardly ended at dawn. It was a study of strange and fearful interest to view the 
faces of the dead, and gather from their grim expression what last thought flashed then, whether of 
eternity, home, or mortal hate. There was the reeking weapon clutched, the sabre half-sheathed in 
the ample chest, and enemies locked in hideous embrace, looking wrath even in death. The wild dis- 
array of the rigging, especially of the Tiger, told a horrible tale. The unbalanced yards and dangling 
ropes were glistening in the sunshine with human blood. Tufts of scalp, and shreds of clothing 
■were glued to the yards and shrouds ; more than one dead man was lodged in the top or swung 
stark elsewhere ; and when the stiffened topsails vv^ere spread to the air, irregular blood spots stained 
the snow-white canvas. The living were mustered, and many names were unanswered ; the dead 
were gathered together on the main deck of the Tiger; a short ceremonial of a burial service answer- 
ed for all ; their requiem was the cannon's roar, and the ocean's wail ; and the same wave swept 
over friend and enemy. Trembling and pale with emotion, which no one could divine, Walter De 
Berrian was wandering over the deck. An order to release the prisoners in the hold of the Tiger, 
hurried him to the hatchway ; when, listening breathlessly, he heard the cHnk of hammers, and many 
glad voices in French. Walter sickened and arose — there was no English voice. Several wasted 
Frenchmen, in tattered naval uniform, were supported to the deck. As the free air of the sea braced 
their languid frames, they wildly thanked their deliverers, and that mightier power of the skies. A 
tall and noble one among them gazed fondly for a moment at the flaunting colors, and exclaimed in 
English, " Hail America ! hail liberty, first born darling of my country !" The home word?, the im- 
passioned tone and look called forth a loud huiTah, and Walter slowly read in the flashing face of 
the noble released, the features of Charles Hairaan. The recognition was not mutual. 

Long after the imperial sun had retired in the blaze of the world's applause, De Berrian was hur- 
riedly pacing the Sea-Gull's deck. It was one of those hazy delicious nights at sea, when invisible 
spirits entrance the wanderer with the minstrelsy of home, of love, and woman. The ocean wore 
his gossamer of web-spun glass, the sky was soft, the stars voluptuous in their gaze, and the moon 
wept tears so sad and sweet, that the poet saw in her a lovely mourner's face, pensive through the 
veil her sighs have dampened. All felt the rapture of that hour. The gruff " port helm," " and 
steady so," were gentler than their wont ; the rude jest and ribald song were hushed. 



194 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

Presently a note, low and floating, stole upon ear as mystic as the serenade of air ; it was the me- 
lody of" Home, sweet home," that song exquisite even in home's green bowers, and oh, how thrill- 
ing away ! The wooing breeze lingered on the topsail's bosom, and the silver billows hushed their 
tinkling fall to listen to the lay. Wild and deep it swelled to the fervid rapture of passion — but at 
the last fond line, " theie is no place like home," the minstrel's tongue forgot its duty, and the song 
was ended in a sigh. That sigh was borne to Walter's ear, whispering the gentle name of Catharine 
coupled with his own. He started, looked to the singer, and Charles Harman was sitting in the 
shadow of the mainsail, gazing tearfully on the sea. Walter trembled as he approached. 
i^ " In tears, my friend, and the night so lovely 1" 

" It is at such a time," answered Charles, " that the nothingness of life is seen apart from hope. 
But a day ago, I was a prisoner, yet wept not; for hope pictured a future of joy. Now that I am 
free, and among my countrymen, I sorrow at the eternity between happiness and me." 

"You are an American^" 

" I am. I left America several years before the war. Landing a stranger in the West Indies, I 
had the good fortune to render an important service to the French Admiral of the station, and at his 
hands I was honored with a commission in the Navy of the republic." 

" But — Charles — the duell" — unguardedly asked the other. 

" Heavens ! who are you ?" 

" Walter De Berrian." 

The cousins were clinging in each others arms, and how wildly affecting was that meeting. The 
time, the place, the strange improbability and stranger reality I Is there not a destiny whose 
mightiest agent is a word, a trifle 1 How often is the eternal flat of weal or wo, to a world, or its 
obscurest tenant, dated from a nod or born in a syllabic ! For many moments of intensest feeling, 
neither of the young men spoke, Harman first- broke silence. His inquiries were rapid, and his 
emotion overwhelming. " How, O Weaker, my cousin, and fiiend, how, and why, do I find you here ?" 

" How, and why, are you here ]" eagerly inquired De Berrian, " or, rather, are you here ] years 
ago you were numbered vi^ith the dead, and at this liour your father and Catharine are mourning." 

" Good God ! how is this? they are alive and well !" passionately demanded Charles, 

" They were, when I saw them last — but tell me your strange disappearance." 

By broken inquhies the agitated young Harman gleaned from Walter the time and manner of his 
departure from their mutual home. It was long ere he was suflSciently composed to narrate the 
mystery of his being. The story was one of vivid interest, a key to tlie wayward impulses of ad- 
venture ; a leaf from the visions of youth, dreaming, restless, and insatiate. 

" And that duel," said Charles Harman, " an obscure brawl, with a nameness villain, is the pivot 
of my destiny and yours, the poisoning spring to my father's age and my sister's youth ! On the 
night of ni}' arrival at New Orleans, I was in a crifc, in company with several travelling acquaintances, 
with whom I had contracted a sort of off-hand companionship, v/ith little thought or inquiry as to 
character. One of the fellows took offence at a heedless word from me, and demanded immediate 
satisfaction. The others seemed to legard it as a matter of course, and one of them oliered to act as 
my friend. I confess, stranger and friendless as I was, far from a delightful home, I might never see 
again, the idea of standing up to stop bullets, was not captivating. We fought immediately, on a 
deserted levee, by starhght. My honorable opponent fired before his time, and his ball whistled by 
my ear. The truth flashed on me ; I was entiapped by a gang of those murderous villains that in- 
fest the city — I fired instantly — the scoundrel fell with a howl — and I was knocked down from be- 
hind, stabbed, robbed, and left for dead. 

Two days after, in the retired house of a true-hearted Virginian, the fi-st flash of returning sense 
gleamed across my brain ; and, steaUng over my heated face, I felt the silken touch of ostrich feathers 
as if waved by a child of air. I heard a nursery glee of spring and infancy, and the tones were soft, 
clear, and warbling, as echo's lay in the stilly night. Entranced, my eyes opened on a rosy girl of 
eleven, standing between the folds of the damask curtain, and waving, as she sung, a bunch of 
feathers over my face. She was beautiful, oh, as purely beautiful as the youngest star of evening. 
Her laughing lips just swelling with the ruby streaks of the ripening cherry — her cheeks of pulpy 
oval and blossom tints — her floating eyes, of that delicious ocean blue, when Autumn and eve are 
slumbering on its distant waves — and, above all, her wild ringlets, soft and auburn, as if spun by 
genii from the dovi^n of gold, burst upon me, the vivid personation of all that is pure and exquisite in 
Heaven. Trembling, blushing, frightened at my devouring gaze, she glided away with the noiseless 
mystery of a sylph — yet one glance — one instant glance I caught of her figure ! Fairies would have 
worshipped it; angels would have stolen it away to heaven, as a model to correct their own defor- 
mity ! She was gone — and I wondered at life, truth, and creation. 

I was subdued ; the restless, gnawing, spirit of travel was gone, it seemed for ever. Distinction 
was a phantom — Romance a mockery of reality, and storied History but an urn of ashes that winds 
would idly scatter. Home rose up before me, and something whispered the sin of my aimless de- 
seition. What cause — what light had I to hurl from my lips the chalice of joy, when the happiness 
of others was mingled in its draught 1 Long and accusing was that reverie — maiay and repentant 
were the resolves I vowed ! 



THE PIIIVATEER. 195 

My benefactor was a gentleman by the name of WooJvillc. He h--i(l discovered me on the scene 
of my encounter, as he was returning from the city, at a later hour thafi usual. His wife was a lady 
of accomplished manners, and true southern urbanity. They had but one child — the lovely Agnes — 
the spirit of my every thought. 

Heavens, how my heart leaped with frantic delight, when, as I awoke next morning, she skipped 
into the room, and mischcviously threw a dew-dipped bunch of flowers on my cheek. Hours, days, 
swept uncounted on. I was eighteen, ardent, ;ui(l grateful. I loved, adored, my fairy queen, and 
slowly, surely, deliciously, read her untutored heart. She breathed its infant purity at one only 
shrine — that shiine was myself. There, on a bed of heavenly pain, playing with flowers and curls, 
songs, and kisses, I won from the artless Agnes a half-sworn promise to be my little wife. Years 
have tlown since then, yet still it is a joy past words, to think here, on this wide sea, in the storm suid 
hurry of a perilous life, that there is a tear and prayer for me on that cherub's pillow." 

A tear that stole into De Berrian's eye betrayed the sympathy of that priceless thought. Harman 
continued — 

" What a record of human weakness may be writteii from the dreams, the changes of an hour ! 
I had recovered, and strolled out on a fresh bright morning. It was on the 4th of Jul}^ I had stepped 
upon the tide of the world's existence, and it swept me on. Clouds were striding in splendid ma- 
jesty across the sky ; the flaunting breezes came loaded with the perfume of prairies, and ringing 
with the din of life. Nature and man were shaming my listless content. That great city rejoiced — 
I watched the proud tread of the gleaming ranks, and snuflTed the wind that wafted the roar of drum 
and cannon. Standing in the shadow of the star-spangled flags, I heard the orator's deep appeal, 
and joined iir the people's answering shout. In that wild hour, I felt that the world could not hold 
m}^ soul ; the powerful spirit of travel was on me. 

" I held I he child Agnes to my bosom, and kissed away the tears that bedewed her face. That 
parting was fond and agonizing. The next day I was bounding across the turbid waters of the 
Mexican Gulf in a swift West Indian trader. It was onboard that I first sav? a casual notice of that 
fatal duel. The paper spoke of ' An affair of honor between a blackleg and a young man, a stranger, 
whose name was ascertained to be Charles Harman. Both were killed at the first fire.' Fearful 
of a distressing mistake, I wrote home at the first opportunity." 
"No letter was ever received," answered Walter. 
" Dreadful," said Charles ; " my poor father ! my dearest sister !" 

" Sail, ho !" from the look-out, startled the communing cousins. Far away to windward there 
shone a scarcely distinguishable cloud-like spot. Captain Parole called for his night glass, and the 
Sea-Gull shortened sail. In a little time the distant spot swelled into the dim outline of a square- 
rigged vessel. The captain looked for a moment, and handed the glass to De Berrian. At the first 
sui vey he dropped it from his eye, and exclaimed — " The Atalanta !" 

The ship came majestically along lilie a queen of the sea, till suddenly she hauled as close to the 
wind as she could stagger. A gun across her bows from both the Tiger and Sea-Gull, was regarded 
with easy contempt. 

" She can't escape," remarked captain Parole, " and it is a pity to cut up that holyday suit of hers." 
The brig and schooner ran as close as possible to the wind, and in about two hours the Sea-Gull 
hove a broadside into the ship. The colois came sudden'y to the deck, and the tall Atalanta fell 
under the lee of her puny conqueror. Great was the astonishment of the prize-guard when they 
saw the Tiger wearing American colors — greater still, when almost the first that sprung upon deck 
were their quondam messmate Peter, and the prisoners De Berrian and Harman. But what was the 
amazement of the American skipper and crew, when De Berrian and their old cook Peter, were 
knocking off their irons'! On the fifth day after, the Sea-Gull and her prizes came to an anchor in 
the harbor of St. Labrador. 

In three days the gallant Sea-Gull was ready for saa. Her restless captain yearned for the broad 
fierce ocean. The signal was already flying at the fore, when a gig manned by U. S. seaman, came 
alongside, and Charles Harman stepped on board. Walter was silently sitting on a gun. 

" I have come again," said Charles, anxiously taking his hand, " I will throw up my commission 
for your consent. Walter — you will — you must go home with rae." 
" The Sea-Gull is my home !" 

" Walter !" implored his cousin, stooping till their cheeks touched, " can you bear unkindness to 
my sister 1 'Tis you that are scornful. Come, and by my own love, she shall forgive !" 
" Forgive ! she has nothing to forgive, that I acknowledge." 
" She shall be yours, or I leave that home again forever." 

" Never !" firmly answered De Berrian, " she said it — no blood-stained hand should twine bridal 
flowers around her haughty brow. Her proud father would give her not to a penny less dog ! 'Tis 
I that forgive, but can I forget 1 " 

At this moment Peter came aft, and handed a bundle to Walter. He silently unwrapped it, and 
displayed the uniform of a lieutenant. 

" Our brave second- lieutenant," said Walter, " was killed in the action. I am in his stead, Charlee, 
the Sea-Gull is my home." 



196

" Then there is no hope," sighed young Harman, " and I must seek my home alone. What a tale 
for ray accusing sister ! Have you nothing — no word — or letter to send 1" 

" Tell Catharine," said Walter with an effort, " that her long-mourned brother was a captive on 
the sea, and that cousin she cursed bled to win his freedom. Tell her we have talked of happier 
days, in the silence of the midnight watch, and her name was ever spoken with a blessing. Say, if 
my last prayer be said on sea or shore, her name shall close my lips. Give her this braid — you 
know when she gave it" — and a tear stood in his eye — " it may recall the time when she thought 
more kindly of its wearer. It is the last memento of Walter De Berrian." 

Charles hid the braid in his bosom, for he could not speak. 

" Peter," asked Walter, for the negro had been listening with intense interest, " would you not go 
home to your friends'?" 

" No, massa," returned the faithful black, with a reproachful look, " you all my friends — neber 
leave you, you gwine — I'm gwine too." 

But a vivid change had brightened the noble features of the handsome Harman; he stood pioud 
and tall with curling lip, and dilated nostril ; his eye was rivetted on a small squadron that was 
bounding into port under the glorious tri-colored flag. 

" Walter, I am not the culprit bearer of your message. See there," and he proudly pointed to a 
beautiful witch-like schooner, amid the squadron, " there is La belle lanthe — she has been re-taken — 
I go to report myself to the commandant. I serve under a foreign flag, but against the enemies of 
my country." 

De Beirian's eye rested with a sailor's delight on the elegant fabric that slid over the water with 
the easy hauteur of a coquette — he turned to his cousin — 

" Think of your father and sister." 

" Think of my honor," was the proud answer. 

De Berrian gladly grasped his hand, and exclaimed, " honor first — may God bless you !" 

The drum sent forth its rolling prelude, and Peter sprang away. Charles Harman went over the 
side, and Walter felt that the last link was broken. The Sea-Gull was sailing to her glory and her 
grave. 



THE EXILE'S RETURN 



IZABETH B. BARRETT. 



When from thee I did part away, 

And from my land for years, 
I did not think to come again 

With those same parting tears. 
I come again to hill and lea —

When I was standing last 
Upon the shore of cheeiful green. 

Our vessel neareth fast.

No more with iliec ! 

Had I beheld thee still and dead, 

I might more cleaily know. 
How heart of thine could turn as cold 

As hearts by nature so — 
How change could touch the falsehood-free 

And changeless thee ! 

But now thy last-seen tender looks 

Within my soul remain ; 
And it is hard to think that they 

Will shine no more again — 



That I shall vainly wait — ah me ! 
No word from thee ! 

I could not bear to look upon 
That mound of funeral clay. 

Where one sweet voice is silentness 
And one fair brow decay — 

Wheie all thy mortal I niight sec — 
But never thee ! 

For thou art where the loving are, 

Whose parting pain is o'er ! 

And I who love and weep alone, 

Where thou wilt weep no more, 

Weep bitterly, not selfishly, 

For me, not thee ! 

I know that thou can'st never know 

The anguish which I feel ; 
Because upon no brows in Heaven, 

An earthly grief may steal — 
And grief thou knewest mine, would be 

Still shared by thee ! 



FRENCHMAN'S REFLECTION 



IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY. 



rHANSLAEr.D FHOM THi; "MELANGES OF M, NISARD. 



London should be visited for the sake of Westminster Abbey. On one side you have the Parha- 
ment, another antiquity full of grandeur, and connected witli interesting reminiscences, Tw^o new 
societies inhabit these walls, which were built by two societies now no more, for creeds which time 
has abolished. The work of thought has perished, the work of the hand has survived. Liberty has 
given a new youth to the old halls of Parliament. Protestantism has exiled from Westminster Ab- 
bey the Catholic descendants of those who built it. 

On entering Westminster Abbey you are met by a kind of usher. " Do you wish to see the whole 
edifice, or only a part?" and he names you the two prices. The bargain struck, he goes to wake 
another usher, who is asleep on a chair at the foot of a pillar a few paces distant. This man rises, 
and rubs his eyes, and then conducts you to all the tombs of importance, naming, as he goes on, the 
persons who are buried. If you remain too long in one chapel, he politely requests you to finish 
your tour, telling you that when he has shown all you will be at liberty to retrace your steps. This 
I never failed to do. 

The first time that I visited this beautiful Abbey was on the occasion of a great wind. One might 
say that the clouds were tearing themselves to pieces against the roofing {ioiture,) This mysterious 
noise above my head, and the silence at my feet and around me, confounded me. I have felt some- 
thing like it in the woods, at the foot of great trees, when the rising wind begins to shake their tops, 
and the grass is not even bent. But in the middle of a great nave, surrounded by the tombs of eight 
centuries, standing as a minute and weak man before an immense work made by the hand of man, 
with a mind lost in doubt and uncertainty in the presence of two religions which have deeply moved 
the human mind — in this situation I have experienced, in a degree still more lively, the singular 
state when thought seems to cease, and the pulse to beat no more. Strange that such mighty spec- 
tacles are requisite to overcome the mind of a man and to suspend for a moment thought, which is 
so indocile ! Strange, that the voice of great forests, the murmuring of the sea, the silence of old 
mountains, is not more than sufficient to silence for an instant the little sound which we call thought ! 

Catholicism built this great church for a great leligion, that a whole people might go there to hear 
the woid of God chanted viiih all the force of the human voice ; that man might feel his own little- 
ness in the temple of God, finding that the mighty song of assembled multitudes beneath its vaulted 
roof did not crack the edifice. Protestantism, by taking possession of Westminster Abbey, has 
straitened it for its own religion de salons, for its chants by women and children of the choir, for its 
sermons before a small auditor}-, for a handful of the faithful to which the minister reads prayers in 
a grave and sober voice, without accent, and without vibration. The nave of the old temple has 
been cut in half, and a boarded enclosure has been made with seats and benches for about a hun- 
dred of the faithful. The other half is empty ; the consecrated soil begins at this wretched bit of 
carpenter's work, which has been built but to rot, while the walls, which generations raised for 
eternity, are neither revered nor profaned, unless by the rows of tombs which stand as an object of 
veneration for the traveller. Protestantism had not voice enough to fill these vast aisles, nor to ascend 
to these vaulted roofs ; a mutilated edifice was necessarj^ for a mutilated religion ; less space was re- 
quired for reason than for faith. 

The struggle between two religions in the same church is not less plainly shown by the tombs of 
Westminster Abbey. Catholicism reared it, Catholicism stamps the greatest character on the tombs. 
I am not here speaking of art; there are more skilful strokes of the chisel in the monuments of Pro- 
testantism ; in those of Ca'holicism there is little more than faith, often without art, but we feel a 
force in their workmanship, and a sort of certainty of another life, which touches us profoundly. 
Those effigies of the Kings of the Norman race, all lying armed on the tombstones, all with joined 
hands, in the same attitude, all conceived according to one idea, though successive ages may have 
improved their execution ; those women, those children, those faithful servants.who are ranged about 



198 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

the tomb, kneeling, their hands joined as those of the deceased, who mourn not, but pray, because 
tears pass away, not faith, and man can pray always rathei than mourn ; all these figures, who re- 
present the drama of death, but do not play it, as in certain Protestant monuments — all this ndivdi 
of an art, I say, the masters of which were but simple workmen, exercises a singular sway over the 
imagination and the heart. The design has been to make really dead persons ; there is the vei-y stiff- 
ness of a corpse in these limbs ; nought is beating under this armor, these eyes are closed to open no 
more ; the tomb is sealed, all is finished, but the artist has conveyed by these joined and heaven-lifted 
hands a thought — yes, the thought that possessed the deceased before he resigned his soul to God — 
the thought which inspired the artist himself, and often repaid him for his toils — the thought which 
filled the servants and the children of the deceased, the people who followed his obsequies, and the 
priest who sprinkled holy water on his rehcs — in a word, the thought that God may be disarmed by 
prayer. 

In the tombs of Protestantism unity is gone. We find the diversity of a museum — ^busts, emblems, 
and statues. It is no more religious thought, but caprice and vanity, which gives the idea of a mo- 
nument ; it is art without faith which executes it. Praj'er is no more considered ; dramatic attitudes 
are given to the dead ; some threaten, others smile upon you ; one plays a part, and another expires 
with a grace. I have seen some mounting to heaven surrounded by clouds, and others haranguing 
Parliament. There is a noble lady who died, doubtless, much regretted b3',hcr husband ; she is in 
her bed, expiring, while Death — that is to say, the great black skeleton with the scythe in its hand, 
which serves to frighten ciiildren — darts from a secret cavern under the bed of this poor lady. The 
husband perceives him ; places himself between his wife and death, holds his suppUant hands to the 
latter, and entreats it with tears in his eyes. Now, translate all this : — hard Nightingale was a good 
husband, or, at any rate, wished to pass as such. But who was Lmd Nightingale 1 Why, a person 
who was rich enough to bury his wife at Westminster. This abbey is not confined to Kings and 
great men ; it is a Pantheon, where every one pays for his place, and that dearer than at a cemetery. 
Shakspeare occupies less space there than Tuady Nightingale. George Canning and Pitt lie each 
under a slab with their name inscribed. Those whose mere name does not say enough are not in a 
position to be better known, or do not deserve it. Leave all this train of epithets and show of titles 
to those who have only made their life known by their death. A stone and a name is enough for 
celebrated men, since there is no longer a faith to lay them on their tombs, and to join their hands, 
and thus to show that their strength was only in prayer. The epitaph and monument should be left 
to history, and the deep impression whicli a grand biography concealed under a slab of six feet makes 
on the mind should not be stilled under works of masonry. 

This profusion of tombs does not convey the idea of death. A grave newly dug, a coffin from 
which the pall has been removed, the shovel-full of earth thrown upon it — these touch much more 
forcibly. Death, as a collective idea, only inspires declamations, and awakens no real sorrow. On 
the contrary, the nearer we are to the corpse, the more sad and impressive is this idea. 

I am ashamed to confess that I went through " Poet's-corner" with indifference ; yet Shakspeare 
is there, or rather his statue and cenotaph, paid for by two performances at Drury-lane, for his actual 
remains lie beneath the stones of the church at Stratford, where his age sufiered him to die, caring 
no more for his death than his birth. Singular enough ! he lived in the time of Elizabeth, in one of 
those epochs of public prosperity wlsen the slightest superiority stand? in its full light, and j^et there 
is less information respecting his life than that of the most insignificant courUer, Some have written 
that he was bailifl' of a county, others that he poached on the estates of great lords ; that ho held the 
horses of the audience at the gates of the theatre, and played the ghosts in his own pieces. You 
will not find his history in his dramas — you will not perceive the author under his characters. He 
creates men, gives them passions, and when this is done, leaves them to be carried on by those 
passions, and troubles himself no more aliout them. If they commit faults, they pay the penalty — 
if they are stronger than events, they overcome them — if weaker, they yield. Shakspeare has not, 
like our tragedians, a favorite character by which he communicates himself to the pit; the one who 
happens to be on the stiige is the one he loves the best. You would bo his dupe if you strove to seek 
him in the parts he has created, and under the masks which he has given to the great passions which 
excite tears or laughter. You believe him oppressed by a sombre melancholy, v/hen perhaps he was 
a heaity laugher, who loved to give free play to his imagination, and to prate like Cassio with the 
passing shade ; or perhaps he was some cateloss pliLlasopher, appearing at the fall of the curtain, at 
the moral of his terrible drama, with a calm fine countenance, and with the air of a man who is un- 
moved amid so many calamities, and says to the pit, " None of this was my fault." His statue says 
nothing to you, and this empty tomb, in which there is not even a particle of his ashes, is but a 
figure in a museum — a museum of tombs, if you will have it so. Besides, placed as he is, in a little 
nook ui the wall, he is crowded by poets, who beyond the learned circles of London have scarcely 
more celebrity than our album and almanack writers, with even some prosaists among them. Such 
an arrangement is erroneous ; there is no interest in this amalgamation of glories of all degrees ; emotion 
is destroyed by cuiiosity. It is only in the presence of the old tombs of Catholicism that the imagi- 
nation is awakened, and that we feel all that is great and touching in the past.

That which chiefly aflfects us in ages gone by is the moral character which distinguishes them from 
our own. If we love the majestic aspect of the old churches, those works of faith and religion, it is 
because on every subject our convictions are but weak and wavering ; because we feel the necessity 
of betaking ourselves to something strong, to something which comes home to us, and which allows 
us to rest awhile from our wearisome contradictions. If we arc forcibly struck by all that bears the 
mark of enthusiasm, it is because in us enthusiasm has been withered by experience, and because, 
dreading, above all, to be dupes, or even to appear such, weenvy the peace of those simple men who 
did not laugh aloud at those grave matters on which depend happiness and misery, and who did not 
hide themselves to perform their duties. 

If we love the ligures that pray on the old monuments, it is because on modem tombs religious 
thought has been stifled by wordly thought, doubtless that the deceased themselves might not be the 
laughing-stocks of the curious. If the majestic uniformity of Catholicism inspires us with sincere 
respect, it is because we are now accustomed to diversity and isolation, willingly contesting all human 
authority less by the arriere-pensees of disorganization than on account of the incapacity we feel of con- 
vincing ourselves of the rights of any one whatever — a strange situation for people who are thus in 
a state of dull and perpetual insurrection ! There is no regret in the comparison we make between 
the past and the present; our mind is distracted for a moment — that is all ! This temporary distrac- 
tion does not afterwards make us bear more clumsily the load of uncertainties, of contradictions, and 
of scruples, which render us cold scoffers from the fear of being enthusiastic ; lastly, of our caprices 
and our isolations, all of which illude us by their appearing to proceed from liberty. Liberty makes 
us love our own age with a real and positive love, and ages past with a love puiely poetical. The 
aspect of an old cathedral does not cure a heart sick with excess of liberty ; and I verily believe that. 
Westminster Abbey would not remove one doiibt of a person of this century. 



TO A PORTRAIT OF A LADY 

PAINTED BY SULLY . 



T PAEK BENJAMIN, 



Lady, some missioned angel smiled 
Upon thee when thou wast a child ; 
For in that pensive eye of thine 
Celestial colors softly shine ; 
And on that sweet, expressive face, 

The lustre of a quiet mind 
Softly reposes — like the trace 

Of starlight trembling, when the wind 
Breaks the smooth mirror of the sea — 

Or like that strange, delusive light, 
When sleep has set the fancy fiee 

To soar beyond the dome of Night. 

Can'st thou be real 1 art thou not 
Too beauteous for this earthly spot ? 
Upon that brow, so clear and high, 
Has sorrow rested 1 has a sigh 
Or tear been thine, or any shade 
Of grief upon thy spirit laid 1 
Ah, yes ! if, in this dreary world, 

One, so devinely fiir — around 
Whose form bright pinions should be furled 

To keep it holy — can be found ; 
In hours gone by, some change to pale 

Thy morning splendor must have passed, 
Though all life's woes, like shadows, fail 

Before thy happy smile to last. 

VOL. V. — 50. IV. 1 



Joy, tranquil joy and mild content 
In those angelic features blent, 
Tell like a fountain's sparkling flow 
That all is pure and bright below. 

And thou hast crossed youth's flowery -^erge : 

And well I deem, relentless Time 
Doth towaids that path thy footsteps urge 

When, just beyond their sunniest prime, 
The ripe fruits of the season fall. 

And puiple clusters on the vine 
Droop from the greenly- mantled wall. 

In rich maturity, like thine ! 
A perfect woman — fairest, best, 

Of all this world holds fair and good — 
If man without thee were unblest. 

How dark would be his solitude ! 
When, to the ancient sculptor's gaze, 

The perfect figure, that his art 
Could from the formless marble raise. 

Appeared like light — his bounding heart 
Could not have felt a deeper bliss 

Than when, with life and beauty wami, 
Thy pencil. Sully, traced a form 

So lovely and so true as this ! 



LOVE AND WEALTH. 

A TALE. 

Freely Trafiisluted from the German of Baron Von Biedenfeld. 



BX 51 HS, E. r. ELLET. 



The thunder of battle was suspended, but for a time. Forces were gathered from all quarters to 
take the field again. On the road from Carcassonne to Toulouse all was bustle and tumult; crowds 
of fresh recruits, burning with zeal and hatred of the English, were hastening along with the regular 
troops to join the army of Soult. They were met by many rich proprietors from the borders, who 
were anxious to conceal their wealth in some large city. There were also Bourbonists, known by 
the white 'kerchief — the cockade would have been dangerous ; — and a host of adventurers, with a 
plentiful supply of rogues, sure of finding employment in their pecuHarcaUing. Hundreds of wound- 
ed too were on their way to the great hospital ; some' of the weary soldiers had stopped and rested 
their weapons by a crucifix, on the road side, and were surrounded by the country people ; amidst 
the clamor was heard the cheerful music of a guinguette, and refreshments of all kinds were offered 
in baskets by the peasant women, adorned with their many colored 'kerchiefs, and yet more by their 
dark eyes and olive cheeks. Soon the march was resumed, and as we drew nearer Toulouse, the 
umult and noise increased. The clouds rolled in dark and heavy masses over our heads ; the wind 
surged through the thick boughs of the trees, and covered us with whirling dust. 

We were on foot, and anxious to reach the city before the storm should burst onus. Accident had 
brought so many in company upon the road, we were to take a brief journey together, and each 
probably to forget his anxieties in a cup of wine at the end of it. Nothithstanding our haste to pass 
ihe swollen stream, I could not withdraw my attention from two men among the si range soldiers 
who accompanied us. One was a sturdy figure ; short gambados covered his legs U&gt; the calf, and 
were fastened to the latchet of his shoes by small crosses ; the folds of linen that covered his breast 
were not remarkable for whiteness ; he wore a light blue jacket ornamented with tarnished lace, and 
a short red cloak, which yet had arr air of pretension, with all its poverty. This affectation of smart- 
ness was rendered more striking by the effect of a high, pointed, perforated hat, set jauntily over 
upon the right, and broad golden rings depending from each ear. His naturally brown complexiorr, 
darkened by the sun, his jet-black hair, the large Roman nose, between a pair of restless flashing 
eyes, were not unhandsome, though the countenance was marked by an expieasion of cunning and 
singularity. 

" Who is that 1" asked I, of a Frenchman near me. 

" A half-civilized Spaniard, a Navarrese, from the mountains, who lives by practising all sorts of 
juggling and imposition upon our Southrons, and gains no trifle by his pretensions as a quack doctor 
and conjurer; he sometimes also plays the spy for our army, and 'tis highly probable that he gets 
well paid for the same service by the English and his own countrymen. A Figaro for our modem 
tragedy, in which the merry fellow is called a rascal, in which the joke usually ends by poison and 
Hagger, instead of a marriage." 

" Ha ! ha! ha ! an apt definition !" 

" A true one, of our modern tragedy ; a comedy with melancholy personages, in which the mali- 
cious Harlequin struggles with the fool, till one or the other loses patience, and the worst handled 
atones with his life, A comedy, in which reason belongs only to the multitude, and the enthusiast 
is treated as a blockhead." 

"And who is that tall, slender person, who stoops so much over his handsome horse, and keeps 
Ills large eyes so constantly fixed on the ground." 

" One unfortunate, and yet too happy — a fit hero for the tragedy just mentioned. A young mil- 
lionaire, who would gladly give away his hundreds of thousands, could he get himself with honor 
out of the world, which is arr abomination to him." 

" So handsome, so young, and rich, and yet — a misanthrope 1" 

" You would, perhaps, be the same in his situation ; he is the only child of wealthy parents, and 
had but three passions in his nature: — an idolatrous affection for his mother, ambition for a soldier's 
fame, and devotion to his Emperor, and love for his foster-sister, a peasant girl, in the village we are 
approaching. Mark, how fearfully his heart was wounded through each of these cherished feelings. 
His mother eloped with a PoHsh officer, the very day he had with difficulty obtained from his father 



LOVE AND WEALTH. 201 

permission to follow the Imperial standard to Russia. Could he leave his father alone to join the 
army, perhaps to meet again his abandoned mother 1 He bore his grief in silence ; with bitter tears 
saw the troops depart, while he remained at home with his infirm parent. His love, his Louison, 
was now every thing to him. Deprived of the Epos, he devoted himself to the Idyl. 

" But his father was inexorably opposed to his union with a vinedresser's daughter. He had de- 
signed his only son, with all his wealth, for the daughter of a marshall, one of the new nobility. 
The lovers were constrained to meet clandestinely, and the poor maiden's reputation suffered thereby 
in the eyes of all their acquaintance. 

" Suddenly came the thunderbolt from the blue heavens — that Bulletin from Russia, demanding 
a fresh army from France. The canton furnished one hundred and thirty-four recruits : yonder pale 
youth drew the number one hundred and thirty-four, and Louison's brother the number one hundred 
and thirty-five. The youth hastened to Paris with letters from his father to a counsellor of state, 
and returned to his native place full of eagerness to join the army. The old man received him with 
smiles, all his comrades with anger and scorn ; for slander had been busy with his name. He was 
declared unfit to enter the service ; his foster brother took his place, and he was compelled to bear 
all this in silence, for fear of involving his father in unpleasant difficulties. Louison's joy at his re- 
turn was troubled by sorrow at the departure of her brother. As for her lover, he became a prey to 
deep melancholy. His substitute was obliged to go with the troops to Spain, but returned with con- 
tempt all the money and letters sent him by his rich foster brother. He also enjoined it upon his 
sister to have regard to her own good name, and break off all acquaintance with a dishonored man. 
Louison wept bitterly, but she could not obey at once the hard command ; and love at length obtain- 
ed the victory. She entreated the youth, however, to use all the influence his wealth procured him 
to bring about the release of her brother from his martial duty. Powerful as is the Emperor in the 
field, so in France is his image stamped on a round bit of gold. But neither gold nor Emperor can 
call the dead from their graves. The substitute, the brother of Louison, fell wounded into the hands 
of the Spaniards, and was reported dead. 

" The news drove the melancholy youth frantic. ' I have killed my friend and brother,' was his 
incessant exclamation ; and in imagination he strove with the ghost of the departed, who came to re- 
proach him. The haughty old father was obliged to entreat the poor maiden to come to his house, 
for her presence alone could soothe the frenzy of his unhappy son, or change his madness into tender 
and tearful melancholy. His visits to the vinedresser's house, too, served to divert his mind. Two 
or three times a week he rode thither, unattended by a domestic, taking caie of his horse himself, 
and dining at the inn, usually in sullen silence. Sometimes his attention was excited by the soldiers ; 
he would seek among them and eagerly examine the countenance of any who happened to bear 
number forty-one ; their, disappointed, would turn his horse away, wipe the tears from his eyes, and 
shuddering, murmur. ' 'Tis not he ! Bernard Prany will never return ; I have killed my brother !' " 

During this conversation the Spaniard had come near us, and seemed very attentive to the narra- 
tion — and visibly struck by the mention of the name of Bernard Prany. He looked as if about to 
address us ; hut shook his head doubtfully, snapped bis fingers, and throwing a glance at the pale 
rider, went off humming a tune, and was soon out of our sight. 

In a large hostelry on the road very near La Prouille, where more than six hundred years before, 
St. Dominic founded the cloister for Dominican nuns, without dreamingof the horrors his institution 
would spread over the world ; — in that old, gloomy hostelry, originally no doubt the lodge and hos- 
pital of La Prouille, sate more than sixty men at supper around the great table. At the upper end 
of the apartment, in a deep reverie, pale and motionless, his eyes fixed on the ground, neither eating 
nor drinking, nor taking interest in ought that passed, sate the youth I had seen riding the handsome 
horse ; chance placed us directly opposite him ; but there was no opportunity for conversation, where 
half a hundred Frenchmen were in an apartment together. The uproar was like a cataract in its 
continuity ; at least thirty different voices might be heard speaking in the same instant. 

Suddenly we heard the cry, " Ha ! Rodrigo Bannos ! Welcome to our Spaniard ! Where is the 
fellow ]" All eyes were turned towards the door, through which with mock solemnity entered the 
Spaniard. He rnade his way among the guests, nodding his head repeatedly, and greeting many 
with a friendly grasp ; took his place by the chimney piece, and began eating from his hand a piece 
of mutton with raw onions. 

" "Where have you been, Rodrigo ?" cried one. Before he could reply — another broke in with — 
" About profitable business?" 

" Only the devil now-adays drives a profitable business !" said the Spaniard coolly, without sus- 
pending his meal. 

" Well — you have brought somewhat to entertain us 1" 

" Empty pockets — if you want any juggling. Ha, brisk fellow — you have the cup in your hands 
again 1" 

" Will you drink f 

" Yes — when I have done eating — but only champagne or pure water." 

" Champagne !" roared a dozen voices at once. They rose, and the mirth and tumult increased. 
Only the pale youth gate motionless, his head resting on both hands. It had not escaped me, that 



202 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

at the first glance at Rodrigo he had shuddeied, and grown visibly paler. But no one noticed him,, 
for general attention was drawn to the new comer, 

" Kodrigo !" cried a cracked voice, " we shall not soon have so fine an opportunity as at present; 
bring us up a fev? handsome ghosts." 

" You are mad, man ; beauty belongs to the flesh." 

" A few charming Dominicans of those who sleep in the churchyard at La Prouille, with the pale- 
faces and eyes of fire." 

'» You are all fools, or full of wine; have patience, you will soon enough be side by side with the 
nuns. No more of ghosts and damsels; but I will show you some new conjurer's tricks. Bring 
cards here !" 

Amid approving shouts he began to exhibit several tricks with cards, which he did with much 
dexterity and skill. He made some draw three cards, and told their fortunes, or described the em- 
ployment of some absent friend or relative. Some of his predictions were very apt, for Bannos had 
all the cunning belonging to his profession. 

The silent youth, lifting up his head, seemed attentive to every word and motion of the Spaniard, 
while the latter appeared not to observe him. All at once, however, he went up to him, presented 
his pack of cards, and, while he fixed his flashing eyes full on those of the youth, said in a cheerful 
tone, but not without solemnity — " It is your turn, noble stranger ; draw three cards, and I will tell 
you what is presently to befall you. Many possess thousands, and know not what may happen to 
them the next moment." 

The youth mechanically drew the cards. The first was the ace of hearts, which he laid down on 
the table ; the others were the queen of diamonds and the ace of clubs. 

" By St. James — young man !" cried Rodrigo, after shufiling and examining the cards, and pausing 
a few moments; " you are more fortunate than all the rest ! Your father, at this moment, sits at 
home in his easy chair, reckoning Over his tTiousands, and negotiating for you, his only son, a mar- 
riage with the only daughter of one of the wealthiest men in the kingdom." 

" Biavo ! here's to the golden band !" cried many of the company, laughing. The pale youth 
sprang up, his brow crimson, clutched the Spaniard by the dress — and exclaimed — " you are a liar — 
a villain !" 

" Ha ! let go my jacket, and do not disarrange my cards. Is it my fault that you like Louison 
better than the other rich lady 1 " 

" Louison !" cried the stranger despairingly, and quitting his hold, rushed from the apartment. 

" You struck him to the heart, Rodrigo," said the cracked voice again. "" St. Jean ! had you lived 
in 1789, and prophesied to the people, there would have been some mischief undone, and some drops 
of blood the fewer shed." 

" And some fools the more !" added another of the company ; — and seveial voices cried — " Joli- 
coeur grows sentimental ! ha ! ha! ha ! more wine heie !" 

The uproar soon became so great among the intoxicated guests, that I was glad to make my es-. 
cape unnoticed. 

I sate on one of the garden terraces, and looked up towards the gloomy walls of La Prouille. I 
was not alone — for the six last centuries were with me — and we conversed as cordially as if we had 
drank our coflee every day together. Who can compare without emotion the years 1214 and 1814'? 
In the first all strength was put forth to support the tottering dominion of usurping Rome over 
christian Europe ; the last witnessed the efforts of despair to overthrow the giant of his age. The 
one was the day of monks and monasteries, of interdicts, and feudal power, and knightly combats, 
and the Inquisition and secret tribunals. The other, of steam-boats and steam-presses — of books, 
and a war with the pen as well as the sword ; a parody upon the past feudal time ; the last struggle 
of the old decayed, poetical aristocracy — with the aristocracy of intellect and of wealth, and the boast 
of popular freedom. 

I was roused from a very misanthropical reverie by a rustling below me. The Spaniard and the 
pale youth were engaged in earnest conversation. Neither had observed me. 

"You must — Rodrigo — by heaven, you must!" 

" Indeed, sir, it is beyond my power." 

" It is not ! I myself have laughed a thousand times at the idea of a spirit's re-visiting this world, 
and conversing with the living. But I now take shame foi my childish incredulity. I know well, 
such intercourse is possible; I call upon you to be mediator betwixt the dead and me !" 

" Let me go — you are ill." 

" Be my leech, then, and heal me. A thousand Napoleons are yours, if you show him to me — 
him — only him ! Bid him appear ; speak the word, which calls him out of the grave. Draw the 
circle in which he must rise to my view. He called me a coward ; I must tell him face to face, that 
I am none ! He must retract his words." 

"Ha! ha! ha! so you will challenge the ghost ? Have you your weapons with you 1 Be as- 
sured, arms are not needed in such company." 

" What should I do with armsl My old father will not permit me to use them. I have notbiug 
but gold^gold — even gold." 



LOVE AND WEALTH. 203 

" Ha — have you not love — the joy of love 1" 

" Of love ■? Louison has closed her door against me. I shall never see her more, unless I go to 
lead her to the altar. She has renounced me : her brother called me coward ; my father condemns 
me to misery. I must break his heart or betray my Louison, as I betrayed my Emperor !" 
" Be not foolish. Call you obedience to your father, treachery to the Emperor 1" 
" I have betrayed my country, whose sacred soil is profaned by foes, while I sit in safety, and ban- 
quet at home. Shame lests on me ; interminable shame ; therefore fortune turns her back upon me — 
therefore joy flies my embrace — therefore Louison renounces me — therefore my heart must 

break " 

" You must have blood let, young man ; your veins are too full !" 

" Ah ! my blood belongs to my country — to honor — to my Emperor-; — but I must let it tevel in my 
veins !'' Then, after a pause, he urged moie vehemently — " Callime up Bernard!" 
" Have patience, at least, till another day." 

'•' No — this day — at midnight — I must see him ; I must speak with him ; should I myself go down 
into the grave !" 

" You are too much agitated — such an interview demands calmness." 
" There is calmness only in the grave." 

" And are you fixed in this belief " 

" Fixed 1 there is nothing fixed in this world, save wretchedness, and my undying love !" 
" Come then ! Bernard shall appear to you. Come to me at midnight, to the garden pavilion, 
alone ; and mention to no one what I have said." 

Convinced that some deceit was to be practised upon the poor young stranger, I resolved to watch 
them, and avert the evil, if evil was intended towards him. Just before midnight I repaired to the 
pavilion, and was fortunate enough to discover a spot, where unseen, I could observe all that was 
gping on, and rush to his assistance, should he need my help. 

The window-shutters of the pavihon were closed, but a side door stood partly open. Opposite the 
door, a few steps distant , was a close arbor, within which I concealed myself. The night was mild, 
and a deep stillness reigned around me ; not a breeze was stirring ; — all things seemed wrapped in 
breathless slumber. There was one watcher, however ; I could see the poor youth walking restlessly 
up and down his chamber. I marked the outline of his noble features, every time he passed the 
lamp. 

Alas ! the misdeeds of the wicked too often disturb the repose of the guiltless ; wounding them as 
deeply as if upon them also the poisoned fangs of conscience had laid hold. 

Some wine stood on a table by his window ; he drank frequently, and with impatient gestures. 
Then he looked at his watch. Not yet midnight ! What torture ! He drank again — then paused 
and listened. Eleven and three-quarters struck hoarsely, from the dark oaken clock within the 
hostelry. Yet a quarter of an hour — O martyr of impatience ! Once more he raised the cup to his 
lips. He examined the priming of his pistols; shook his head mournfully, and placed the pistols in 
his bosom. He threw a rich mantle over his shoulders, and unconsciously let it slide off again. He 
opened the window. The fresh air seemed to revive him ; his eyes were raised toward heaven ; — 
his hands rested on the window frame ; he continued to gaze upward, as i f seeking out a path to the 
world beyond reach of the living. 

"There he stands — 'tis he !" suddenly whispered a female voice close to me. 
'• Yes — Louison — 'tis he !" answered the Spaniard, in a low tone. " Yet a few moments, and he 
will come down. Is Bernard in the pavilion — and ready 1" 
" Yes ! Oh, that all were over !" 

" Be rational, Louison ! You behave as if aught else were to happenbut what you most wish !" 
" But if all should fail — if even this scene should not restore the fair light of reason to his soul 1" 
" In such a case, all is no worse than it was before." 

" Alas ! you know not what the worst might be. You love him not, and do not know him thorough- 
ly. I see his whole heart, while I look into my own. I myself had nearly perished in the moment 
when his father's change of purpose was made known to me, and I saw my dearest wishes on the 
eve of fulfilment." 

" We must risk something ; the result is in the hands of Providence. You know the physician's 
assurance, that by such means only, by a powerful shock could reason be restored to her full empire, 
and the gloomy phantoms that so long have haunted him dispelled. You know, too, what has been 

done with a view to this " 

"Ah! me!" 

" Hush — hush — and come with me !" 

The clock in the hostelry struck twelve. In an instant the youth disappeared from the window, 
and the light in his chamber was extinguished. The young girl and the Spaniard also vanished, 
without my observing whither they went. Night and silence were again around me. My heart throbbed 
with anxious expectation. 

The latticed door of the garden creaked on its hinges, and the sand cracked beneath the tread of 
hastening feet. A faint hght was burning in the pavilion, which threw its pale beam on the stranger

youth, approaching with his weapons under his arm. The door of the pavihon closed against him 
lightl}', as if moved by uneaithly hands. All was dark again without. 

" Are you here, Leon Belanger 1" whispered the Spaniard. 

" I am !" was the reply. 

" 'Tis well ; you are on the spot ; stand still ; keep silence, and put on this monk's frock and cowl ; 
that your worldly habiliments frighten not the ghost. But what do you with weapons V 

" I must have satisfaction," replied the youth, gloomily ; " but he shall have the choice of weapons ; 
I have brought swords and pistols." 

" Excellent ! yes ; the spirit must give you satisfaction. But till he appears, you must have no 
metal about your person. It will render the spells ineffectual. Lay them aside. Right ; now your 
purse. Is it done 1" 

'•Yes — what more is necessary 1" 

" Silence and patience, whatever you may see and hear." 

The conjurer then began, half singing, half murmuring, to repeat words in an unknown tongue, 
walking round the youth with earnest and mysterious gesticulation. As he passed, nine blue flames 
sprang from the ground in the circle, and nine columns of dense smoke rose upwards. Rodrigo wore 
a long dark frock, and a dark cap covered his head. The youth on the other hand was wrapped in 
a white robe ; his brow was fevered ; his keen eyes were fixed intently on the door of the pavilion, 
his arms crossed on his breast. As the ninth flame rose, the conjurer raised both hands to his waist, 
and on his broad girdle streamed out strange figures and characters in phosphoric brilliance, and a 
burning star shone on his breast. He sank on his knee and repeated the form of adjuration, calling 
on the dead to awake. 

When the verses were ended, a rusthng was heard, and the folding doors flew open. A flood of 
light poured out ; clouds of soft fragrance floated around them, and reflected on their purple edges the 
brightness with which the walls within shone. Both figures were distinctly visible in the strange 
light; the Spaniard in his daik dress, and the tall, white, spectral figure of the young stranger. I 
was so overpowered by the sui prise, that though I was sensible of the trick, my eyes were nearly 
blinded ; and I stood breathless and disconcerted, as if the mysteries of the grave were really about 
to be revealed. 

The conjurer resumed his metrical chant; and summoned Bernard Prany to appear. Leon re- 
peated the words after him in a stern and solemn tone. The flames vanished from the circle, the 
star on Rodrigo's breast grew paler ; the bright characters on his girdle faded, and at the end it was 
quite dark within and without. At this moment the note of an owl was heard from the roof of the 
building ; his wild hoarse scream seemed to me to utter a warning ! 

I heard a quick gliding step close beside me, among the rosebushes, which staitled me so that I 
was near betraying myself by an involuntary outcry. It was Louison, the expectant, anxious, trembling, 
Louison. How her heart beat, how her bosom heaved with her hurried breathing — how eagerly did 
she bend forward — her straining eyes fixed only upon her lover ! 

There was another burst of light ; and on the threshhold of the pavilion stood a young French 
soldier, with a red scar across his pale forehead. His eyes sought the poor Leon, who stood gazing 
at him wildly, in vain endeavoring to collect his strength to speak. At length the spell was broken. 
" Bernard !" faltered he, and covered his face with both hands, in unspeakable emotion. " Leon !" 
answered the soldier, much moved ; but a sign from the conjurer checked the words on his lips, and 
he remained silent. 

" You called me a villain, Bernard," continued Leon — " a coward — while you yet breathed the 
breath of life. Bernard ! I am no coward ! Spirit of my brother — I demand of you — I conjure 
you — look in my heart — see if one drop of cowardice runs in my veins ! Bernard ! I — wo is me ! — 
Louison — Louison " 

He staggered, unable to support himself; Louison gave a scream, and rushed to his side ; Bernard 
came down to his assistance. Before they could reach him, he fell, and his forehead struck the cold 
ground. 

An old man, whom I had not before observed, rushed out from the bushes behind the young girl. 
He pushed the others aside, and with a piercing cry — " Leon! my son !" threw himself on his knees, 
and lifting up the head of the lifeless youth, supported him in his arms. " Awake, rise, my son !" 
he cried again. " Come hither, Louison ! my daughter ! Leon ! she is yours; she loves you ! dost 
hear, Leon 1 She is yours — and Bernard has to crave your forgiveness ! He lives — he is your 
brother ! Help — help ! Leon ! your father calls — awake !" 

But Leon awaked not. 

" Dead !" shrieked the maiden, and her heart broke with that word. " I — renounced — I have 
killed him !" And she sank breathless upon the corpse. 

******** 

On the the third day after, they laid the two lovers side by side, in the same cold grave, and no- 
thing remained to the rich, haughty father, of his only son, save agonizing remembrance, and a too 
late remorse.

what say of it ? what say of Conscience grim. 

That spectre in my path ? — Chamber laine's PItarronida. 



Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now lying before me need 
not be sullied with my real appellation. This has been already too much an object for the scorn, for 
the horror, for the detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the in- 
dignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy 1 Oh, outcast of all outcasts most abandoned ! To 
the earth art thou not for ever dead 1 to its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations 1 and a 
cloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven 1 

I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery, 
and unpardonable crime. This epoch — these later years — took unto themselves a sadden elevation 
in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base by de- 
grees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. I shrouded my nakedness 
in triple guilt. From comparatively tiivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more 
than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance, what one event brought this evil thing to 
pass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches ; and the shadow which foreruns him has 
thrown a softening influence over ray spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the 
sympathy — I had nearly said for the pity — of my fellow-men. I would fain have them believe that 
I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish 
them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis oi fatality amid a wilder- 
ness of error. I would have them allow — what they cannot refrain from allowing — that, although 
temptation may have etewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before — cen- 
tainly, never thus fell. And therefore has he never thus suffered. Have I not indeed been living in 
a dream 1 And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all 
sublunary visions 1 

I am come of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered 
them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family 
character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed ; becoming, for many reasons, a 
cause of serious disquietude to ray friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, ad- 
dicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and 
beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil 
propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure 
on their part, and of course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward ray voice was a household 
law ; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance 
of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions. 

My earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large, rambling, cottage-built, and 
somewhat decayed building in a misty-looking village of England, where weie a vast number of 
gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient and inordinately tall. 
In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, 
in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its 
thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep, hollow note of the 
chuich-bell, breaking each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmos- 
phere in which the old, fretted, Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep. 

It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience, to dwell upon 



206 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

minute recollections of the school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am — misery, alas ! only 
too real — I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a 
few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, 
to my fancy, adventitious importance as connected with a period and a locaUty, when and where I 
recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me. 
Let me then remember. 

The house, I have said, was old, irregular, and cottage-built. The grounds were extensive, and 
an enormously high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed 
the whole. This prison-hke rampart formed the limit of our domain ; beyond it we saw but thrice 
a week — once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take 
brief walks in a body through some of the neighboring fields — and twice during Sunday, when we 
were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of 
the village. Of this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder 
and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the galler}', as, with step solemn 
and slow, he ascended the pulpit ! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with 
robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast — 
could this be he who of late, with som- visage, and in snuffy habUiments, administered, ferule in hand, 
the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox too utterly monstrous for solution ! 

At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was riveted and studded 
with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe it inspired ! 
It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned ; then, 
in every creak of its mighty hinges we found a plentitude of mystery, a world of matter for solemn 
remark, or for far more solemn meditation. 

The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of these, three 
or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. 
I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor any thing similar within it. Of course it was in 
the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs ; but through 
this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed, such as a first advent to school or 
final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, v/e joyfully took 
our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holydays. 

But the house — how quaint an old building was this! — to me how veritably a palace of enchant- 
ment ! There was really no end to its windings, to its incomprehensible sub-divisions. It was im- 
possible, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. 
From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or 
descent. Then the lateral branches were innumerable — inconceivable — and so returning in upon 
themselves, that oui most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different 
■from those with which we pondered upon infinity. During tlie five years of my residence here I was 
never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment as- 
signed to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars. 

The school-room was the largest in the house — I could not help thinking in the world. It was 
very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a re- 
mote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, 
" during hours," of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy 
door, sooner thaVi open which in the absence of "the Dominie," we would all have willingly perish- 
ed by the pei7ie forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, in- 
deed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of" the classical" usher, one of 
the " English and mathematical." Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless 
irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately 
with much-bethumbed books, and so heseamed with initial letters, names at full length, meaningless 
gashes, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little 
of original form might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water 
stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other. 

Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy Ipassed, yet not in tedium or disgust, 
the years of the third lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world 
of incident to occupy or amuse it, and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with 
more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or ray full manhood from 
Clime, Yet I must believe that my first mental developement had in it much of the uncommon, 
even much of the outre. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in 
mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow — a weak and irregular remembrance — an 
indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In 
childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines 
as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of the Carthaginian medals. 

Yet in fact — in the fact of the world's view — how little was there to remember ! The morning's 
awakening, the nightly summons to bed ; the connings, the recitations ; the periodical half-holidays 
and perambulations ; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues — these, by a raentil 



WILLIAM WILSON. 207 

sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incidi nt, an 
u)iiverse of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring. " Oh, le bon temps, 
que ce siecle de fer .'" 

In truth, the ardency, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition soon rendered me 
a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow but natural gradations, gave me an ascen- 
dency over all not greatly older than myself— over all with one single exception. This exception 
was found in the person of a scholar, who although no relation, bore {lie same Christian and sur- 
name as myself — a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable, for, notwithstanding a noble descent, 
mine was one of those every-day appellations which se&lt;;m, by prescriptive right, to have been, time 
out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself 
as William Wilson — a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of those 
who in school phiaseolegy constituted " our set," presumed to compete with me in the studies of the 
class, in the spoi ts and broils of the pla^'-ground — to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and sub- 
mission to my will — indeed to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If 
there be on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind in boy- 
hood over the less energetic spirits of its companions. 

Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarra-ssrnent-^the more so as, in spite of 
the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly fglt 
that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality Vv-hich he maintained so easily with my- 
self, a proof of his true superiority, since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this 
sijperiority — even this equality — was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, 
by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his re- 
sistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more 
pointed than private. He appeared to be utterly destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of 
the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been s.iip- 
pogcd actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there 
were times when I could not help obaervifig, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, 
that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and 
ass.uredly roost unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only conceive this singular beha- 
viour to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection. 
Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the 
mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that 
we were brothers, among the senior classes in the acfidemy. These do not usually inquire with 
much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson 
w^s not, in the most, remote degree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been 
brothers we must ha^e heeri twins, for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually learned that my name- 
sake — a somewhat remarkable coincidence — was born on the niireteenth of January, 1811-^-and this 
is precisely the day of my own nativity. 

It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, 
aQd his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, 
to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel, in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in 
sQine manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride 
ii.pon my part, aiid a veritable dignity upon his own, kept us always upon what are called "speaking 
terms," while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in 
rne a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into fiiendship. It is 
difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards him. They were forrned of 
a, heterogeneous mixture — some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteerh, more 
respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist fully acquainted with the 
njtinute spirings of human action, it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself 
were the most inseparable of companions. 

It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us which turned all my attacks 
upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke 
(giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into that of a more serious and de- 
termined hostility. But my endeavors on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even 
when my plans were the most wittily concocted ; for my namesake had much about him, in character, 
of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has 
no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one 
vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, 
would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself — my rival had a weak- 
ness in the faucial or guttural organs which precluded liim from raising his voice at any time above 
a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power. 

Wilson's retaliations in kind were many, and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed 

me beyond measure. How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is 

a question I never could solve — but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance. I 

l^ad always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plefjpian, prae-

nomen. The words were venom in my ears ; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second 
"William Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly 
disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, 
who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school 
business, must, inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my 
own. 

The feeUng of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circu mstance tending to show 
resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the re- 
markable fact that we were of the same age ; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I per- 
ceived that we were not altogether unlike in general contour of person and outline of feature. I was 
galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms. In 
a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously concealed such disturb- 
ance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in 
truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the 
case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, oi even observed 
at all by our school-fellows. That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was appa- 
rent, but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance for myself can 
only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration. 

His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words and in actions ; and most 
admirably did he play his part. My dress it was an easy matter to copy ; my gait and general man- 
ner, were, without difficulty, appropriated ; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did 
not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key, it was identical ; 
and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo of my own. 

How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not justly be termed a ca- 
ricature,) I will not now venture to describe. I had but one consolation — in the fact that the imita- 
tion, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and 
strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom 
the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was charac- 
teristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavors might have 
so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and 
participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the 
gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible, or, more possibly I owed my security to 
the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, which in a painting is all the obtuse can 
see, gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin. 

I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed to- 
wards me, and of his frequent officious interference with my will. This interference often took the 
ungracious character of advice ; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it 
with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do 
Mm the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival 
■were on the side of those eriors or follies so usual to his immature age, and seeming inexperience ; 
that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my 
own ; and that I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I more seldom re- 
jected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated, and 
too bitterly derided. 

As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme, under his distasteful supervision, and daily 
resented more and more openly what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in 
the first years of our connexion as school-mates, my feelings in regard to him might have been easily 
ripened into friendship ; but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the in- 
trusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly 
similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, 
and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me. 

It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an altercation of violence with him, 
in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of 
demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and 
general appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing 
to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy — wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when 
memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than 
by saying that I could with difficulty shake off the belief that myself and the being who stood before 
jne had been acquainted at some epoch very long ago ; some point of the past even infinitely remote. 
The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came ; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the 
last conversation I there held with my singular namesake. , 

The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several enormously large chambers com- 
municating with each other, where slept the greater number of the students. There were, however, 
as must necessaiily happen in a building so awkwardly planned, many little nooks or recesses, the 
«dds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up 



WILLIAM WILSON. 209 

as dormitories — although, being the merest closets, they were capable of accommoilating only a single 
individual. One of these small apaitments was occupied by Wilson. 

It was upon a gloomy and tempestuous night of an early autumn, about the close of my fifth year 
at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, that, finding every one wrapped 
in sleep, I aiosc from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from 
ray own bed-room to that of my rival. I had been long plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of 
practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my in- 
tention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I leso'ved to make him feel the whole extent of 
the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the 
lamp with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tran- 
quil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approach- 
ed the bed. Close curtains v/ere around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly 
withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon 
his countenance. I looked, and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My 
breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable 
honor. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these — 
these the lineaments of William Wilson 1 I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as with a 
fit of the ague in fancying they were not. What was there about them to confound me in this 
manner 1 I gazed — while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he 
appeared — assuredly not thus — in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name ; the same 
contour of person; the same day of arrival at the academy ! And then his dogged and meaningless 
imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner ! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of 
human possibility that what I now luitnessed was the result of the habitual practice of this sarcastic 
imitation! Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently 
from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again. 

After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton. 
The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or 
at least, to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them. 
The truth — the tragedy — of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence 
of my senses ; and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credu- 
lity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. Neither was 
this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The 
■vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away 
all but the froth of my past hours — engulfed, at once, every solid or serious impression, and left to 
memory only the veriest levities of a former existence. 

I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here — a profligacy which 
set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed 
without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusal degree, to 
my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dis- 
solute students to a secret carousal in my chamber. We met at a late hour of the night, for our 
debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The wine flowed freely, and there were 
not wanting other, perhaps more dangerous, seductions ; so that the gray dawn had already faintly 
appeared in the east, while our dehrious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed with cards 
and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than intolerable profanity, when 
my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the 
apartment, and by the eager voice from without of a servant. He said that some person, apparently 
in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall. 

W^ildly excited with the potent Vin de Barac, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than 
surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the build- 
ing. In this low and small room there hung no lamp ; and now no light at all was admitted, save 
that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through a semicircular window. As I put 
my foot over the thrcshhold I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and (what 
then peculiarly struck my mad fancy) habited in a white cassimere morning frock, cut in the novel 
fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me tc perceive — but 
the features of his face I could not distinguish. Immediately upon my entering he strode hurriedly 
up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gestuie of petulant impatience, whispered the words 
" William Wilson I" in my ear. I grew perfectly sober in an instant. 

There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, 
as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement — but it 
was not this which had so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the 
singular, low, hissing utterance ; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of those few, 
simple, and familiar, yet whispered, syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of 
by-gone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recovei 
the use of my senses he was gone. 

Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon mv disordered imagination, yet was it evanes-

cent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud 
of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular 
individual who thus perseveiingly interfered with my affairs, and haiassed me with his insinuated 
counsel. But who and what was this Wilson 1 — and whence came hel — and what were his pur- 
poses 1 Upon neither of these points could I be satisfted — merely ascertaining, in regard to him, 
that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's Academy on the 
afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the 
subject ; ray attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon 
went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit, and annual establishment, 
which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart — to vie in pro- 
fuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain, 

Excited by such appliances to vice, mj constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled 
ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. 
But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spend thrifts 
I out-heioded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix 
to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe. 

It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly 
estate as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become 
an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already 
enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians. Such, neverthe- 
less, was the fact. And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honorable sentiment 
proved, beyond doubt, the main, if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed. 
Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evi- 
dence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses the gay, the fiank, the generous W^illiam 
W^ilson — the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford — him whose follies (said his parasites) 
were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy — whose errors but inimitable whim — whose darkest 
vice but a careless and dashing extravagance 1 

I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a 
young parve7iu nobleman, Glendlnning — rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus — his riches, too, as 
easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject 
for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with a gambler's usual art, to letliim 
win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle Jiim in my snares. At length, my schemes 
being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the 
chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him 
justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I 
had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the 
introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated 
dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon 
similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its 
victim. 

We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manceuvre of 
getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite ecaite. The rest of 
the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were stand- 
ing around us as spectators. The parveiiii, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part 
of the evening to diink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for 
which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether, account. In a very short 
period he had become my debtor to a large amount of money, when, having taken a long draught of 
port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating, he proposed to double our already extravagant 
stakes. With a well feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced 
him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. 
The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils — in less than a single 
hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge 
lent it by the wine — but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly 
fearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as im- 
measurably wealthy ; and the suras which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, 
I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the 
wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to 
the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested mo- 
tive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions 
at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of 
Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, 
rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill oflSces even of a 
fiend. 

What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable condition of my d^jpe 
had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all, and, for some moments, a profound and unbroken

silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many 
burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even 
own that an intalcrible weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sud- 
den and extraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy, folding doors of the apartmen 
were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that ex- 
tinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to per- 
ceive that a stranger had entered of about my own height, and closely muffled in a cloak. The dark 
ness, however, was now total ; and we could only feel that he vvas standing in our midst. Before 
any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, 
wc heard the voice of the intruder. 

" Gentlemen" — he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the 
very manow of my bones — " Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behavior, because in thus be- 
having I am but fuliilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the 
person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum of money from Lord Glcndinning. I will there- 
fore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information. 
Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cufi" of his left sleeve, and the several little 
packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning 
wrapper." 

While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin dropping upon the 
floor. In ceasing, he at once departed, and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I — shall T describe 
my sensations ] — must I say that I felt all the horrors of the dammed ? Most assuredly I had but 
little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were im- 
mediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were found all of the court-cards 
essential in ecarte, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, fac-similes of those used 
at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, iechmcaWj , arrondees ,- 
the honors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this 
disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the breadth of the pack, will invariably find that he 
cuts his antagonist an honor ; while the gambler, cutting at the length, will, as certainly, cut no- 
thing for his victim which may count in the records of the game. 

Any outrageous burst of indignation upon this shameful discovery would have affected me less 
than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure with which it was received. 

" Mr. Wilson," said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious 
cloak of rare furs, " Mr. Wilson, this is your property," (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting 
my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene 
of play.) " I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter 
smile,) for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed we have had enough. You will see the ne- 
cessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford — at all events, of quitting, instantly, my chambers." 

Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling 
language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested, 
by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of 
fur ; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own 
fantastic invention; for I was fastidious, to a degree of absurd coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous 
nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and 
near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, 
that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) 
and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible 
particular. The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remember- 
ed, in a cloak ; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the excep- 
tion of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston, placed it, 
unnoticed, over my own, left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance, and, next morning ere 
dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror 
and of shame. 

1 Jledin vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and proved, indeed, that the exer- 
cise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun. Sftarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had 
fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew, while I 
experienced no relief. Villain ! — at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officious- 
ness, stepped he in between me and my ambition ! At Vienna, too, at Berlin, and at Moscow ! 
Where, i» truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart 1 From his inscrutable tyianny 
did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence ; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain. 
And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I demand the questions 
" Who is hel — whence came he 1 — and what are his objects V But no answer was there found. 
And now I scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits 
of his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. 
It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in which he bad of late crossed 
my path, had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, fully

canied out, miglil ha'^'e resulted in bitter mischief. Pooi justification this, in truth, for an authority so im- 
periously assumed ! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly de- 
nied ! 

I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period of time, (while scrupu- 
lously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) 
had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any 
moment, the features of his face. . Be Wilson what he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of 
affectation, or of folly. Could, he for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton, in 
the destroyei of my honor at Oxford, in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge in 
Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt, that in this, my 
arch-enemy and evil genius, I could fail to recognise the William Wilson of my schoolboy days, the 
namesake, the companion, the rival, the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's ? Impossible ! — 
But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama. 

Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The sentiments of deep awe 
■with which I habitually Cegarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omni- 
presence and omnipotence of W^ilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other 
traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea 
of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant 
submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine ; and its 
maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. 
I began to murmur, to hesitate, to resist. And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, 
with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution 1 
Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured in 
my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no longei to be enslaved. 

It was at Rome, during the carnival of 18 — , that I attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the 
Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine- 
table ; and now the suffocating atn;osphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance. 
The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to 
the ruffling of my temper ; for I was anxiously seeking, let me not say with what unworthy motive, 
the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too unscrupulous 
confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would 
be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into 
her presence. At this moment I felt alight hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, 
low, damnable whisper within my eai. 

In a perfect whirlwind of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me, and 
seized him violently by the collar. He was attired, as I had expected, like myself; wearing a large 
Spanish cloak, and a mask of black silk which entirely covered his features. 

" Scoundrel!" I said, in a "oice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new 
fuel to my fury, " scoundrel ! impostor ! accursed villain I you shall not — you shall not dog me unto 
death ! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand," and I broke my way from the room into a small 
antechamber adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went. 

Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the wall, while I closed the 
door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant, then, with a 
slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence. 

The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within 
my single arm the energy and the power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer 
strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute 
ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom. 

At this instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and 
then immediately returned to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately 
portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view. 
The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material 
change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror, it appeared to 
me, now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of 
teiror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced, with a feeble and 
tottering gait, to meet me. 

Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my ant-igonist — it was Wilson, who then stood before 
me in the agonies of his dissolution. Not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of that face 
which was not, even identically, mine own ! His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, 
upon the floor. 

It was Wilson, but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have fancied that I myself was 
speaking while he said — 

" You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead — dead to the world 
and its hopes. In me didst thou exist — and, in my death, see by this image, lohich is thine own, 
how utterly thou hast murderti thyself." 



THE FRENCH JEW; 

OK, "KILLING TIME" IN THE JERSIES 
Taken Down from the Mouth of Tom King. 



BY THE AUTHOR OF iAFITTE. 



« Who is Tom King ]" 

Marry come up ! not to know Tom King, thou art thyself unknown. I will tell thee, and so en- 
lighten thy ignorance. Tom King is a wit and a wag — a gentleman of infinite humor, and over- 
running with mirth. His head is as crammed with funny stories and humorsome anecdotes of his 
own time, as is a Quaker's measure with good wheat when he heapeth it up and runneth it over. 
He is past forty, yet he hath the juvenility of twenty ; his jocund phiz giving the lie to full the half 
of his years. He loveth a good dinner ; rejoiceth in good wines, and holdeth fast on good company — 
or, rather, it is the good company that hold fast upon him ; for few that get him at their table, are 
■willing soon to let him off. Ah ! he is a gentleman of infinite jest, Tom ! I wish you could see 
him tell one of his stories — see him, I repeat, for he talks with his face and twinkling gray eyes bet- 
ter than with his tongue, and that he knoweth how to use most cunningly for our divertisement. 
Oh, he is a lare wag ! He will make your eyes run over — not with tears of sorrow, (for grief and 
Tom King are strangers,) but with tears that are the expressed essence of delight. Thou hast not 
seen hira neither 1 He carrieth himself, then, with a goodly height, being five feet nine, his abdo- 
men of a rotund shape, like a full wine skin, and his face hath that round fullness that good natured 
men do often show. His profile is like unto Bonaparte's, more so than any man's living, probably ; 
in support of which assertion, I will mention that the count Survilliers spoke of it one day when 
Tom called on him to ask leave to shoot woodcock on his grounds eight days before the fourth of 
July. He loves to stand with his arms folded across his chest, a la Napoleon, and, assuming the 
proper attitude, give you what he calls Napoleon en bivouac,- and, my ceites, when you look at Tom 
in this attitude, you would swear a little distance off he was Nappy himself. Tom has two profile 
portraits hanging in his bed room, each side of the mantel-piece — one of Napoleon cut from a book, 
the other of himself, done by an itinerant genius with a pair of scissors, for which Tom paid him 
the sum of twenty-five cents ; and the two are, in 'ventj, as like each other as two peas. Tom used 
to live in town ; but the gout growing upon him, for which the doctors recommended the country, 
and the New Albany bank having made him a little sore by a fall of stock, he left the city for a 
■white cottage on a hill half a mile beyond the last house in the suburbs, with a patch of seven acres 
about it. Here he took to farming on a scale commensurate with the breadth of his acres. Having 
a rare gift of foresight, he planted the morus multicaulis ten years before people began to think of 
it, and put his trees in market ; but nobody offering to buy, he rooted up the whole plantation, and 
filled a dry ditch with the trees. Alas, poor Tom ! he was fifteen years too early in the field. He 
could have made a fortune now with his multicaulis trees if he had them, selling each shoot for a 
dollar. But Tom got the fever prematurely. After the failure of his morus multicauHs, Tom began 
to speculate in cabbages ; and with his own hands transplanted eight rows reaching from one ex- 
tremity of his seven acre lot to the other. But one night his cows got in and ate up all but five of 
the plants, and these Tom tore up himself, to make, as he said, a " clean sweep" of it. Although 
his farming speculations have not turned out as well as might be expected, working in the fresh loam 
has quite cured Tom of his gout, and has given a fine healthy tan to his complexion. 

How Tom came to be travelHng in a stage coach between Philadelphia and New York he has 
never told ; but it is sufficient for our purpose to know that he did once travel so, and that of the 
adventure related in the following dramatic sketch " he was a part." The months of October and 
November, be it premised, for the better understanding of Tom's story, have been, time out of mind, 
"killing time" in New Jersey. At this eventful season, from Cape May to her northern boundary, 
from the Delaware to the ocean that laves her eastern shoie, there is one universal squeal within her 
■borders: while the rivulets run swine's blood, and men go about every where with ensanguined

knives in their right hands, and weaiing long white frocks, spotted with the blood of porkers. It 
was, then, in the latter part of November, 1822, that a stage filled with passengers took its depai- 
ture from the " Indian Queen" hotel, in Philadelphia, on its way to New York. At this period, 
when the land was innocent of steamboats and railroads, the journey between the two cities, which 
is now performed in less than six hours, occupied the best part of three days, especially when the 
roads, as their condition now was, chanced to be heavy. Among the passsengers in the stage was 
our friend Tom King. 

" After we left the city," says Tom, " I began to take a view of my fellow-travellers. None of 
them are worth particularizing, though all well enough in their way, save a cadaverous Frenchman, 
who sat vis a vis with me on the middle window seat, I being stowed in a corner on the front seat. 
His extraordinarjr appearance instantly struck me, filling me at once with wonder and entertainment; 
for he was a bird of the sort that I looked to hy.ve no little amusement out of before we got to our 
journey's end. I took a survey of his person and apparel. He was about six feet in height, stand- 
ing, with a long face, a la General Jackson, a high wrinkled forehead, an eagle's beak shaped nose, 
large lips and mouth, and a pair of little, keen, snaky, black eyes, surmounted by bushy black eye- 
brows, with whiskers and moustache to match. His complexion was very dark, and from the gene- 
ral character of his physiognomy, I knew he was a French Jew. Beneath a little cloth cap he wore 
a red bandanna handkerchief, tied smoothly on his crown. His lean, gaunt frame was encased in a 
long waisted, gray, French surtout, buttoned up to his throat in a military style, while thick knit 
gloves protected his hands from the cold. Seeing me so attentively observing him, he called up to 
his features a sickly, yet courteous, smile, and with the air of one who sought sympathy and desired 
to be social, addressed me in bad English — 

" ' Sare, eet ish verra foin veddare, is lie not "' 

" ' Yes, sir, very good weather.' 

" ' Von leetle cold,' with a slight shrug, 'ish he not, sare V 

" ' Yes, sir,' I replied, quietl}'. 

" ' Eh, bien ! vill you obligshe me. Monsieur., to tak' von pinshe of de snoif '?' he continued, hand- 
ing to me, as a farther incentive to social feelings, an antiquated, heavy silver box, half filled with 
rappee. 

" ' Do you go all de vays to Newe Yorrk V he asked, as he returned the box to his surtout pocket. 

" ' Yes, sir.' 

" ' You live in dish countiee, sare 1' 

« ' Yes, sir.' 

" ' 'Tish verra sangulare de vay dat you 'ave to live here. C^est une chose tres drole.' 

" ' In what way, sir V 

" ' Mais ! c'est une chose si drole /' and he laughed such a laugh as famine herself would have ut- 
tered — a laugh in which there was any thing but droll. 

"'Howdroin' 

" ' Ah, 7non dieuf In Ais pays — dis countree i&gt;ous mangez rien — noting but cochon — 'hog.' 

" ' My dear sir, why, what do you mean by our having nothing to eat here but pork V I ask^d of 
him. 

" ' Ecoutez! Listen done. Monsieur,' he said,^with indignant animation. ' Quandje quittais Pa- 
ris, je me irouvais en hon point. Eh, bien! Je me trouvais myself id — mais! gentilmen,' inter- 
rupting himself, and looking round upon all in the stage, as if he desired their attention ; ' I vill 
tellee you all vat it ish. I come to dis countree, I land in Newe Yorrk, and I go to Philadelfie from 
dere. I have some little lettare d' introduction. I don't know no bodee in dis countree, mafoi! 
Bien! I come to Pheeladelfie and I bring some lettares to some of de principle peoples dere. Eh, 
Men! Dey say to me, after talk som toime, you go Mishtress Vebb, de best boardin' house in Phee-

which I look. Now I go back to Newe Yorrk, I am all-e-mostee starve I' Here his voice became 
exceedingly sad and touching, and he looked as if he could weep his spirit from his eyes. While 
throwing open his surtout, he knocked his knuckles, in attestation of the truth of his words, against 
his ribs and stomach till the one rattled audibly, and the other gave back a hollow, empty sound. 

" ' Eh ! you see dat 1 You hear dat, ma foi V 

He looked round with sad triumph to see the effect produced, and then slowly rebuttoning the 
surtout, added, with a sign, as he fastened the last button — 

" ' Ah, jentilmen, you would not believe you see me in Paris dis a way (filling his stomach with 
wind and swelling out) and you look at me now \ Drivare !' he suddenly called, thrusting hi? head 
out of the window, ' drivare, how far he is to Bristole V 
" ' Short distance, sir,' repUed the respectful Jarvey. 



THE FRENCH JEW. 215 

" ' Alais, ionneur de Dieu/ I vas een Bristolc vonce vcn I com frome Newe Yorrk. Dey givee 
me evra ting dat vas nice ! Dey givee me roastec bif — dey give shickens and ponime de terre, and 
all sorts of noting. Bien, Bristole be von nice place !' And rubbing his hands and moistening his 
lips, with anticipation of the good things that would fall to his share in Bristol, he closed his eyes 
and gave himself up to (by the still smile about his mouth) a delicious reverie. 

" By and by, the roofs and towers of Bristol appeared, and, as if scenting ' roastee bif afar off, the 
Frenchman opened his eyes, and thrust his head out of the window. 

" ' Vat place is dat, drivare, eh V 

'' ' Bristol, sir.' 

" ' Ah, ha ! den I know I get someting to eat. Now, jentilmen, I tellee you I 'ave som meat 
dare. Ven I vas dere I 'ave got roastee bif, roastee shickens — ah, Bristole de good place.' 

" The coach rattles up to the principal hotel, and ere the horses were reined up, out briskly steps 
the jocund landlord. The Frenchman, taking ofl' his hat, instantly thrust his red bandaged head 
from the window. """ ■ 

" ' Ah, Monsieur Bizanet, ah, ha ! I so glad to see you. I 'ave been in dis countree eight veek ; 
for six veek my landladee givee me noting but pork. Now, sare, ven I vas here som toirae dis seven 
veek ago, you giv me som verra nice dinnare — roastee bif, shicken, and every ting nice dat vas good. 
Naw, Monsieur Bizanet, I am almostee starve. Six veek my landladee give me noting but pork — 
all de time, poik — and I hate de pork as I do ze devvil. Now, Monsieur Bizanet, vat you giv uz 
for de dinnare, eh V 

" As he put this query, he stepped out of the coach, and approached the landlord, rubbing his 
hands together with great gout. 

'■ ' Ah, Monsieur Bizanet, vot is it dat you have goode for me, nov/ V 

" ' Well, sir,' said Bezinet, with a great pomposity of manner, like a host confident in the quality 
and abundance of his larder, ' well, sir, we have some very fine tender loins.' 

" ' Tendare loing — don' knaw vat he is, but I sposhe he ish som ting verra goode. Naw, jentil- 
men,' he added, with an expression of much pleasure on his hungry visage, ' naw you tak all de 
Oder tings ; I tak de tendare loing for my share. Vaitare, give me glass brandy vater,' he cried, en- 
tering the bar-room, his stomach growing brave and dilating with anticipation. 

" After drinking his 'brandy vater' with great apparent satisfaction, he took his station at the dining- 
room door opening towards the kitchen, and surveyed with great complacency each dish as it was 
carried in, though he knew not the meats of which any of them consisted. When he found, by 
glancing back to the kitchen, that no more were to come he skipped into the dining-room, and placed 
himself in a seat to which the landlord pointed him. Now be it known to the hitherto uninformed, 
that in ' killing time,' landlords give, literally, nothing but pork, cooked different ways — spare-ribs, 
tender-loins, pork-chops, pork-steaks, sausages, kidneys, souse, hog's-head, hog's-head cheese, and, in 
fine, ' noting but pork.' 

" ' Naw, Monsieur Bizanet, I am so glad to see you ! Ah, Monsieur Bizanet, vere is de tendare 
loing V and his eyes wandered eagerly over the various modificntions of grunter which loaded the 
table. 

" ' There it is, sir, [before you,' said the polite landlord, with a slight bow and gesture with liis 
right hand. 

" ' Ah, bien, bien/' replied Monsieur, delightedly ; and with the eager satisfaction of a half-starved 
wretch, he seized his knife and fork, and commenced cutting into it. Suddenly he stops, raises the 
knife, and then the fork, to his nose, smells and snuffs, snuffs and smells, and then quickly drops 
them upon his plate, and pushes back from the table with an expression of misery and despair. Yet 
it is only suspicion. 

" ' Monsieur Bizanet ! Qu'est ce que c'est diable.' tendare loing 1 Vat is he de tendare loing 1 
Tellee me vat he is made of, Monsieur Bizanet V 

" ' Why, sir, that is acknowledged by epicures to be the choicest part of the hog.' 

" With a look of mingled anguish and horror, he clasped his bony hands together, and for a mo- 
ment appeared the perfect image of wo. 

" \aitare," he said, at length, rising and turning to the waiter, and speaking in the subdued voice 
of patient suffering, his flexible features twisted into almost a cry ; ' Vaitare, 'ave you noting else 
but de porkl' 

" ' No, sir.' 

" ' Veil, den, villee you bringee me glass brandy vater, som onion and cracker 1 I am almostee 
starve. I 'ave live in Philadelfie wid my landladie six veek, and she give me noting but de pork — 
I almostee starve ! I come to Monsieur Bizanet, and he giv me noting but de pork. Tonneur de 
dieu/' 

" Having, as he dilated on his wrongs, grown ireful, and ended thus with a deep oath, he strode 
to the bar and received his ' brandy vater, som onion and cracker,' and sitting down in a comer, 
with his handkerchief spread across his knees, dined solitary and alone. He was yet engaged in 
his frugal repast when the stage-horn wound sharp and loud, and with an onion in one hand, and a 



216 

fragment of cracker in the other, he took his seat beside his fellow-passengers, and the stage once 
more rolled on its way. 

" ' Never mind, eir,' says Tom King, putting on a face full of sympathy, ' never mind it ; wait 
till we get to Trenton.' 

" ' Trantong ! Ai dat ish de place vere de prison is ! I see him ven I com on from. Newe Yorrk. 
Mais, dis done, vere we is now V 

" ' Ten miles off.' 

" ' Ah, Trantong ! I stop dere at Monsieur Bispham, vere I get some ting verra good to eat, I tell 
you. Now, jentilmen, ven ve get dere you may take de tendare loing, and I take som oder ting 
goode.' 

" By and by, the stage begins to descend a hill towards a covered bridge stretched across the De- 
laware, and on the opposite shore appears in full view a large town. 

" ' Drivare,' cried Monsieur, thrusting his head out of the stage window, ' drivare, tellee me vat 
place he is, eh V 

" ' Trenton, sir." 

" ' Trantong ! Bien, Men ! Now I sail get some ting nice to eat. Ha, ha !' and rubbing his 
palms with delightful anticipation, he eagerly watched for the hotel from the window, as the stage 
rolled through the streets. 

" ' Ah, vat is he dat maison. Monsieur Tomkin "! (for Tom had given his fellow traveller his name.) 
I tink I know him.' 

" ' 'Tis Mr. Bispham's.' 

" ' Ah, Monsieur Bispham ! Now sal I get some ting nice to eat !' 

" As the stage drove up to the door, the travellers were welcomed by the courteous host. 

" ' Ah, ha. Monsieur Bispham !' cried the Fienchman, as the landlord stepped up to open the door 
of the coach. ' Je suis charme de vous voir! I 'ave com from Philadelfie ; my landladie giv me 
nossin but pork. Naw, sare, ven I vas here six veek ago, I got von veira nice dinnare — ah, mon 
dieu ! it vas too moche goode ! You givee me roastee bif, roastee shicken, inoidon — avery ting dat 
vas nice. Naw, Monsieur Bispham,' he continued, smiUng most insinuatingly in the landlord's face, 
and rubbing his palms together, ' vat 'ave you got for my dinnare ? I am almostee starve. Six 
veek my landladie giv me noting but de pork ; I com to Bristole, and Monsieur Bizanet giv me no- 
ting but de pork ; and I hate de pork as I do ze devvil. Naw, Monsieur Bispham, vat you giv uz 
for de dinnare V 

" There was a merry twinkle in Tom King's eye as he caught that of mine host which told vo- 
lumes, and which the other was not slow in taking. 

" ' I can give you some very fine spare-ribs,' replied Mr. Bispham, in his blandest manner. 

" ' Spare-iecb ! vat he is 1 Sparc- reeb ! I sposhe he verra goode !' he muttered half to himself, as 
he descended to the pavement. ' Now, jentilmen, you take de tendare-loing for youi share, I wilt 
tak de spare-reeb for minself !' and with a step made light with delight he skipped into the bar-room. 

" ' Vaitare !' 

" ' Sir.' 

" ' Glass biandy vater; it mak de appetite sharp for de spare-reeb ! Ah, Monsieur Bispham, you 
von verra nice jentilman. Spare-reeb ! eh, I vill now 'ave some ting goode to eat.' 

" With impatient gratification he watched the entrance of each dish, and then, with his fellow- 
passengers, seated himself at the table before a dish which mine host, with a peculiar smile lurking 
in the coiner of his eye, himself, placed there. 

" ' Eh, Monsieur Bispham, vere is de spare-reeb V 

" ' The dish immediately before your plate.' 

" ' C'esi Men! Je le vois! Ah, Monsieur Bispham, I likee you verra moshe for von jentilmans. 
I vill cot him maintenant^ 

" With these words of gratitude and hope on his lips. Monsieur buried his knife into the crisp 
meat before him, and the pleasant odor followed the knife as it was drawn forth, and ascended to his 
nose. With dilated eyes and nostrils, he hung suspended over the iinsavory dish an instant, his 
knife and fork elevated in either hand, looking as if the truth were too great for belief. Twice — 
thrice, he bent his head towards it, and each time snuffed and snorted not unlike the unclean ani- 
mal of his holy abhorrence. Conviction flashes upon him. Pale as a corpse, he drops the knife 
and fork, and pushes back from the table. ' 

" ' Monsieur Bispham !' in tones of pitiful distress, while his pathetic glances from the spare-rib 
to mine host, and fiom mine host to the spare-rib, nearly brought tears (from hardly suppressed 
laughter) into Tom King's eyes, and filled every bosom around with manly sympathy. ' Monsieur 
Bispham !' 

" ' Sir.' 

" ' 'Ave you no oter ting but dis dam hog V 

" ' No, sir ; but I will tell you what I can do for you,' said the feeling landlord ; ' I can give yon' — 

" ' Notin more, sare ; I vant notin ! Vaitare !' 

" ' Yes, sir.' 



THE FRENCH JEW. 217 

" ' Give me glass brandy vatcr, cracker, and som onion,' and with a sigh that seemed to come from 
a half-empty wind-bag, he proceeded to dine off the grateful comestibles he had named. 

" ' Ah, never mind it, sir ; don't be alarmed,' said Tom, after they had got into the stage, putting 
on a face of inimitable commiseration ; ' you'll make it all up when we get to Princeton.' 

" ' Piancetong ! dat is de place vere de collegshe ish. I see him dere. Ah, I stop at Monsieur 
Joline. I get someting verra goode to eat, Monsieur Joline ; he givee me roastee shickens, roastee 
sheep, nice fricasee de poulet, de pudding — de avery ting nice. Ah, Monsieur Tomkin, I sail get 
some ting verra goode. for to eat now, paibleu !' 

" When the coach came in sight of Princeton, out popped the Frenchman's head. 

" ' Drivare, vat place he is, eh V 

" ' Princeton, sir.' 

" ' Prancetong, ah ! Naw, jentilmen, ve sail 'ave someting goode to eat !' and his haggard fea- 
tures became luminous at the thought. 

" ' Ah, ah, Monsieur Joline,' he cried, as the coach drew up to the door of the hotel ; ' I am so re- 
joice to see you ! Sare, I 'ave com from Philadclfie ; my landladie giv me noting but de pork — six 
veek she giv me noting bat de pork. I almostee starve. I com to Bristole — Monsieur Bizanet giv 
me noting but de pork. I com to Trantong — Monsieur Bispham giv me noting but de poik. Naw, 
Monsieur Joline, my goode frien',' he added, stepping from the coach, and pathetically putting his 
hand on mine host's shoulder, while his voice was dropped to a low insinuating tone, 'will you givee 
me someting goode for my dinnare ]' 

" ' Oh yes, sir,' replied the landlord, who had caught a twinkle of Tom King's eye ; ' oh, yes; I 
can give you a tender-loin.' 

" ' Bah !' with supreme disgust. 

" ' I can give you a spare-rib, sir.' 

" ' Bah, bah ! 'ave you noting else V 

" ' Ah, yes ; I will let you have a very fine chop.' 

" ' Schop — schop ! I don' knaw vat he is. Monsieur Tomkin, vill you tellee me vat he is — de 
schopl' 

" ' It is my favorite dish, sir,' said Tom, licking his chops ; ' we are lucky in getting at Mr. Jo- 
line's to dine.' 

" * Ah-h-h ! Monsieur Tomkin,' he cried, shaking Tom by both hands, ' I vill den 'ave som ting 
goode to eat. I vill tak som de schop, Monsieur Joline. Jentilmen, you hear me ! you may tak de 
tendare-loing and de spare-rib for yourself — I vill 'ave de schop for my share. Ah, jentilmen, did I 
not tellee you I get someting goode to eat at Monsieur Joline 1 Vaitare, giv me glass brandy vater !' 

" With moist lips and longing eyes, did Monsieur survey the serving-up and entree of the various 
dishes, (if there can be variety where all the dishes are of like meat.) At length, came out ' mine 
host,' and announced dinner. The famished Frenchman glided in strait to one of the chairs, and 
was about to take it — 

" ' Pah ! spare-reeb !' 

" He darted to another — 

" ' Pah ! tendare-loing !' 

« ' Here, sir,' said Tom, pointing to the chair next to his, ' you will find this seat pleasanter — be- 
sides, here are the chops placed for you.' 

" ' Grace/ Bien, bien! You are tres polite, Monsieur Tomkin,' and sliding into the chair, he 
seized his knife and foik, and commenced upon the delicate dish prepared for him. No sooner, how- 
ever, did the porkerous odor that freely rose with the steam on being disturbed by the knife assail 
bis nostrils, and convince him that swine's flesh was set before him, than he sprung from the table 
as if the porker had come bodily to life in the dish. 

" ' Oh, mon dieu — mon dieu ! Monsieur Joline ! Comment V appelait-on? Qu'est ce que c^est 
diable de schop 1 Vat you call de schop, Monsieur 1' 

" ' Why, my dear sir,' replied mine host, with gravity, ' that, sir, is acknowledged on all hands to 
be one of the most delicious parts of the hog.' 

" ' Hog — cochon? Tonneur de dieii!^ and with a backward leap, Monsieur placed ten feet be- 
tween himself and the object of his abhorrence. ' Monsieur JoUne !' and he approached the land- 
lord with a tale of wo written in his sad visage, ' ah ! Monsieur Joline, I 'ave com from France. I 
'ave been Philadelfie six veek ; my landladie givee me noting but de pork — six veek she giv me 
noting but de pork. I com Bristole — Monsieur Bizanet givee me noting but de pork. I com Tran- 
tong — Monsieur Bispham givee me noting but de pork. I com Prancetong, and you givee me no- 
ting but de pork. I almostee starve.' Then placing his open palms over his collapsed stomach, and 
almost weeping his spirit from his eyes, he called in a tristful tone — 

"'Vaitare, givee me glass brandy vatei, som onion and cracker.' 

" ' Never mind, my dear friend,' said Tom King, with well-feigned sympathy, after they were 
once more in the coach ; ' never mind ; wait till you get to New Brunswick, and Mr. De Graw will 
give you a good dinner.' 

" ' Ah, ha ! I knaw Monsieur De Graw,' he said, brightening up, ' I knaw him verra well. He

giv me von verra nice dinnare — roastee bif, bif-stik, shicken, som pie, som nice pudding. Ah, jolie 
villa Newe Bronsvicke ! I get someting goode to eat. Monsieur De Graw. Drivare, how far he is 
Newe Bronsvicke V 
" ' Soon be there, sir.' 

" ' Eh, bien ! now you sail see, jentilmen — you sail see, Monsieur Tomkin, vat good dinnare I 
vill eat at Monsieur De Graw ! Oh, oh ! I knaw verra well Monsieur De Graw. You sail see naw 
vat you sail see.' 

" The symmetrical snow-white spire of the Episcopal church, and the old Spanish looking tower 
of the Dutch, at length rose above the distant fields, and caught the eye of the vigilant Frenchman. 
" ' Drivare, vat place he is coming, eh V 
" ' New Brunswick, sir.' 

" ' Newe Bronsvicke ! Bien ! Now you sail see. Monsieur Tomkin — now you sail see, jentil- 
men, vat I vill 'ave to eat. Ah, ha ! I sail 'ave de nice dinnare — de roastee bif, de bif-stik, de shick- 
en, de nice pudding, som pie — avery ting !' and in renewed pleasurable anticipation, Monsieur's hun- 
gry countenance was wreathed v^'ith ghastly smiles, and he seemed several times as if, in his joy, he 
was about to hug his fiiend, ' Monsieur Tomkin,' to his shrunken breast. 

" The stage rolled rapidly down Albany street, and drew up at a spacious hotel, at the entrance 
to the antiquated bridge that spans the beautiful Raritan. Out stepped Mr. De Graw, smiling wel- 
come to the goodly company of travellers. 

" ' Ah, ha, Monsieur De Giaw,' cried the Frenchman, taking off his cap, and thrusting his red 
bandanna pate out of the coach window; ' ah, ha. Monsieur De Graw, how you do '? I am so en- 
joyed to see you. I am com from Philadelfie — my landladie for six veek givee me noting but de 
pork. I almostee starve. I com Bristole — Monsieur Bizanet givee me noting but de pork. I com 
Trantong — Monsieur Bispham givee me noting but de pork. I com Prancetong — Monsieur Joline 
givee me noting but de pork, and I hate de pork, sare, as I do ze devvil. Ah, bon dieu ! I almostee 
starve. Naw, Monsieur De Graw,' he added, in an insinuating tone, and with a winning smile that 
would have melted the heart of a Robespierre, ' now, Monsieur De Graw, vat 'ave you got good for 
my dinnare?' 

" ' I have some very fine steaks.' 

" ' Siik ! stik ! ah, jentilmen,' he cried, delightedly, ' I tol you I get someting goode to eat Mon- 
sieur De Graw. Stik ! I remembare him- he verra nice ! Jentilmen, you may 'ave de tendare- 
loing, de spare-ieeb, de schop, and all de odt-r ting — I vill tak de stik for my share. Vaitare,' he 
cried, with additional animation, ' bring me glass brandy vater i' 

" The ' brandy vater' was brought and drank with great gusto, and then with a gleam of high sa- 
tisfaction on his features, he took his stand by the dining-room door, and watched the entrance of 
each savory dish with much curiosity. 
" ' Monsieur De Graw !' 
"'Sir.' 

" ' Vere is my stik V 

" ' It is coming, sir — here it is.' J 

" ' Ah, bien ! I see him,' and following the last platter in, he seated himself before it. A cloud of 
steam rose from the insertion of the ready knife, and the accursed flavor of pork ascended to his ol- 
f ictory organs. 

" ' Qu'est ce que c'est diable de stik, Monsieur De Graw 1 Mais dis done! Vat you call dis stik V 
" ' Why that, sir, is acknowledged to be one of ihe most delicious parts of the hog.' 
'= Down dropped the poor French Jew's knife and fork, and rising up, he thus addressed himself 
to &lt; mine host,' at first more in sorrow than in anger, though with the recital of his griefs his indig- 
nation rose — 

" ' I am com from Paris. I go Philadelfie — six veek my landladie givee me noting but de pork. 
I com Bristole — Monsieur Bizanet givee me noting but de pork. I com Trantong — ^fAonsieur Bis- 
pham givee me notiiig but de pork. I com Prancetong — Monsieur Joline givee me noting but de 
pork. I almostee starve, sare, and I nevare been so maltreat in my life. Yen I vas in my own coun- 
tree, nobod}'^ not nevare serve me so, and, sare, I tink it is blackguard manner, and no jentilman, 
Vaitare,' he cried, in a subdued tone of sorrow, not unmingled with offended dignity, turning from 
the landlord with supreme contempt, having expended upon him his short-lived wrath, his stomach, 
doubtless, being all too weak to hold much anger ; ' vaitare, you givee som cracker, vater, and som 
onion, if you pleas.' , 

" ' Ah, sir,' said Tom King, as they re-entered the coach, squeezing the Frenchman's attenuated 
fingers in his consoling grasp ; ' ah, my dear sir, let it not disturb you, lest you impair your appe- 
tite; for I assure you, sir, that you will find at Newark every thing to gratify it.' 

" ' Newarke ! Bien ! I remember him,' he cried, catching at the brittle straw of hope Tom had 
kindly thrown out. ' I 'ave stop in Newarke one time. I nevare got suche good dinnare as I got 
dere !' 

" ' They give very good dinners at Gifford's,' said Tom. 

" * Gifforde ! ah, I knaw him ; he is de landlord. Ah, I knaw Monsieur Gifford verra well. He 



• THE FRENCH JEW. 219 

givee me roastee torkey, roastee shickens, voodcock, bif-stik, som pie — ah, mon dieu ! avery ting dat 
vas nice he give me ! Ah, you sail see, Monsieur Tomkin, vat you sail see, ven I com Newarke.' 

" By and by, the spires of Newark rose in sight, above the green meadows and pleasant woods 
that surround it, and caught the quick eye of the Frenchman. 

" ' Drivarc, vat he is V he eagerly asked. 

" * Newark, sir.' 

" ' Newarke ! Eh, bien, bien ! now, jentilmen, you sail see !' and rejoicing in the good things in 
" store for him, he sung, whistled, and said something pleasant to each one of his fellow travellers. 
The coach at length stopped at the door of ' Gifford's,' and out came the portly landlord himself, to 
do honor to his newly-arrived guests. 

" ' Dat ish Monsieur Giiford, ish it not, Monsieur Tomkin V he asked, as he caught sight of him 
from a distance. 

" ' That is he, and he will give j ou a capital dinner,' replied Tom. 

" * Ah, Monsieur Gifford, how you do 1 It make me verra rejoice to see you. You look verra 
fat, Monsieur Gifford. Naw, Monsieur GiiFord, I 'ave com from Paris ; I com to New Yorrk, den 
I go Philadelfie. I stop wid you ven I go, six veek ago. Oh, de nice dinnare you giv me — roastee 
torkey, roastee shicken, voodcock, loastee bif, bif-stik, sora pie — avery ting dat vas goode you give 
me. Naw, I go Philadelfie — my landiadie givee me, for six veek, noting but de pork. I almostee 
starve. I com Bristole — Monsieur Bizanet givee me noting but de pork. I com Trantong — Mon- 
sieur Bispham givee me noting but de pork. I com Prancetong — Monsieur Joline givee me noting 
but de pork. I com Newe Bronsvicke — Monsieur De Graw givee me noting but de pork. I al- 
mostee starve. Naw, Monsieur Gifforde,' he added, with a pathetic look, working his features into 
a coaxing smile, 'naw. Monsieur Gifford, vat vill you givee me goode for my dinnare V 

" In the meanwhile, sundry signs and words had been interchanged between Tom King and 
'mine host,' and Mr. Gifford answered with ready civility. 

tt i Why, in the first place, sir, we have some very excellent tender-loin.' 

" ' Bah !' 

" ' We have a very fine spare-rib, sir.' 

" ' Bahr 

" ' We have some capital chops.' 

"'Bah!' 

" ' Well, sir, perhaps you would like a nice steak.' 

'^^ Bait, bah! noting but de hog. Monsieur Gifford! sare! ven I vas here last, you gives me 
avery ting — de roastee bif, de voodcock, de bif-stik, som pie. Now, Monsieur Gifford, 'ave you not 
got noting good"!' 

" ' Ah, sir, there is one thing I had forgotten — -we are going to have a fine roaster.' 

" ' R-roastare ! Ah, jentilmen, you hear ! r-r-roastare !' he cried, sounding the r like a watchman's 
rattle; and, turning to the company, he shook each one by the hand, while his hollow visage was 
illuminated with the reflection of his inward joy. ' I tol' you, jentilmen, we get someting to eat 
here ! Now, you tak de dam hog vid twentie name, I vill 'ave de roastare for my dinnare.' 

" Feeling now sure of a dinner, he became magnanimous, and after calling for ' brandy vater' in 
a more confident tone than he had hitherto used, he turned blandly to his fellow travellers — 

" ' Monsieur Tomkin — jentilmen — you tak someting 1 Monsieur Gifford, you tak glass brandy 
vater V 

" After drinking, he began to rub and expand his abdomen, and to swell out like the frog in the

A CHAPTER 



FIELD SPORTS and MANLY PASTIMES, 



BY AN EX PE RIENC E D PR A CTITIONE R. 



GYMNASTICS AND GYMNASIA. 

In our last number we gave, in brief, the History of Gymnastics and Gymnasia, and dwelt, at 
some length, upon their manifest advantages. Education, indeed, may be divided into two parts, 
physical and mental ; and of the former Gymnastic Exercises, are the most extensive, and, undoubt- 
edly, the earliest portion. Their purpose is, by systematic guidance, to strengthen the muscular 
system, and to teach the means of its most advantageous employment. Their general utihty will be 
questioned only by those who are not aware that the health and vigor of all the bodily orgaiis depend 
on the properly-proportioned exercise of each. Gymnastics insure, in particular, the full develop- 
ment of all the locomotive organs ; preventing or correcting all deformities to which these organs are 
liable. They are well calculated to produce strength and activity, and to bestow invariable health. 
They confer beauty of form ; they impart grace of action ; above all, they inspire confidence in 
difficult situations, and suggest resources in danger. 

The term " Gymnastics" in its widest sense, may be made to include a great variety of subjects 
such, for instance, as riding, rowing, and swimming — but, more strictly, is confined to those parti- 
cular feats which are practised in gymnasia, and which may be regarded as adapting the bodily 
system to any possible variety of exertion. In this view we now consider the term ; and may devote 
separate papers hereafter to the discussion of the other physical exercises above mentioned. 

GYMNASIUM 

was the name given, originally, by the Greeks to the place where public exercises were performed. 
We now apply the term in a similar sense. It is not enough to know the theory ; the practise must 
be combined with it ; and, man being a social animal, that practice is not to be attained in solitude. 
The Gymnast does not anive at his enviable pre-eminence by hearsay ; he does not bear about him 
that delightful sensation of capability to perform and endure what is out of the reach of ordinary men, 
and by a mere act of volition too, without first making repeated trials and efforts, and by witnessing 
in the Gymnasium the performances of others, thereby encouraging the pleasing hope that his exer- 
tions, also, will be crowned with success. 

GENERAL RULES TO BE ATTENDED TO BY TEACHERS OF GYM- 
NASTIC EXERCISES, 

1. The exercise of the pupils should always take place early in the morning, before breakfast, or 
two or three hours after a meal. 

2. Few persons in good health are ever injured by being overheated ; but from drinking when ex- 
cessively hot, or being cooled too quickly, practices highly pernicious ; therefore, take off such clothing 
as can be spared previous to commencing the exercise, and put them on again immediately after. 
Lying down upon the cold ground afterwards, is very dangerous. 

3. Commence with the more gentle exercise, not with its most violent degrees ; gradually leave off 
in the same manner. Too sudden transitions are dangerous. 



222 



BURTON S GENTLEMAN S MAGAZINE. 



4. Do not let your bodily exertion be carried to excess : your object should be to strengthen the 
body not to exhaust or render it languid. 

45. In all exercises attention should be paid to such a position of all the parts of the body, that none 
may be exposed to injury — the tongue must never be suffered to remain between the teeth, the legs 
must not be separated too far. 

6. It is necessary, and very advantageous, particularly where the pupils are numerous, to keep up 
a ceitain degree of Military regularity and obedience to command. 

7. Distinguish the feeble from the athletic, attempt not to make the weak hardy and strong at 
once, but take time, and proceed gradually. The best standard for the feeble at first is their own 
desire — their own inchnation. 

8. Observe what limbs of each Gymnast are the feeblest, and let these be particularly exercised. 
The left hand and arm are commonly weaker than the right ; let them be frequently exercised, there- 
fore, by lifting, carrying and supporting the weight of the body by suspension, till they become as 
strong as the others. 

9. The Gymnast must bear in mind, as much as possible, the degree attained by each of his pupils 
in every exercise, that he may not set them to any thing above their ability. This is an important 
rule for avoiding danger. 

PRELIMINARY EXERCISES. 

What may be termed the initiatory exercise is for the purpose of strengthening and rendering 
flexible all the different joints of the body. This is what persons unaccustomed to Gymnastics stand 
most in need of. The pupils are, usually, ranged in a line at such distances that each can barely 
touch the other's finger with his extended arm. They then practise after the example of their leader 
every different flexion of which the joints are capable viz : bending down on the toes till the knees 
neaily touch the ground, and rising therefrom slowly, without any assistance from the hands, hold- 
ing the arm at full length, and rapidly whirling it in a circle, darting the fists forward, and suddenly 
withdrawing them to the shoulder ; with various other motions which are deemed desirable. 

After training the body in this manner, the student will be enabled to sustain the fatigue of exer- 
cising on 

THE PARALLEL BARS. 




The pupil being placed between the two horizontal bars, 
which ate parallel to each other, by a strong pressure of his 
hands on both the bars he must raise his body, the arms being 
kept perfectly straight, and the legs close. In this position 
the body is vaulted over the bar to the right or left. The 
pupil is then directed to walk on his hands along the two 
bars, backwards and forwards, to pass with both his hands 
from one bar to another, his body being suspended the whole 
time. The exercise on the parallel bars improve the flexi- 
bility of the joints, strengthen the muscles, and must be used 
preparatory to the 



LEAPING BARS. 



This ranks among the most excellent of the gymnastic exercises, for it 
strengthens and gives elasticity to the feet, legs, knees, and thighs, and 
braces every muscle while its invigorates the courage. Two posts are per- 
pendicularly fixed in the ground, about seven feet asunder, and each of these 
posts is perforated with holes at small but regular intei-vals, for inserting 
an iron pin, on which is loosely hung a horizontal cord, the pin being 
placed at equal heights on the two opposite posts. A small bag, containing 
either a bit of lead or stone, at each end, tightens the cord. This may be 
practised either standing or running, and should the leaper miss the pro- 
posed height, the cord easily yields, and prevents any disagreeable accident. 
The leaper must be careful to raise his feet and knees in a straight dhection, 
neither separating the legs, nor inclining them to either side ; and in taking 
a running leap, the run must be a short, tripping step on the toes, gradual- 
ly quickened, as this does not exhaust the strength previous to the leap. 
The body must always be inclined forwards in rising, and the leaper must 

observe not to pitch wholly on his heels, but chiefly on the toes and balls of the feet. 

To acquire strength and pliability of body, courage and presence of mind, preservation of eqviili- 

brium and accuracy of eye, recourse must be had to 




GYMNASTICS AND GYMNASIA.

THE WOODEN HORSE. 

This is an oblong block of wood, rudely shaped like a 
horse's body, and covered on the top with a cushion of 
stuffed leather. The exercise consists in placing one or 
both hands on the block, and, in the leap, throwing one 
leg over it, and so bestriding it. Both legs and the body 
are, sometimes, thrown quite over it, which may be done 
either standing or with a run. Mr. Barrett has made some 
improvement in the shape of his wooden-horses, which 
differ considerably in appearance from the one in our en- 
graving. This is one of the best of the Gymnastic appa- 
ratus, and the exercise connected with it has a powerful 
tendency to strengthen the limbs. 

Numerous other exercises are practised — ^viz : that of 

DARTING THE JAVELIN. 

To practice this there is an abutment raised at one end of the Gymnasium, on which is placed a 
mark to aim at. The dait is a perfectly straight shaft, five or six feet long. The weight must be 
adapted to the strength of the thrower, the length to his height. It is grasped in the middle, and 
thrown with all the force of the arm to the appointed mark. 

LEAPING WITH A POLE, 

Over a given height, or a required distance. To effect this, the leaper grasps the pole with both his 
hands, the right hand at the top, the left at some little distance below it. The leaper takes a smart 
run, in proportion to the height ; places the lower pointed end of the pole just before his feet, neither 
to the right nor to the left ; gives a good spring, which he assists by raising himself with his hands, 
and swings himself round in a curved line to the point he aims at. An indifferent leaper cannot 
pass a bar higher than himself. In this exercise, in which the body is swung half round the pole, 
the leaper must not pitch in the direction in which he rose, but must turn himself round in leaping, 
so that when his feet come to the ground his face may look toward the place from which he took 
his rise. In consequence of this turning the feet strike the ground with much less violence. Be- 
ginners must commence with leaps of no great height, and be careful to pitch rather on the toes. 

EXERCISING ON THE BARS. 

Two horizontal bars are placed parallel to each other, and the pupil being placed betwixt, he is 
directed to raise his body, by a strong pressure of his hands on both the bars. The arms must be 
kept perfectly straight, and the legs close. In this position the body, after two or three vibrations, 
is vaulted with a bound over the bar to the right or left. In this, care must be taken to clear the 
bar, that the back may not touch it in coming down. The pupil is then directed to walk on his 
hands along the two bars, backwards and forwards, to pass with both his hands from one bar to 
another, his body being all the while pendulous, besides a variety of other evolutions. 

HAULING THE ROPE. 

Two parties of Gymnasts equal in number, and, as near as can be, equal in strength, are arranged 
on each side of a stout cable rope. When all is prepared, the director gives the word, each party 
endeavoring to draw the rope, with their opponents, along. Sometimes the strength of the parties 
seems so nearly balanced as to render the victory for some minutes doubtful. 

RUNNING. 

This consists simply in holding the hands firmly fixed to the haunches, keeping the mouth rather 
shut, and breathing mostly through the nostrils. The whole set off at a brisk trot, with the director 
at their head. 

EXERCISE OF THE HANDS, LEGS, AND ARMS, BY SUSPENSION. 

Two perpendicular posts are fixed in the ground, ten or twelve feet asunder, a cross horizontal 
beam is fixed at the top ; on this beam the pupils hang by their hands ; and even by their legs, some- 
times by the hands and legs, and practise a number of evolutions, making the joints flexible, and 
strengthening the muscles.

But not the least important portion of the exercises of the Gymnasium is that connected with 

CLIMBING AND MOUNTING. 

All Gymnasia are furnished with Climbing-Stands. These are constructed in various manners — 
but our engraving, perh-ips, represents the best kind in use. 




In describing the exercises connected with the Stand it is necessary that we should frequently re- 
fer to this cut. To the crossbeam are attached the implements for climbing, namely, two poles, a 
Tope ladder, and three ropes. The two standing places are intended for the exercises in mounting; 
a ladder leads to the lower one and is made fast to the mast, and another leads from the lower to the 
upper platform, which latter is principally intended for the purpose of accustoming the learners to 
look down from any height. Before the learner can go through the exercises on the Climbing-Stand, 
he must have practised some exercises for augmenting the muscular powers of the body and limbs, 
such as climbing, hanging by the arms, etc. When expert in these exercises the learners may com- 
mence the following ones : — 

1. Beginners ascend and descend the ladder which is fixed to the Chmbing-Stand, in the custom- 
ary way, until they acquire expertness and courage. 

2. They descend with the back turned towards the ladder. 

3. They mount and descend in the usual way, but only with one hand ; and, after a little practice 
carry something in the other. See the uppermost figure on the sloping ladder. 

4. The learner goes up and down without using his hands. See the lowermost figure on the 
sloping ladder. The ascent is extremely easy ; after which he uses his hands in turning round so 



GYMNASTICS AND GYMNASIA. 225 

as to have his back towards the ladder when descending. In this part of the exercise, the teacher 
must always be ready to assist h'm. 

5. Two learners meet upon the ladder and wish to pass each other. They either both remain on 
the front part of the ladder, and give way to each other as much as possible, or if one of them is- 
sufficiently expert in the two following exercises, he swings himself round to the back part, ifi order 
to let his companion pass. 

6. The exeicises now commence on the back part of the ladder. The learner easily ascends from 
step to step by advancing his hands and feet, at the same time, higher and higher. 

7. The learner mounts along the front part of the ladder as usual; then swings himself round to 
the back part, along which be descends. 

8. The learner mounts and descends the ladder upon its back pait, without making use of his teet. 
See the middle figure on the sloping ladder. This may be divided into two parts. The first consists 
in taking fast hold of the most convenient rundle with both hands, and raising the body forcibly up- 
ward. At this moment, one hand seizes the next highest rundle, and immediately afterwards, the- 
other hand does the same. Both hands again raise the body as before, etc. In the second part of 
this exercise, the hands seize the rundles singly and alternately ; which is much more difficult, and 
only accomplished by practised learners. 

9. Climbing either the upright or slant ]j ok. — The thickness of the upright pole to the right of 
the engraving is from two to two inches and a half, or more, according to the size of the learners. It 
must be perfectly smooth, and void of splinters. Its uppei end is fastened by an iion ring to the 
beam. The slant pole to the left must be at least three inches thick. Neither of them is made very 
fast in the ground, but only sunk a little into it, in order that they may be easily replaced by poles 
of different sizes. The position of the climber is the same in both the upright and oblique pole, an3 
is shown upon the latter. Nothing must touch the pole besides the feet, legs, knees, and hands. 
The climber, while he raises himself with both hands, draws his legs up the pole, then holds fast ftj 
them, and again places his hands higher up. He continues this alternate use of the legs and arms 
until he has reached the top. The descent is not at all difficult ; it is not performed similar to ihe 
ascent, but merely by sliding quickly down with the legs, scarcely ever touching the pole at all 
with the hands, as shown in the upper figure on the upright pole. This exercise is more oifKcuIt 
upon the oblique pole, since the hands are more affected by the weight of the body. The learners: 
should be made very p^rfxt in this exercise, for eveiy one ought at least to be sufficiently expert, t&amp; 
slide himself down along a smooth pole placed against the window of a second or third story, 

10. Climbmg the mast is more difficult than the last exercise, for even when made of a moderate- 
size, it cannot be spanned round by the hands. It is fixed quite firm in the ground ; is from six fo- 
eight inches thick at the bottom, and thirty feet high. The learners must not be allowed to climb 
the mast until they are very expert at climbing the poles mentioned in the last exercise, and are abfe 
to get from that, upon the beam. All climbing succeeds best in hot weather, but more particularly 
that of the mast. The position of the legs is the same as wiih the pole ; boots are the best covering: 
for the feet. Since the mast is too thick to be grasped by the hands, the climber must lay fast hold 
of his left arm with his right hand, and vies versa. Learners climb with much more ease and se- 
curity, with naked arms, for the skin does not slip near so easily as the clothes. A climber up th. 
mast adheres to it with his whole body, as in the lower figure on the upright pole to the right, ue; 
he reaches the thinner part of it, as appears from the figure at the top of it. 

11. CUmhing the rope ladder. — The rope ladder should have three or four wooden rundles t 
spread it out, and ought to be made so as not to twist round and entangle when used ; if it has this 
fault, it is unserviceable. 

It is much more difficult to mount the rope ladder than the pole, the former hanging quite ioosey 
and not at all fastened at the bottom. The muscles of the arms and hands are very much afiecCed; 
for the latter must, when the learner is not sufficiently acquainted with this exercise, almost entirely 
support the body, which continually inclines backward. The manner of proceeding in this exercise 
is easy, for it is similar to ascending a wooden ladder; but as the rope ladder hangs perpendicularly ,, 
and is very flexible, the steps upon which the feet test, are generally pushed forward by the on- 
practised, and the upper part of the body sinks out of the perpendicular position into a very obliqae 
one ; whereby the whole weight of the body becomes supported by the hands, and the exercise is 
rendered so difficult that the learner cannot ascend very high. To obviate this, he must always ha^e 
a fast hold of the two main ropes, as shown in the lope ladder, and keep the bod}^ as much as jkjs- 
sible, stretched out upon the ladder and upright. If the ladder is sufficiently strong, the teacher allows 
two or three of his pupils to get up and down at the same time ; by which means they learn to pass 
each other. One hangs by a main rope until the other has passed him. 

12. CUmhing either tlie oblique or level rope. — Let a rope be fastened from one post io another^ 
or from the beam to an adjoining post, and in an oblique direction. The learner fixes himself to tlie 
rope as exhibited on the sloping rope, with the feet close to each other across it, and advances along- 
the rope by moving his hands one before the other, and either sliling his feet or moving them al- 
ternately like the hands. In this manner a number of soldiers might cross a small river, with tiseir 
arms and knapsacks when other means failed. 



226 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

There aie two ways of using the legs hi this exercise ; 1 st, so that the feet, either in ascending or 
descending, move forward along the lope alternately ; or one leg only may hang over the lope, and 
be made to slide along it ; but in both cases the pressure is painful, particularly if the climber does 
not wear boots. The 2nd, which is the best method, is to place the sole of one foot, for instance, 
the right, flat upon the rope, and to lay the left leg across the instep of that foot ; whereby the fric- 
tion of the rope is removed. 

13. CUmhing the vpright rope. — This exercise may be done in two different ways. It is very 
easy to those who are already expert at climbing the upright pole. The only difficulty lies in seizing 
the rope with the feet so as to obtain a firm support. 

In the first method the knees and thighs have nothing to do ; only the feet are employed. If the 
learner sit upon a chair, and cross his feet in the usual way, he will immediately perceive their proper 
position. The rope passes between them, and is held fast by pressing them moderately together, 
■while the hands alternately grasp higher up the rope. Hereupon the climber, hanging by his hands, 
also draws his feet higher up, fixes them again to the rope, and proceeds as before. 

In the second method, peculiar to sailors, the rope passes down from the hands of the climber, 
along one, generally the right thigh, not far above the knee ; winds round the inner side of this 
thigh, along the knee-hollow and the calf, and then across the insiep of the right foot, v.'hence it 
hangs loose. If the climber only treads moderately upon that part of the rope where it crosses the 
other foot, he will, by means of the varied pressure, obtain a firm support. The exercise depends 
almost entirely vipon holding the right leg and foot so that the rope may retain its proper winding, 
after being quitted by the left foot, when the hands have been raised for the purpose of drawing the 
body higher. This is easily acquired after a few trials. In descending, the hands must be lowered 
alternately, as they are raised in ascending, for if the hands slide down quickly, they will be injured. 

14. Resting upon the upright rope. — This exercise not only excites a lengthened power of the 
muscles, but also tends to promote expertness in dangerous situations. The climber mounts to a 
moderate height, and then halts ; swings the right foot three or four times round the rope, so that 
this winds roung the leg ; he then entwines it, by means of the left foot, once or twice round the 
light one, which he bends so as to point the toes upwards, and now treads the left foot firmly upon 
this last winding. The pressure which thus arises between the rope and the feet, opposes the whole 
■weight of the body. In this position he can rest a long time ; but suppose he wishes to be still more 
at his ease. With this intention he lowers his hands a little along the rope, then holds fast with the 
right hand, stoops, and grasps with the left that part of the rope which hangs below the feet. He 
raises himself again, and entwines this part a few times round his shoulders, hips, and the rope itself, 
until he is firmly entangled. 

Climbing by means of the arms only is one of the best exercises for strengthening all the muscles 
of the chest, the arms, and hands ; it is a true criterion by which to judge the powers of those mem- 
bers, and it also augments them most effectually. We seldom find a boy who is able in his eighth 
or ninth year to raise himself a little way either up the rope or pole by his hands only. The age of 
fourteen is generally the time when the arms become sufficiently strong ; therefore some attention 
must be paid to this point. 

15. Climbing up the pole by the hands only is perhaps easier than up the ladder, for with tliis 
the body hangs quite free, but with the former one side of the body is close to the pole, which facili- 
tates the learner a little. See the lower figure on the upright pole to the left. The feet hang loosely 
and remain perfectly steady. The climber must not be allowed to bend his knees, nor to stamp, as 
it were, in the air, nor to let the pole come between his thighs. There are two methods of employ- 
ing the hands in this exercise. According to the Jirst, which is the usual mode, both hands raise 
the body simultaneously ; immediately after which, one quickly grasps the pole higher up, while the 
other supports the weight alone for a moment. The second, in which each hand alternately supports 
the body alone, and the other, quite free, seizes the pole higher up, in order to raise the body again, 
lequires great practice and considerable strength in the arms. 

16. Climbing the rope by the hands only should be first practised upon the slant rope, as with it, 
the continual grasping higher up is much easier. The position of the hands and of the body similar 
to that required in climbing the pole. 

It should be observed that of the preceding exercises, all those which require more strength than 
agility must not be kept up too long. Strength increases gradually, its growth is not onlj' combined 
with exercise, but also with the development of the corporeal system. For this reason, such exer- 
cises should be frequent but not long. 

Exercises in mounting require neither particular strength nor agility ; they are intended to produce 
fearlessness, and the power of looking down from high stations, and consequently to prevent weak- 
ness of nerves and giddiness. 

The excellent Gymnasium of Mr. Barret, (in Walnut street) an engraving of which we gave in 
our last number, embraces many improvements upon the estabUshed system of Gymnastics — and a 
great variety of exercises are there practised, of which our limits have prevented us from taking 
notice. 



REVIEIV OF NEW BOOKS 



Hyperion, a Romance. By tlic autJior of Outre-Mer. Tv)o volumes. Samuel Colman, New York. 

Were it possible to thiow into a bag the lofty thought and manner of the " Pilgrims of the Rhine," 
together with the quirks and quibbles and true humor of " Tristram Shandy," not forgetting a few 
of the heartier drolleries of Rabelais, and one oi two of the Phantasy Pieces of the Lorrainean Cal- 
lot, the whole, when well shaken up, and thrown out, would be a very toleiable imitation of " Hy- 
perion." This may appear to be commendation, but we do not intend it as such. Works like this 
of Professor Longfellow, are the triumphs of Tom O'Bcdlam, and the grief of all true criticism. 
They are potent in unsettling the popular faith in Art — a faith which, at no day more than the pre- 
sent, needed the support of men of letters. That such things succeed at all, is attributable to the 
sad fact that there exist men of genius who, now and then, unmindful of duty, indite them — that 
men of genius ever indite them is attributable to the fact that these are often the most indolent of 
human beings. A man of true talent who would demur at the great labor requisite for the stern de- 
mands of high art — at the uniemitting toil and patient elaboration which, when soul-guided, result 
in the beauty of Unitj^, Totality, and Truth — men, we say, who would demur at such labor, make 
no scruple of scattering at random a profusion of rich thought in the pages of such farragos as " Hy- 
perion." Here, indeed, there is little trouble — but even that little is most unprofitably lost. To the 
writers of these things we say — all Ethics lie, and all History lies, or the world shall forget ye and 
your works. We have no design of commenting, at any length, upon what Professor Longfellow 
has written. We are indignant that he too has been recreant to the good cause. We, therefore, 
dismiss his " Hyperion" in brief. We grant him liigh qualities, but deny him the Future. In the 
present instance, without design, without shape, without beginning, middle, oi end, what earthly

with the Pawnee Tribe of Indians, in the remote prairies of the Missouri, and a visit to Cuba 
and the Azore Islands. By the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray. Tiuo Volumes. Harper and 
Brothers, New York. 

Reasons of a nature altogether domestic induced Mr. Murray to delay, until the present moment, 
the publication of his travelling journal, and, in some respects, this delay has been of advantage to 
himself and to the public. A thorough disgust with the twaddle of the Trollopes, and the flat false- 
hoods and miserable inanities of the Marryatts, has thrown him, by means of a proper caution, upon 
the better, although less beaten track, of candor, plain statements, and common sense. He has also 
now in his favor that public revulsion of feeling which these little scribbling wretches have brought 
about. We turn from folly with more sincere pleasure than we should have turned from good 
sense, to the candid, frank, and simply philosophical narrative of the gentleman in mind and man- 
ner — the gentleman whose station in society, as well as whose endowments through education, enti- 
tle him to our respect, and ensure for him our most earnest attention. 

We do not mean to say, however, that our author has been brow-beaten into truth by the popular 
judgment upon falsehood. On the contrary, no one can look over the volumes before us without 
feeling at once aware that a direct and open simpUcity is the leading feature of the mind of the wri- 
ter. His speculations, never showily profound, are only so at all, by their thorough and unpretend- 
ing naturalness, by the obviousness and simplicity with which they seem to be educed from the ob- 
jects which have presented themselves to his understanding. For this reason, the plain narrative 
of his sea-disasters, in the beginning of his voyage, will rank with any composition within our 
knowledge, upon a similar subject. His observations strike the reader with all the vividness of ori- 
ginality, because, being absolutely such as natural thoughts suggest, they differ altogether from the 
e/a6ora/ec? reflections to which the romanticists have accustomed the popular mind. 

His work is already in the hands of all classes of readers, and no comments now to be made upon 
it will have much influence upon the general decision. In common with all the world, we regard it 



228 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

as positively the most entertaining book of travels in America put forth by a British writer. It 
abounds in naive remarks, and shows a happy tact in the choice of subjects for disquisition. The 
chapters respecting his visit to the Pawnee Nation have about them a spice of open-hearted drollery 
and thorough good-humor, which will render them exceedingly popular. The " Pawnee dandy," 
we perceive, has been frequently copied into the daily prints, and it is indeed a laughable portrait- 
ure worthy of all praise. 

In his delineations of Virginian habitudes and manners — a theme often attempted, but seldom 
with success — he has been particularly truthful. Virginians will recognize his sketchy picture as far 
more life-like than many an elaborate painting. We may here observe, by the way, that in his de- 
sire to do justice to the noble and lofty simplicity of Judge Marshall, he has been led into one little 
inaccuracy. " His house is small," he writes, " and more humble in appearance than those of the 
average of successful lawyers, or merchants." This is true, if at all, only as regards the average 
throughout the Union. In Richmond, Judge Marshall's is regarded as a very large and desirable 
house — indeed, it would be called a large house any where. In regard to Mr. Murray's "receiving 
attentions in Richmond more marked than he either expected or felt himself entitled to," We can as- 
sure him that he is precisely the kind of person whom Virginians make a point of treating with re- 
spect, and that throughout the whole State he could have entered at will into a society as absolutely 
aristocratical as any in Europe — a society, by the way, which would have either received the redoubt- 
able Captain Marryatt as a monster to be tolerated, »r kicked him out of doois as a matter of course. 



T%e Poems of Ossian. Translated by James McPkerson, Esq. To which are prefixed a Life of 
the Translator; A Preliminary Discourse or Review of the Controversy relative to the Authen- 
ticity of the Poems, n?id Dissertations on the Era and Poems of Ossian, Thomas, Cowperth- 
luait 4" Cv., Philadelphia. 

This edition of the " much debated" Ossian is a very beautiful one indeed. Of the Poems them- 
selves it is scarcely necessary to speak. To-day, thanks to a thousand critical investigations, their 
great merits, as well as minor deficiencies, are matters sufliciently well understood. We think it 
desirable that the name of the writer should have been prefixed, in each case, to the Dissertations on 
the Era and Poems, as well as to the Life of McPherson. It must, indeed, have been omitted by 
an oversight. The Dissertations, we presume, are those of Dr. Blair — but there is nothing in the 
book to lead the reader to this opinion. Moreover, these treatises are all in favor of the authenticity 
of the Poems; it might have been as well, perhaps, to olfer something on the other side of the ques- 
tion-^especially as that other side is altogether the most tenable. Dr. Johnson's protest might have 
been well given ; it is much to the purpose, and his hearty exacerbation is amusing, to say no more. 
The Objections of Malcolm Laing would have qlso proved interesting ; or those of Wordsworth in 
the preface to an edition of his own poems; and the important observations of Gibbon should have 
been, at least, alluded to, in an edition like the present — observations which, with ourselves individu- 
ally, had more force in engendering a conviction of the forgery than the more elaborate arguments 
x)f more verbose men. 



The Gift. A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1840. Edited by Miss Leslie. Carep and 

Hart, Philadelphia. 

This, the fourth volume of the " Gift," is, in all respects, superior to its predecessors, and is a re- 
markably beautiful and excellent book. The plates, with a single exception, are engraved by Ame- 
rican engravers, from original pictures by American painters. Indeed, most of these pictures may 
be said to have been painted expressly for the work, as they form a portion of the private collection 
of Mr. Carev. In thus looking at home for talent, the publishers have shown a patriotic and praise- 
worthy spirit which is not often evinced in cases such as this, where the patriotism is at the expense 
of the pocket. 

In our present number, we have no r^oom to speak at length of the book, as it deserves; we may 
take an opportunity of doing so hereafter. At present we may remark, in brief, that the "Don 
Quixotte," painted by Leslie, and engraved by Danforth, is noble and bold ; that the " Ghost-Book," 
by Pease, from a picture by Conregys, is, in the same manner, capital ; as also, again in the same 
manner, the " Isabella'' of Sully, engraved by Cheney. The plate entitled " Childhood," by the 
same artists, (Sully and Cheney,) is a gem ; and we particularly admire " A Portrait," beautifully 
done by Forrest, from a design, also, of Sully's. The embellishments, however, which will attract 
the most attention, are two vivid home pictures by W. E. Mount, engraved with great spirit by A. 
Lawson. 

Of the literary contents, we can now scarcely say a word. Mr. Simms has a good story abou6 a 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 229 

"Lazy Crow;" Miss Leslie has an admirable sketch in her own alwavs admirable manner; and a 
brief poem, by N. C. Brooks, of Baltimore, entitled " The Nyctanthes," is worthy of the highest 
commendation. 



A System of Modern Geography, comprising a Description of the Present State of the World, 
and its Five Great Divisions, America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceanica, with their Several 
Empires, Kingdoms, States, Territories, etc. The luhole Embellished by Numerous Engravings 
of Various Interesting Objects of Nature and Art,- together with Eepresentations of Remarka- 
ble and Noted Events. Simplified and Adapted to the Capacity of Youth. Illustrated by an 
Atlas of Sixteen Maps, Drawn and Engraved to Accompany the Work. By S. Augustus Mit- 
chell. Tho?nas, Couperthwait cV Co., Philadelphia. 

Mr, Mitchell is very favorably known to the public by previous geographical labors. His present 
work does him infinite credit, and, owing to the obvious character of its superiority over all school- 
books upon the same subject, will not fail to make his fortune, by making its way, at once, into every 
respectable school in the Union. In such matters, teachers, who deserve the name, have no alterna- 
tive — it is positively incumbent upon them to supply their pupils with the best (accessible) text- 
books in every department of knowledge. Apart from the positive merit of a work they are allow- 
ed, in honor, no consideration. In this view of the case we predict a rapid and extensive circulation 
of the Geography now before. us. It is, beyond all question, the best school-book upon the subject 
now in existence. 

We note a few of its leading features. The whole work is divided into short sections, such as 
are considered sufficient for one lesson, and these sections are marked, for the purpose of saving trou- 
ble to the teacher, and gradually enlarged, so as to keep pace with the increasing capacity of the 
pupil. 

As far as prescribed limits would permit, we have a description of the various political divisions 
of the earth, according to the views exhibited in the latest and most authentic works on the subject. 
In the accomplishment of this portion of his design, Mr. Mitchell has evidently labored with dili- 
gence, and assuredly has displayed a more than ordinary tact. 

The text of tlie book is remarkably accurate, not only in itself, but in its accordance with the At- 
las — a point not always attended to. The Maps themselves are all fiom original drawings, especi- 
ally adapted to the work, and are engraved with exceeding neatness and distinctness, as well as care- 
fully colored. They also embody the location of remarkable historical events, of rail-roads and ca- 
nals, and the distances from continent to continent — a decided and valuable improvement. We 
have maps, too, of Palestine and Liberia. The map of Oceanica is compiled with reference to the 
religious and moral changes which have occurred in its principal islands within the last twenty years. 
This has never been done before. 

We should not neglect to speak of the pictorial designs which enliven and illustrate the book, and 
are all well engraved, chiefly from spirited original drawings. Some of these designs are of a na- 
tional character, illustrating important incidents in the history of the country ; the greater number, 
however, represent striking objects in nature or art, and are of a character well adapted to arrest the 
attention and excite the curiosity of the pupil. 

The scrupulous accuracy of the text, (as far as positive accuracy is attainable in a science so con- 
stantly progressive,) and the perfect distinctness of the maps, are points which, alone, would insure 
for Mr. Mitchell's Geography a preference over all the similar books with which the country is flood- 
ed, and in most of which the grossest and silliest errors abound, while their Atlases are scarcely to 
be understood at all — but there are a gieat variety of other particulars (a far greater variety than we 
can attempt to discuss here) which render the work, as we have already said, the most desirable text- 
book extant upon the subject of which it treats. We heartily wish it all the success which its very 
high merits deserve. 



Flora's Lexicon. An Inferprefation of the Language and Sentiment of Flovjers,- with an Out- 
line of Botany, and a Poetical Introduction. By Catharine H. Waterman. Herman Hooker, 
Philadelphia. 

This little work will hold a high place, and deservedly so, among the numerous gift-books for 1840. 
It IS aa attempt to comprise within reasonable compass a full lexicon of the rich language of flowers, 
and the work is adorned with such quotations from the best poets of our language, both native and 
foreign, as have a direct and graceful reference either to the peculiarities of the flowers, or to the sen- 
tirnents which they are imagined to express. An outline of Botany is appended — concise yet suf- 
ficient for its piirpose. The botanical name of each flower commences with a fanciful ornamental

wood-cut by way of capital letter, and we have also illustrations of the Rose, Ivy, Myrtle, Scarlet 
Ipomoea, Laurustinus, Convolvulus, Jasmine, Strawberry, Tulip, Crown Imperial, Turk's Cap, Lily, 
and Lily of the Valley, all beautifully drawn on stone, and colored by James Ackerinan. These, 
we say, are worthy of all praise ; but the gem of the work — and what would be a gem in any work — 
is the Poetical Introduction, from the pen of the editress, Miss Waterman. 



Opinions of Lord Brougliam on Politics, Theology, Law, Science, Education, Literature, etc. etc. 
As Exhibited in his Parliamentary and Legal Speeches, and Miscellaneous Writings. Two vo- 
lames. Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

The object of this publication was not only to embody the most brilliant passages from the most 
celebrated speeches and writings of Lord Brougham, but also to develop, iir a gradual manner, the 
particular mind and genius of the man. This design is well carried out, and we arise from the 
earnest perusal of the book with our opinion strengthened, if possible, in regard to the extraordinary 
character and exceeding vigor of the intellect discussed. Perhaps, however, the best portion of the 
work is embodied in the Prefatory Memoir, which contains more complete, accurate, and satisfactory 
information about his Lordship, both in Iris public and private life, than any thing of the kind hither- 
to published. 



Fair Rosamond,- or. The Days of King Harry II. An Historical Romance. By Thomas Mil- 
ler, Author of " Royston Gower," " Beauties of the Country," " A Day in the Woods," etc. 
Two volumes. Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

" Royston Gower" will even yet be fresh in the memory of many of our readers. Its writer ap- 
pears to us to be a man of true genius, but of a somewhat uncultivated intellect — of deficient edu- 
cation. 

The subject he has chosen for the present novel is one of excellent materiel, and he has handled 
it well. The liberties taken with the historical character of Rosamond, in making her privately mar- 
ried to the King, and in many other respects, are fully justifiable upon the ground that we really 
know little about her, and that that little has no great weight of authenticity. 



The Man About Town. By Cornelius Webbe, Author of " Glances at Life," etc. Two volumes. 

Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

Cornelius Webbe is one of the best of that numerous school of writers who sprang up upon the 
ruins of Lamb's intellect. He carries his harum-scarum, hyper-excursive mannerism to an extent 
which is sometimes fatigumg, but, upon the whole, is an author of merit, and possesses a dash of 
the " true and blissful Hippocrene." If a man is in a perfectly good humor with himself and all 
the world, he will find nothing to ruffle his temper in the " Man About Town." Some of these va- 
garies are capital, outrageously so, and all are very readable. " Punning made Easy," we reckon in 
the class outrageous. " Charley Stump, the Crossing Sweeper," is a humorous sketch, and the 
^' Young Man at Ninety," will be sure to please every one who is at the trouble of reading it. 



Hamilton King, or The Smuggler and the Dwarf. By the Old Sailor, authw of" Tough Yarns," 
" Stories of Greemuich Hospital," etc. Two volumes. Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

The Old Sailor, whoever he is, is also the author of " The Naval Foundling," a sea-novel, in 
three volumes, republished, a short while ago, by Messieurs Lea and Blanchard. He is a writer of 
spirit in many respects. His sea-scenes are exceedingly vivid and life-like, and altogether his works 
are of that particular character which is sure to render a book popular, in the most usual, and in the 
most rigorous sense of the term.

THE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON 

Illustrated by a Splendid Engraving on Steel. 



This building was commenced in 1793 by Mr. Hallet as architect, who was succeeded by Mr. G. 
Hadfield and Mr. Hoban, who finished the north wing. The charge of the work was then given to 
Mr. Jlenry B. Latrobe, (architect) who directed the building of the south wing, and prepared the 
halls for the reception of Congress. Such portions of the building having been completed as were 
indispensably necessary for public use, farther proceedings were suspended during the embargo, 
non-intercourse, and war ; at which time the interior of both wings was destroyed, in an incursion 
of the enemy. After the close of the war. Congress assembled, for several sessions, in a building 
patriotically raised by the citizens of Washington, for their accommodation. In 1815, Government 
determined to restore the Capitol. The work was commenced under B. H. Latrobe, who superin- 
tended it until December, 1817, when upon his resigning his charge, the farther proceedings were 
entrusted to C. Bulfinch, who proceeded to execute the designs already adopted for the Representa- 
tives' Hall and Senate Chamber, and to lay the foundation of the centre, comprising the Rotundo^ 
Library, etc. These have been completed, with the accompanying terraces, gate-ways, lodges, etc, 
in the course of ten years. The building now exhibits an harmonious whole, imposing for its mass 
and commanding situation, and well adapted for the important uses for which it is intended. It may 
be described as follows : — 

The Capitol of the United States is situated on an area enclosed by an iron railing, and including 
twenty-two and one half acres — the building stands on the western portion of this pl-it, and commands, 
by the sudden declivity of the ground, a beautiful and extensive view of the city, of the surrounding 
heights of Georgetown, etc. and of the windings of the Potomac as far as Alexandria. 

The exterior exhibits a rusticated basement, of the height of the first story ; the two others stories 
are comprised in a Corinthian elevation of pilasters and columns — the columns thirty feet in height, 
form a noble advancing portico, on the east, one hundred and sixty feet in extent — the centre of 
■which is crowned with a pediment of eighty feet span: a receding loggia of one hundred feet extent, 
distinguishes the centre of the west front. 

The building is surrounded by a balustrade of stone and covered with a lofty dome in the centre;, 
and a flat dome on each wing.

The Representatives' room is in the second story of the south wing — is semicircular, in the form 
of the ancient Grecian theatre — the chord of the longest dimension is ninety-six feet — the height, to 
the highest point of the domical ceihng is sixty feet. This room is surrounded by twenty-four 
columns of variegated native marble, or breccia, fiom the banks of the Potomac, with capitals of 
■white Italian marble, carved after a specimen of the Corinthian order, still lemaining among the 
ruins of Athens ; which stand on a base of freestone, and support a magnificent dome painted in a 
very rich and splendid style, to represent that of the Pantheon of Rome, and executed by an interest- 
ing young Italian artist, named Bonani, who died about twelve years ago. In the centie of this dome 
is erected, to admit the light from above, a handsome cupola, from which is suspended a massy 
bronze gilt chandelier, of immense weight, which reaches within ten feet of the floor of the chamber. 
The speaker's chair is elevated and canopied, and on a level vi-ith the loggia or promenade for the 
miembers, consisting of columns and pilasters of marble and stone. Above this, and under a sweep- 
ing arch near the dome, is placed the model of a colossal figure of Liberty^ by Caucici, (in plaster,) 
on the entablature beneath is sculptured an American Eagle, (in stone) just ready to fly ; copied 
from nature by an Italian sculptor of high reputation who has left but this single specimen of his 
talents in this countr}-. 

The artist, Segnior Valaperti, was but a short time in America, the most of which he spent in 
Washington. He was retiring in his habits, and of a melancholy temperament, associating with 
few persons, and with those but seldom. Soon after the completion of this chef d'' ceuvre he disap- 
peared, in a mysterious manner, and has never been heard of since. About a month after his dis- 
appearance a bodj' was found in the Potomac, which was thought from certain resemblances, to be 
his, (though this was never satisfactorily ascertained,) and hence it has been conjectured that in a 
fit of melancholy, he threw himself into the river, and thus put an end to his unhappy life. Such 
has often been the melancholy fate of genius. 

In front of the chair, and immediately over the entrance, stands a beautiful statue in marble re- 
presenting History, recording the events of the nation. She is placed on a winged car, which is in 
the act of rolling over the globe, on which is figured, in basso relievo, the signs of the Zodiac, and 
the wheel of the car is the face of the clock of the hall, finely designed and beautifully executed. 
The whole was done by Signior Franzoni, another meritorious Italian artist, who also died in this 
city. Between the columns is suspended fiiiiged drapery of crimsoned marines, festooned near the 
gallery, to limit the sound and assist the hearing. A magnificeirt portrait of Lafayette, at full length, 
painted by a French artist, and a most admirable likeness of that patriot, decorates a panel on one 
side the loggia, and indicated to the legislative body to whom it has been presented, that the corres- 
ponding panel on the opposite side could not be more appropriately filled than by the portiait of /ijni. 
who achieved the liberties and secured the independence of his country. Between the columns, at 
their base, are placed sofas for the accommodation of those who are privileged to enter the hall, and 
within the bar, in a semi-circle fronting the speaker's chair, are seated the members of the house, 
each of whom is furnished with a mahogany desk, armed chair and writing materials. 

The Senate Chamber in the north v.ing Ls of the same semi-circular form — seventy-five feet in 



THE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON. 233 

its greatest length and forty-five high — a screen of Ion'' imns, with capitals, after those of the 
temple of Minerva Polias, support a gallery to the east, and form a loggia below — and a new gallery 
•of iron pillars and railings of a light and elegant structure, projects from the circular walls — the dome 
ceiling is enriched with square caissons of Stucco. 

The walls are covered with straw colored drapery, between small pilasters of marble in the wall. 
Columns oi breccia or Potomac marble, support the eastern gallery. 

The upper gallery on the east side was removed in 1828, and a light, airy, and beautiful one as 
mentioned above, erected along the semicircle fronting the President's chair, supported on small iron 
columns, handsomely bronzed, with a railing in front, of the same material and color. The removal 
of the dark and heavy mass of stone which formed the upper gallery has thrown into the chamber a 
proper degree of light, which it wanted before ; and the new and tasteful gallery renders it more con- 
venient to the members, by accommodating those who would otherwise be on the floor. The access, 
to it, however, is somewhat objectionable, as are most of the stair-cases in the building. They are 
rather confined and dark, for so spacious and magnificent an edifice as the Capitol. A stair-case is 
susceptible of great architectural beauty ; and in the construction of such a building the opportunity 
to display that beauty should not have been neglected. 

The Rotundo occupies the centre, and is ninety-six leet in diameter, and ninety-six high. This 
is the principal entrance from the east portico and west stair, and leads to the legislative halls aad 
library. This room is divided in its circuit into panels, by lofty Grecian pilasters or antae, which 
•support a bold entablature, ornamented with wreaths of olive — a hemispherical dome rises above, 
filled with large plain caissons, like those of the Pantheon at Kome. The pannels of the circular walls 
are appropriated to paintings and bas relieves of historical subjects. 

In the small Rotundo of the south wing, there are columns of the Tobacco, and, in the vestibule 
in front of the Hall of Representatives, of the Cotton order; because these staples have been selected 
as ornaments for their capitals, and are really not much inferior, in richness and beauty, to the Acan- 
thus leaf of the Corinthian. It was the design of Mr. Latrobe, the former architect, to make this 
edifice national, and to render it so, as far as possible, by the introduction of architectural ornaments 
derived from the principal native productions of our country. He did intend, moreover, to support 
one of the galleries of the Senate Chamber with emblematic figures of the thirteen old states, deco- 
rated with their peculiai insignia, and the models were actually made by one of those fine Italian 
artists whom he had engaged to be sent to this country ; but a neglect or refusal on the part of Con- 
gress to make the necessary appropriations, defeated his design. 

THE LIBRARY. 

Passing from the Rotundo, westerly, along the gallery of the principal stairs, the Library room 
door presents itself. This room is ninety-two feet long, thirty-four wide, and thirty-six high. It is 
divided into twelve arched alcoves, ornamented with fluted pilasters, copied from the pillars in the 
celebrated Octagon Tower at Athens. At the entrance, in the centre of the room, which is approach- 
ed from the great central Rotundo, are two columns of stone, with capitals, corresponding with those 
of the pilasters, and immediately opposite and fronting the window which leads into the western 
colonnade, stand two similar columns of stone. These pillars, with alcoves, support two galleries, 
extending nearly the whole length of the room on both sides, and divided into the same number of 
shelved recesses as the lower apartment. From these recesses springs the arch which forms the 
ceiling, elegantly ornamented with rich stucco borders, pannels, and wreaths of flowers. On the roof, 
which is about ten feet above the ceiling, are three sky lights, the walls of which are beautifully de- 
corated with stucco ornaments. The principal apartments, as well as the committee rooms, on the 
north, attached to it, are handsomely furnished with sofas, mahogany tables, desks, Brussels carpet- 
ting, etc. 

The apartment for the accommodation of the Supreme Court, on the basement story of the north 
wing, immediately below the Senate room, is of a semicircular shape, with the windows to the east 
to admit the light, which enters awkvvardly and feebly, at the backs of the judges, on the bench. The 
arches, in the ceiling diverge like the radii of a chcle, from a point over the justice seat, to the cir- 
cumference. On the wall is an emblem of justice holding her scales, in bold relief, and also.a figure 
of Fame, crowned with the rising sun, and pointing to the Constitution of the United States. The 
members of the bar are conveniently accommodated with seats and desks in the body of tjie„apart- 
ment ; and the visiters are furnished with rows of benches on the right and left wings of the centre 
of the Court. 

The Chief Justice sits in the centre of the six associate Justices — all clothed in black gowns or 
robes. 

The want of a law library in the Court for immediate and convenient reference, for the use of the 
members of the Court, was certainly a defect. The room, though small in comparison to the principal 
apartments of the Capitol, is large enough for the business of the Court. There are, however, oc- 
casions when an interesting question or a popular orator, attracts a concourse of citizens, who in that 
case, may find some difficulty in procuring seats.

east fron t— t y m p a n u m . 

T,he Genius of Araerica occupies the centre of the group. Her figure, like that of all the others, 
is colossal, and fully, (perhaps too fully,) covered with drapery. She stands on a broad unadorned 
plinth, and her right hand holds a shield, inscribed in the centre with the Ictteis U. S. A. surround- 
ed with a glory. The shield, which is of an oval form, rests on a slender altar, on the front of which 
is an oaken wreath in has relief, with the words " July 4, 1776," within it. Behind her rests a spear. 
Her head, crowned with a star, is turned over her left shoulder toward the figure of Hope, to whose 
animated address she seems to be listening with attention, but with calm self-possession. Hope is 
an enchanting, airy figure, full of fire. She gazes upon the Genius with smiles, lifts her right arm 
and hand into the air, as in an attitude of delighted anticipation, while she seems to be dwelling on 
the rising glories and all the halcyon prospects of the republic. Her left elbow rests on the stock of 
an anchor, and the left hand is bent upwards, grasping in her eagerness, a part of her drapery. But 
the Genius, to whom she speaks, instead of catching her enthusiasm, points with emphatic dignity 
to the object on her right. This is Justice : a cold chastened figure, with eyes raised toward heaven, 
holding in her right hand an unrolling scroll, on which the words " Constitution of the United 
States" appear in raised letters of gold. Her left arm is elevated, and bears the scales. She has 
neither bandage nor sword ; for in our free and happy country Justice is clear, sighted, and stands 
■with open face, respecting and comparing the rights of all; and it is in this, rather than in her puni- 
tive energies, that she is the object of the veneration of freemen. The moral of the whole is just and 
striking. However Hope may flatter, America will regard only that prosperity which is founded on 
public right and the preservation of the Constitution. Such is the design : and the execution is 
worthy of it. The figures have grace and elevation : much of the "■■meiis divinior" which is about 
the works of the ancients. The artist at first contemplated giving more of nudity ; hut he was warn- 
ed that the public sentiment in this country would not admit of it, and in his caution, he has gone 
into the opposite extreme. The head of Justice is covered with a fold of her mantle, which projects 
in a graceful form, and which, could the sun reach these figures when at the necessary elevation, 
■would cast a fine shadow on the upper part of the countenance. But it happens, unfortunately, that 
this can never take place : as, before he climbs to that angle, the pediment is either partially shaded 
by the cornice, or, together with the whole eastern front of the building, deserted by his rays altogether. 
The Eagle, which is at the feet of the Genius, and between her and the figure of Hope, is one of the 
most masterly features in the design. Not only is the geireral outline of the bird strikingly true to 
nature, but the finish of every part of it beautiful in the extreme. Its head is raised, and turned up- 
ward toward the countenance of America, while its wings are partially expanded, in act to rise, as if 
ready and eager to fly at her command. 

To point out defects is an invidious task, and one of the least welcome duties of criticism. There 
is so much of excellence ; the general idea, (which was suggested by Mr. Adams, after upwards of 
forty designs had been offered and rejected,) has been so fully and so happily expressed, that strict- 
■ures on the drapery or on the execution of particular limbs in the figures have an ungracious bear- 
ing. We will mention but two faults which strike the eye. The arm of the Genius which rests 
upon the shield, is somewhat constrained ; she seems to be holding the shield that it may be looked 
at, rather than reclining her arm upon it with unconscious ease. And the right arm of Hope, which 
is elevated, appears to be too wide at the wrist, a fault which impairs the lightness and delicacy that 
characterize the residue of the figure. But these slight defects are overlooked among the many 
beauties v.fhich surround them. 

All the figures of ihe group are colossal, being about seven and a half feet in height. A perfect 
symmetry has been.given to the form, and the attitudes are at once graceful and expressive. Viewed 
with the eye of an anatomist, the minuter parts of the human structure are developed with a dis- 
tinctness and truth which, while it displays the labor which the artist has directed to the production 
of these details, exhibits also the extent and correctness of his scientific acquirements. In the dra- 
peries of the figures there is great fehcity of execution ; the fullness, the folds and flow of the mantle, 
exhibit surpassing excellence. 

The eastern entrance to the Eotundo, from the floor of the Portico, is ornamented with two light 
and beautiful figures, in stone, in the act of crowning with laurel the bust of Washington, placed 
immediately above the door. 

The rotundo is topped by a cupola and balustrade, accessible by means of a stair-case passing be- 
tween the roof and ceiling. From this elevation the prospect which bursts upon the eye is splendid. 
Three cities are spread before you : the Potomac on one side, and the Eastern Branch on the other, 
running and rolling their waters to the ocean; a range of hills extending in a magnificent sweep 
around you, and displaying all the richness and verdure of woodland scenery, with here and there 
beautiful slopes in cultivation — the whole colored by the golden beams of the setting sun, burnishing 
the reposing clouds, and gilding the tops of the trees, or giving light and shade to the living land- 
scape — form a scene which few portions of the earth can rival, and which none can surpass. The 
dome of the centre, though nearly a semicircle, does not please the eye of a stranger; it wants greater 
or less elevation to contrast agreeably with the domes of the ■wings. 



THE BIRD OF THE WEST.

Besides the principal rooms above mentioned, two others deserve notice, from the pecuUarity of 
their architecture — the round apartments under the Rotundo, enclosing forty columns supporting 
groind arches, which form the floor of the Rotundo. This room is similar to the substructions of 
the European Cathedrals, and may take the name of Crypt from them : the other room is used by 
the Supreme Court of the United States — of the same style of architecture, with a bold and curi- 
ously arched ceiling, the columns of these rooms are of a massy Dorick imitated from the temples 
of Paestum. Twenty-five other rooms, of various sizes are appropriated to the officers of the two 
houses of Congress and of the Supreme Court, and forty-five to the use of committees ; they aieall 
vaulted and floored with brick and stone. The three principal stair-cases are spacious and varied in 
their form; these, with the vestibules and numerous corridors or passages, it would be difficul, to 
describe intelligibly : we will only say, that they are in conformity to the dignity of the building and 
style of the parts already named. The building having been situated originally on the declivity of 
a hill, occasioned the west front to show in its elevation one story of rooms below the general level 
of the east front and the ends ; to remedy this defect, and to obtain safe deposites for the large quan- 
tities of fuel annually consumed, a range of casemate arches has been projected in a semicircular 
form to the west, and a paved terrace formed over them : this addition is of great utility and beauty, 
and at a short distance exhibits the building on one uniform level — this terrace is faced with a grass 
bank, or glacis, and at some distance below, another glacis with steps leads to the level of the west 
entrance of the Porter's Lodges — these, together with the piers to the gates at the several entrances 
of the square, are in the same massy style as the basement of the building ; the whole area or square 
is surrounded with a lofty iron railing, planted and decorated with forest trees, shrubs — gravel walks 
and turf. 



THE BIRD OF T 11 U WEST 



The synod of Gods were assembled in state, 
1'— Convened in the regions above. 
When Phcebus arsing, began the debate, 
And thus he addressed father Jove : 

" Oh ! Father, as lately the coursers of day, 

Descended the road in the West, 
All faint, and exhausted, I paused in my v/av, 

To give them refreshment and rest. 

Looking down where the blue rolling ocean extends, 
Where once lay the region of Night, 

Lo ! full on my view a large continent bends, 
Ne'er seen by the beams of my Ught. 

From hence mighty rivers and lakes I surveyed 
The trees on their margins that grow, 

And mountains projecting such grandeur of shade, 
They frown on Olympus below. 

My course was so rapid, I caught but a glance. 

For had I delayed my career, 
My steeds must have checked sister Dian's ad- 
vance, 

That season to mortals so dear," 

The wing-footed Heimes the throne thus address- 
ed: 

" Oh, Father, now listen to me,— 
This Eagle I found while exploring the West, 

And here I present him to thee." 

Jove said, while the bird on his sceptre had sprung, , 
" How noble, how stately his air ! 



Now fain would I try if an Eagle so youno- 
In triumph my thunder can bear." 

The Bird seized the bolt, and resplendent he flew. 
While the Gods all beheld in amaze 

How calmly he sailed through the regions of blue, 
And bore in his talons the blaze. 

" See, Neptune !" cries Jove, " how he flashes 
along 

Now over thine empire he flies, — 
From ocean is dashed a refulgence so strong 

The lustre ascends to the skies. 

He bears in his talons my thunder so well, 

'Tis a present I cannot decline. 
Henceforth let all those on Olympus who dwell. 

Know the Bird of the West shall be mine." 

Then blue-ey'd Minerva accosted the throne — 
" Thy justice shall mortals arraign, 

Thy herald is seen in thy thunders alone, 
And man will indignant complain. 

Let Meicy and Justice thine attributes prove, 
And thus be their union expressed ; — 

The olive of Pallas and thunder of Jove, 
Be borne by the Bird of the West !" 

With biim-flowing nectar, these words they ap- 
prove, 

And this was the toast they express'd ; 
" The olive of Pallas and thunder of Jove, 

And here's to the bird of the West!" 



SWEEPINGS FROM A DRAWER 



BY W. lAJTDOH. 



1. Mark how erect is he who tieads the plain — how bent his figure who ascends the mountain, 
and you will learn that contentment, only, is uprightness, and that all ambition compels a stooping, 

2. The political and social conditions in a nation, in respect of their relation and advancement, 
co-exist like the pave and trottoir in a street ; the former of which is the arena of the woikingmen, 
and the latter the platform of the gentry. In the American constitution, nearly the whole street is 
pave ; in the English, too much is trottoir. In the one, the gentleman is muddied, and often en- 
dangered by the movements of the workingmen ; in the other, the workingman is fettered and 
cramped by the privileges of the gentry. 

3. Haughtiness is often the refuge of a weakness which is conscious that it cannot sustain itself 
in an equal encounter with its fellows. 

t 4. An author's fame will often rest upon one work, and his greatness be sustained by another 
that is less popular. We might doubt the depth and sincerity of some of Byron's most finished 
pieces if it were not for the undeniable furious power of some that are less excellent. We might 
conjecture that the images of Childe Harold were but paintings in fresco, if we did not see the so- 
tlid statues of Giaour and Corsair behind them. 

5. Happiness consists in occupation of mind. Small minds require to be occupied by affairs. 
Great minds can occupy themselves. 

6. Men-haters and men-despisers have been in action more successful, and in authorship more 
popular, than men-lovers. Witness, in the former, Cromwell, Napoleon, and Frederic ; in the lat- 
ter, Swift, Voltaire, and Byron. 

7. The whole works of any great author, (I mean such paits as are peculiarly and exclusively 
his own,) are but the development of one idea. What is the soul but an idea, and thought, but the 
application of it to things in the world 1 

8. Hell-fiie is not a lie. The passions are rightly called fiics, even to the body. 

9. Some school-masters seem to think of their pupils as the modern Greeks do of their olive 
trees, that the more they are beaten the more they thrive. 

10. Most of the sufleiings, especially the mental pains, of men arise from their efforts to regard 
and understand the world as a serious scheme ; whereas, in fact, it is all a joke. 

11. Men worship most the man that worships least. 

12. Religion is the homage which the intellect pays to the feelings. 

13. The predominance of gloomy traits in the universal popular idea of God, proves that there is- 
greater misery than happiness in the world. 

14. Whenever you hear a person undervaluing another with some degree of earnestness, be sure 
that, in his inmost soul, he is afraid of him. Sincere contempt excites a compassion that is accom- 
panied with tolerance. 

15. It is a fatally frequent error in conduct, to consider a thing trifling and unimportant because- 
it is common-place. In literature, thoughts are valueless in proportion as they are commonly ob- 
served; in action, they are important in the same ratio. 

16. Wise men never make prophecies. 

17. To the sensible and the great state yourself; to your intimates understate yourself; to the 
mob overstate yourself. 

18. Never tell a severe, sensible person, an unlikely story, even though you know it to be true. 

19. The exhibition of little peculiarities and oddities often promotes liking, but always diminishes 
respect. 

20. Never let your feelings, with regard to persons, affect your perceptions with regard to things. 

21. Never rest in first impressions, but still inquire and seek new views. 

22. If you want to impress in conversation, introduce your own topics; if you want to please, let 
your companion. 

23. The fate of thy discoveries, man of genius ! may be likened to thy experience when thou 
hast sailed up into some new countiy, on the bosom of a river ; every thing that is near flies back- 
ward from thee, and thou goest unattended and alone. But look above thee, and look beyond, and 
the heavens, and the distant parts of the earth, are moving onward with thee. 



THE PRIVATEER. 

A TALE OF THE LATE AMERICAN WAR. 

(Coiitlnueu iVom psgj 196.) 



CHAPTER VII. 

NEW ORLEANS, AFTER THE BATTLE. 

It was night, and the fairest city of the south was flashing with her miUions of lights. The 
splendid iHumination waved in spangled pillars to the skies, and flung a pavilion of living light over 
the gorgeous wilderness of squares, the suburbs, the bannered shipping, and the sleeping father of 
rivers. It was a festival of stars ; the crowded streets, the shouts of the frantic populace, the clang 
of bells, the bursts of martial music, mingled uproariously with the thunder of cannon, and the eter- 
nal rattle of vehicles, announced a mighty event. It was the night aftei the immortal eighth of Jan- 
uary, and the preserved city was one grand festive court. The conquerors were hailed with the 
grateful plaudits of their countrymen, and fair hands showered laurel wreaths on the^warrior brows 
of the veteran and the youth, the bold hunter, and the fiery cit, 

A glaring light streamed from the marble portico and richly curtained windows of an aristocratic 
mansion, in the most fashionable promenade. It lighted a crowd of glittering equipages, constantly 
coming and going, as they set down their richly attired inmates. Within, the brilliant saloon and 
columned halls sparkled in the array of elegance and wealth ; sumptuous boards were spread with 
the choicest luxuries of that garden clime. There the sounds of revelry quickened the soul into the 
passionate flow of ecstacy — music was breathing its divinest power, and voices soft and rapturous 
warbled the witchery of song. The fairest flowers of the south were gathered there to blush at their 
own loveliness. Theie beauty careered in the pomp of dress and splendor of jewelry. It was a 
fete of gems. There floated the dark, magnificent Creole — the courtly, majestic Donna — the laugh- 
ing belle Francaise, and there too was the fair-skiimed lily of the north. The chivalry of the ar- 
my and navy were there, and more than one foreign uniform and star brightened in the throng. 
Tall plumes nodded in the mazy dance, and bullion epaulettes glittered beside the orient necklaces 
of the fair. 

An hour swept on ; a gay group of military had gathered near the recess of a window — and an 
elegant one, in the tasteful dress of a French naval officer, was detailing some circumstance con- 
nected with the war, when his voice arrested a young midshipman of the American navy passing 

" Charles Harman," he exclaimed, " by all that is sacred, have you risen from the dead 1" 

" Jenkins ! I believe, my dear fellow," spoke lieutenant Harman, warmly extending his hand. 
" It is no ghost." 

" Impossible ! you have been on the dead list some six years or so. Where have you been 1" 

" At sea, like yourself, but under different colors," returned Charles, laughing. 

The astonished Jenkins drew Harman's arm within his own, and they sauntered through the 
rooms. Charles briefly sketched his history, and made anxious inquiry of his home. 

" What a surprise you will be, there," exclaimed his wondering fiiend; "I saw your father and 
sister ten months ago, when they were very well — but zounds ! they have little idea that you are in 
existence. I have been on active duty ever since. Why, that hot-headed cousin of yours, Walter 
De Beirian, who used to be such a chivahic lad at school, cleared out just before the war, and has 
never been heard of since." 

" Never !" said Harman, with anguish. " Jenkins, did you ever hear of a privateer Sea-Gull in 
your cruises 1" 

" Often, often, in '12 and '13, and a daring craft she was. She sailed from Baltimore, I believe. 
That fierce captain of hers was called the Black Boatswain on the salts. The Sea-GuU's flight 
was short and glorious. You knew her V 



238 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

Chailes dared not ask the rest ; he listened with an agony of interest as his friend continued; the 
story was short and awful. Sometime at night, in February, '13, the Sea-Gull dashed among a 
fleet of British merchantmen, oflf Cadiz, and cut out a splendid ship. The alarm was given, and a 
swift-sailing schooner of eleven guns started in pursuit. The Sea-Gull shortened sail till she came 
up, and they fought yard-arm and yard-arm for one tremendous hour. The slaughter was immense 
on both sides, yet victory perched on the flag of the Sea-Gull. Several of her officers fell, and the 
intrepid Parole himself was killed in the arms of victory. The conquerors leaped aboard their prize, 
and saw the gallant Sea-Gull go down before their eyes — a fitting sepulchre for the heroic dead she 
held. The captured schooner, being greatly cut up in the hull and rigging, was retaken at dawn 
by a frigate, and the Americans carried prisoners into Gibraltar. 

" The names of the oHicers killed 1" was the quick and painful inquiry of Charles. 

*' I never learned," said the other. 

" Jenkins," gasped Charles, " he was there — Walter, your old schoolmate, was in the Sea-Gull." 

For many minutes, Charles Harman remained leaning abstractedly on an elegant column, and 
the crimson fringe of the damask drapery half-concealed his features. Many a dark bright eye stole 
with soft and curious interest to the handsome stranger — for sympathy with those that mourn is 
woman's nature. The music, the bursts of laughter, and the tripping of the dancers' feet, fell un- 
heard upon his ear, for Harman was tranced in memory's dream. The past, the vivid past, had lift- 
ed up its curtain, and away in the embowered vale of youth he was sporting with Catharine, that 
sister so capricious, so gifted, and so loved. Nov?, dark fancy painted her in the solitude of grief. 
Cruel were the hand that could shield the sunshine from a flower so fuir ; and conscience whispered 
*' it was thine." Again he was a captive in the ocean storm, amid the blaze and thunder of a sea- 
fight, and his chivalric cousin held to him the charter of freedom, written in his own blood. Where 
was that cousin now 1 Stretched unknelled on ocean plains, or groaning in a foreign cell ! A spirit 
waved his troubled dream to a bed of sickness and pain, and that spirit stood revealed in the sweet 
child Agnes. Her clinging kiss was on his lip — her warm tears gushed upon his cheek — her voice 
of fountain tones — he started ; was it that same sweet voice, liquid and low as the echo of a lute, 
that now broke the spell of his reverie 1 

Young Harman looked up, and adored. A girl of surpassing loveliness, dressed in purest white, 
was leaning near on the arm of a naval officer, who led her out to dance. Her wonderful beauty 
was a delicious flattery to mortality. A figuie was hers, of mould so light and exquisite that sylphs, 
who had seen her would blush at the candor of their mirror. So young, so pure, and bright she 
"was, that a Peri in green Oman's waters would kneel to her as the youngest Princess of Pearls. 
Her hair, her curls, clustering redundant and — where is the word that can picture their hue 1 The 
matter-of-fact have named it auburn — but it is not that ; it has no name — language is sullen at its 
poverty. The brush, in hands that wrought for a seat among the stars, has sometimes dared to copy 
ats radiance ; but that fairer artist, nature, smiles at the presumption, and pities the failure. And 
her dove-like eyes of tremulous blue ! Love would have chosen them for its lustrous throne — but, 
alas, the meagieness of description ! Who that has seen the moon rise over a silent sea, can forbear 
a smile when he reads of it ] That lovely girl WEts the star of the festival. 

The music struck up — the dance swept on ; the star floateii amid the galaxy of lesser lights, bright 
as her sisters in heaven. Suddenly, the star was arrested in her graceful sphere; she had caught, 
the adoring light of Charles Harman's eye. Joy, surprise, fear, and wildest inquiiy, were written- 
in her gaze ; but instantly the bright creature blushed, and her eyes were hid under a pair of exqui- 
site lashes. Harman was rivetled to the spot; for more than once, in the mazy whirl of the cotil- 
lion, he met a tell-tale glance from those same timid eyes. 

'.' Ha ! my noble foreigner," said Jenkins, coming up and tapping him on the shoulder, " doing 
homage to the beautiful Agnes 7 No wonder — she is the faiiest rose where all are roses." 

" Agnes, did you say ]" 

" Yes, Agnes Wood'ville — her father is a jolly old Virginian, who came to the city some ten yeais 
ago, and is now im.mensely rich. His daughter is just out, and already she is the Lily of New Or- 
leans." 

" Heavens ! it is she !" 

" Hallo — what is the fuss 1 You know her then V 

'■l thought I had seen her before," returned Charles, with the blush of a schoolboy. 

" Zounds ! I think she has seen you before, if blushes tell. ' We met — 'twas in a crowd,' " and 
the gay middy went humming along. 

The dance was just over, and Agnes, mantling with exercise and beauty, was led to a seat amid 
an involuntary murmur of applause. A throng of admirers crowded around her, and among the 
youthful, more than one hero of silver hairs passed the homage of compliments that would befit the 
proudest court. Her partner had hurried for refreshments, when lieutenant Harman caught his aroi 
and begged an introduction. 

" You, Harman 1 no, you are too d d good looking." 

" Selfish ! — if you would have my eternal gratitude, remember my name is not Harman. Don't 
ask questions — introduce me as Brown, Smith, Jones — any thing." 



THE PRIVATEER. 239 

" Aha ! come along, I will immolate self; but those are odd names (or a Frenchman." 

" De Melville, then," said Charles, laughing. 

De Melville was introduced. At the name, Agnes looked up; there was something of disappoint- 
ment in her eyes, yet she might well have been mistaken. It was six years since she saw the lover 
of her childhood, and six years bring many changes. Charles was taller now, dressed en militaire, 
and, in keeping with the profession of arms, he wore a superb moustache and whiskers ; his com- 
plexion had a southron tint, his expression was saddened, and his manner the calm hauteur of one 
who has seen and observed the world. Embarrassed amid a profusion of compliments, the niiive 
Agnes' replies were confused, and Harman, with high-bred adroitness, sought her hand for the en- 
suing dance — it thrilled as he led her triumphantly to the floor. There was a curl on her lip of 
some inward delight ; for she hud heard his voice. What disguise can baffle the eyes of love, es- 
pecially when those eyes belong to a woman 1 

Agnes Woodville was nearly seventeen — a half-blown rose, shrinking in its first timid glance on 
the beautiful world, yet smiling through its blushes. Alone with he), in the vokiptuous dance, 
where their hands met so often, and her every smile and word were his, the happy Harman was in- 
spired. The case and brilliancy of his conversation astonished himself, and spell-bound his partner. 
Her girlish hesitation vanisheri at the magic of his elegant address, and her sweet low laugh was 
less often checked by a blush. Her whole soul seemed to revel in its lirst glad taste of a new de- 
light, and unconsciously her tones were thrilling, and her looks wore a blissful tenderness fresh from 
an artless heart. 

The hours fled on their lightest wings, and Charles and Agnes were walking in the spacious gar- 
den of the festal mansion. Many others had escaped from the heated room, and from every walk 
meny voices were ringing in chaste or bi^oken French and Spanish. It was winter — if such a name 
can be given to the hazy slumber of the seasons in that sunny clime — the air was mild, and the 
lising iiioon shone as soft on the jewelled tresses of the belle and the lace of the military, as when 
pearling the orange blossoms. 

Harman and his lovely charge were afloat on the Vviizard current of talk. They culled the choic- 
est flowers that perfumed its banks, and wreathed each other's brows. They tasted the tempting 
fruit that overhung, and gathered the rarest gems on the fountain floor. It was " the feast of rea- 
son" — no not reason, that cool closet reason, that exact matter of rule and measure, of cause and 
effect — it was passion's feast and the flow of soul. O, there is a spell of deep deliciousness in the 
converse of kindred souls, more powerful far than heavenly music ! 

As yet no allusion had been made to their former delightful intimacy Now that they had drawn 
out each other's powers in the biilliaat play of mind each feared that the other had forgotten. " It 
is time," thought Charles, and he quivered with dread lest the precious prize might escape. 

" How strange," he began, with an air of sentiment, " is the harmony of names and natures ! It 
was a beautiful idea to give language and poetry to flowers ; music they had already. Who that 
hears the name of lily, does not associate it at once with music and loveliness 1 Agnes Woodville ! 
there is a melody in those gentle syllables that has lingered on my ear for six long years ; it has 
floated in m}^ dreams, and in the moonlit watch I've caught its harmony from the sighing waves, 
and fancied a Peri v/as singing near. Was this not a lay of delight, sung by the minstrel Hope to 
the soul, when it was troubled at dark futuiity 1 One of that worshipped name did once minister 
to my sickness ; she was then a child — but how lovely she must be grown now, and very bcauiiful ! 
We loved — and she promised to be my little wife." 

The girl looked up. " Would you know her now ?" 

" Yes, among a thousand." 

A wicked laugh rang on the air. 

" Then," said Agnes, " I must presume that you cut my acquaintance." 

" Oh, rapture ! it is — you are my little wife !" 

" How very w^ell done!" wickedly exclaimed the girl ; " and when did you get the name of De 
Melville, sir 1 Oh, that I had changed mine, too !" 

" Forgive me, my lily; it was love that taught the fraud. You have not forgotten I" 

" No — but you don't deserve it." 

" Agnes, sweetest," he passionately spoke, " our promise shall be redeemed ?" 

That soft hand slightly returned the pressure of his, and Harman murmured " my little wife," as 
he printed love's hallowed seal on her lips. 

" Let us go," whispered the blushing girl, and the lovers, silent and happy irr the tieasure of each 
other, sought the lighted halls again. 

" Aggy, my puss, it is late, and I have been looking for you," said a rosy old gentleman, slightly 
bowing to Charles. 

" Father," said the girl, " don't you knovs^ Mr. Harman"!" 

" Why, bless me — rso it is ! Hurrah, Eny young adventurer, I'm delighted to see you." 

Young Harman warmly greeted his generous friend, and the happy old gentleman, thanks to 
champagne, rattled and asked a thousand questions.

" Come, come — go home with us this very night," he said, as Charles was reluctantly handing 
his own Agnes into the carriage. 

" What, no 1 — then, to-morrow, at No, — St. ; I am dying to hear your story." 

" So am I," said the last look of his daughter. 



CHAPTER Till. 

THE WANDERER'S HOME. 

oh, weep rot for the dead. 
No more tor them the blightinf; dull, 
'I'he thousand shades of earthly ill. 

The thousand thorns we tread ; 
"Weep for the life-charm early flown, 
The spirit broken, bleediup, lone ; 
Weep for the death-paiiga of the heart, 
Ere being from its bos'.m part. 
But nevi-r be a tear-drop given 
For these that rtst in ion blue heaven. 

Miss Mary E. Brooks. 

It was neatly three months after the incidents of the last chapter, that hectoring March, like some 
extravagant " blood" who reforms in his last days, woke up delighted one morning, and lavished his 
sweetest smile on the elegant family mansion of the Hat mans. It was a morning of promise and 
mirth. Nature reposed voluptuously in her moVning gown of sunshiny haze. The sky, the sea, 
and hills, were bathed in a flood of mysterious light which may well be called the atmosphere of 
poetry, the soft contagion of love and sentiment, the airy cradle of dreams that never redeem their 
promise, of changes that never change. It was a season when the future is fair as the enchanted 
distance, and elated man smiles at the lesson of the past. The mansion stood in the same delight- 
ful spot, yet it seemed smaller than when we left it three years ago. The carpet lawns, the leafless 
groves and avenues, and the pretty ovit-houses, had gathered, it seemed, into a smaller space. The 
blue hills in the back-ground had stolen nearer to the bay, which itself looked more river-like than 
of old, and its dim floating line beyond was no longer the limit of the world. Every thing around, 
however, was laughing in peace and sunshine, as if no longer fearing the rude visit of war. There 
was something of glee even in the smoke that wound so solemnly aloft on a calm spring morning, 
giving the idea of the fire's funeral train ; for henceforth the myrtle and fragrant lilac usurp its place 
in the hearth. The merry robin piped a thankful note to find his last summer's nest safe in its tree- 
foik; the hermit sparrow, who had spent a grave winter, drawn up, philosopher-like, under a haw- 
thorn shed of snow, now stretched himself out, and hopped a fandango to his own music among 
the naked shrubbery. Larks were singing in the fields ; flocks of blackbirds chattered from the 
trees ; and often the flute-like whistle of the partridge swelled from the distant heJge. The broad 
and tranquil bay was spangled with fragments of ice, on many of which sea-gulls were perched to 
devour their prey. Several sail were standing listlessly on the ample sheet; and away from the 
shore, at the long blue hne of deep water, whole acres of wild fowl were gathered in council, pre- 
paratory to their annual migration. Nearer in, numerous flocks of dippers frolicked around the 
bank ; the beautiful swans had long since gone, and now the wild geese were on the wing and their 
wild bugle notes floated to the sky. 

On that balmy morning, Catharine Harman, the last of her name, and sole mistress of a splendid 
estate, the gifted belle and the bereaved orphan, the mirror of fortune's brightest smiles and darkest 
frowns, had wandered without attendants to her favorite grove, and reclined herself on a vine-shel- 
tered seat by the shore. She was dressed in deepest mourning, and there was something of holy 
harmony in its contrast with her unearthly beauty. Just before the end of the war, her father had 
died of the gout, like a true gentleman as he was; and his last breath was a prayer for his proud 
nephew's return, and his daughter's happiness. The orphan clung to her father's grave, and felt 
that she was desolate. At the winter's eve she would linger there, and murmur with the chilling 
winds,'" I am alone ;" and then came the memory of her cousin, so proud, so wronged, and now so 
wildly loved ! Often would she steal, on the cold moonlight nights, to the lonely shore, to pray for 
the absent, and wonder at his fate. And oh ! could he have seen that face in tears for him, and 
heard the wild and melancholy blessing of his name, what then would have been the struggles of 
pride, the hopes of fame, to the priceless homage of such a heart — the prayer of a lip so pure? 

Catharine had changed ; for she was no more a coquette. Ah, when the heart has once felt the 
bitterness of unhappy love, its anguish is no more a mockery. From that fatal evening when the 
offended beauty had driven her injured cousin from her presence for ever, " a change came over the 
spirit of her dream." It was a first and bitter lesson in that unread tome of mysteries, the human 
heart. The wand was struck from the enchantress' hand, and she was poring over her own hidden 
couplets. She read them — they spoke of love for her noble cousin ; deep, eternal, and breathing of 
worship, was that love. 



THE PRIVATEER. 241 

Catharine had changed ; for her exceeding loveliness was stripped of its scorn and hauteur. There 
was a lonely and tender sadness in her matchless features, more fatal to the heart than the blandest 
lines of the conscious beauty. Three years and accusing regret had wept from her eyes the fire of 
the morning sun, but left in its place the mournful poetry of the star. Sorrow might have stolen a 
rose from her cheek, but a softer lily slept in its stead. Before, she was the laughing wave of the 
ocean, singing with the summer wind, and splendid in its glee ; now, she was that wave, exquisite 
in its weeping roll, when left by the wind that gave it life. 

The orphan lady sat long and musingly by the shore. The soft influence of the season stole 
cheeringly over her soul. She smiled so like the Catharine of happier days, and there was a thought 
so fond and eloquent in that smile, as would lure cherubs down from their palaces of clouds. 

" Surely," said the lady, as she flung back the crowding ringlets from her cheek, and her dark eye 
flashed, and her ripe lip cuiled with a meaning so like her former self; " surely that Power who 
gave this beautiful world its life, will not mark me for a cheerless pilgrimage through its singing- 
vales. Have 1 not suffered enough — a mother, a brother, a father, and my cousin who always loved 
me ! My thoughtless sin is bitterly atoned, and could he know all he would forgive — he did forgive 
me even when my curse was spoken I Oh, yes, he will come back and say, ' See, dearest, my life 
shall be a delightful task to make thee happy !' Oh, eternal hope, like the watch-light on the stormy 
coast, thou shinest the brighter for the darkness of the future. Has that future no bright spot fot 
mel" and her eyes rested on a fleecy spot, away down on the scarce-defined bosom of the bay. Ca- 
tharine watched it with a half attentive interest ; and when, after an hour, it came up with the morn- 
ing breeze, and emerged from the distance, a tall and splendid packet-brig, a wish, wild, thrilling, 
and tremulous, found utterance on her lips. 

" That bark," she whispered, " is freighted with the destiny of many hearts — perhaps of mine?" 
Sweeping the curls from her eyes, she looked again, and the brig, like a stately swan just alighting, 
suddenly furled her snowy wings, and dropped anchor a half mile off, just opposite the grove. A 
boat was lowered — she saw it — it rowed towards her — she saw the silvery oars glancing in the sun, 
the glazed hats of the sailors, and the group of dark forms astern ; she caught a glance of something 
like a female dress, and how strange that she should feel an instant pang — a dread she knew not of 
■what ! The boat came nearer — a tall form stood up in the stern, as if eager to spring to land, and 
she saw the gleam of naval buttons ; but, suddenly, the boat had swept around a beautiful slope to- 
wards the landing, in a mimic bay, on the northern side of the mansion. 

Trembling and agitated, she knew not why, Catharine Harman hurried towards the house. At 
the gate of the lawn, she met her favorite servant. The girl was almost out of bieath. 

" Mercy ! what is the matter, Sarah 1" asked Catharine. 

'• Oh, Miss Kitty, I'm so agitated — don't know who they are — it is a very pretty lady, almost as 
pretty as my mistress, and a gentleman favors poor dead Mas Charley, he's so handsome — but ah, 
poor young master !" 

" Hush :" 

Pale and faint, she leaned on the servant's arm, and they flew to the house. 

" I showed 'em in the front parlor," said the girl, " but don't go in now, my dear mistress, you 
look so sick." 

" Leave me," said Catharine, in a whisper ; " I am well." Her cold hand was on the bolt — she 
stopped — then opened it with a shuddet. 

A girl whose almost infantile loveliness would shame the faiiest plaything of the pencil bounded 
with out-stretched arms from a sofa, and stood a living, eager, beautiful statue of impulse. The 
mournful yet splendid beauty of the superb woman before her — her form of such elegant mould, 
and her features so finished — faultless, yet so like his — seemed to have overpowered the innocent 
creature in her haste. Catharine was rooted to the spot ; and the girl sunk to the floor like a dying 
flower, and murmured gently — '* Sister !" 

" Sister !" burst wildly from Charles Harman, as he threw aside a folding dooi, and sprang to her 
side. 

Catharine stood white and hushed as the chiselled inspiration of the sculptor. 

" Speak to me, Catharine, my own sister," and the lady was strained convulsively to her brother's 
bosom. 

" Sister," she slowly repeated, as if talking to spirits of air, " I am no sister !" 

" Catharine ! Catharine ! I am your own brother Charles ! Speak — oh, tell me that you know 
me!" 

Reeling like an exquisite statue shaken from its base, she swooned on hei brother's bosom. For 
many minutes of intensest interest, Catharine was stretched upon the sofa, in the embrace of the 
agonized Charles ; her hair had .showered in dancing masses around, in vivid contrast with the fear- 
ful white of her features. The lovely girl at her side was endeavoring with caresses to win her back 
to life. 

" See, Agnes," said Charles, " she recovers." 

" It was a sweet dream," heavily whispered Catharine ; " oh, come back again !" 

" Sister, it is no dream," ' 



242 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" That voice — Charles ?" 

" Catharine !" 

A searching glance, a scream of delirious joy, and the frantic lady poured a flood of delicious tears 
on the neck of her long-mourned brother. When she looked up again, an arm as soft and fair as 
her own stole around her neck, and the weeping Agnes drew their lips together. Charles Harman^ 
placed her lily hand in that of the bewildered Catharine, and fondly said — " My wife." 

And a happy day was that. The strange news of young Harman's life and return flew over the 
estate like a prairie fire. The wondering negroes capered and flew to the " great house," to see the 
dead alive. Those only who have witnessed the return of a travelling '• young master," can form 
any idea of the outbreak. Every soul, young and old, man, woman, child, set into dancing as if 
for life. With a negro, dancing is the out-pouring of the soul ; it is his lehgion and poetry. Never 
was there such a scene of jollity since the prime days of their fox-hunting " old master." A month 
passed amid the wonder and congratulations of friends.

LIFE . 



How transient! yet how wearisome it seems! 
In inlancy, like flower of early spring. 
It struggles on, as weak and frail a thing ; 

Then youth, and with it pass those golden dreams 

That have the innei temple of the heart 
Ulura'd with joy above the worldly kind, 
But, ah ! too transitoiy — too refined I 

Then comes mid-age, most prone to guilt and art, 

Ai'arice, exulting in his baneful power. 
Impelling onward to ingloiious ends. 

Till in old age is wept the bitter hour 
Of birth, and penitence at last befriends, 

Or in despair, when all with ill seems fraught. 

Death as a speedy antidote is sought. 



DEATH. 

How dreadful 'tis to some — by others thought 
A peaceful, though a dark and lonesome sleep ; 
And they who solemn vigils strictly keep. 

And worship Heaven in truth, have wished for nought 

Less terrible more earnestly than this ; 

Ye tired pilgrims journeying here below, y 
Weary and heart-sick of a world of wo, 

Longing for immortality and bliss — 

Ye world-adoring mortals ! then prepare. 

Make pure your hearts, that God may enter in. 
For it is terrible to die in sin ; 

The dread Hereafter foolishly to dare. 

To have your spirits, wingless, doomed to dwell 

Forever in Corruption's loathsome cell.

THE MAGIC FIDDLE 



A FORECASTLE YARN 



Talk o' music — you should a' beared my old messmate Jack Splice, or " King Jack," as we after- 
wards called him, play on the wi-o-lin : it would have done youi hearts good. Ah ! Jack did with 
his fiddle what our guffees never did with their baggonets ashore ; he saved the lives of a boat's 
crew ; and more nor that, married a gov'nor's daughter, and was made King of the Island, and all 
along cause of his being sich a rare hand on the fiddle. Ah ! you may snigger, my hearties, and 
thimk I'm running my chaffing ta'kle out, and coming Tom Pepper over ye, as was kicked out down 
below cause of his pitching it too strong ; but I'm blessed ! if the yarn isn't as true as that I'm capt'n 

o' the foretop o' this Her Maj'sty's ship B . But you shall hear the sarcumstances jist for all the 

world as they happened. 

Ye see, my boys, when I was a young 'un I first of all tried my hand in the marchant sarvice, 
and having a straight-for'ard kindly sort o' a skipper, I took a trip or two in a trader to the West 
Ingees. The " William," as she was called, was a long wall-sided craft, with sich a sheer as ye 
never seed. Well, for the matter o' that she was decent enough for a maichantm'n, and if her decks 
war'n't holy-stoned as this here is, why there was some'ut less to do. In them 'eie days there was 
none o' your must'rings and 'spections, piping up and piping away, and exercises at great guns and 
small arms, as one sees and feels a-board a king's ship, and that too when an honest man might be 
taking his quid in peace, and be never the worse seaman ; but I must belay my jaw-tacks, or may- 
hap the off' sir o' the watch mayn't like my 'pinion o' these here matters — not but all on ye knows 
I'll stick by the sarvice as long as my old timbers can lay out on a yard. Well, it was my third 
trip in the ship William, and we started with a fair wind from the Thames in the spring o' the year 
for Cuba. We carried out with us, besides our cargo, a lot o' pass'ngers. There was a young 
madam, the sweetest cretur ye ever knowed, a daughter o' a gov'noi o' one of the West Ingee islands, 
with an old lady and two sarvants to wait on her ; and then there was a couple o' planter chaps, as 
yellow as a quar'nline flag, together with a young sodger ofl'sir. But the best man o' the ship, 
for'ard or aft, was Jack Splice ! He was a pictur o' a seaman to look on, and though more of a 
youngster than an oldster, he could hand a sail or box the compass with e'er a blue jacket as ever 
sailed. The gals ashore said as how he was the prettiest lad they ever clapped eyes on, while the 
oldest on the crew 'knowledged he was the smartest hand they ever seed aloft, and so Jack was — I 
never knowed his like. But Lord bless ye ! this valeys as nothing to Jack's playing on the fiddle : 
it was sweeter nor any thing you ever beared. Jack was the boy to make ye dance : give me six- 
watei giog ! if there was ever a man as could well keep his legs steady when he struck up " Jack's 
AUve," or the " C'lege Hornpipe." Ah ! I've seed Jack play and foot it at the same time — coming 
the double shufile and toe and heel touch, as never a player-m'n a-port could. 

Well, as long as the fair weather lasted, the watches went pleasant, as we had Jack's fiddle, and 
now and then may-be a can o' grog from the pass'ngers. We had been running afore the wind for 
three weeks, when, after chopping about for a matter o' two days, it shifted, and a reg'lar lot o' 
heavy gales from the nor'-west set in. Well, we were 'bliged to shorten sail, and stand to the 
south'rd, but it wouldn't do, there were so many hands at the bellows we were forced to scud for it 
for three days, a dead loss on the log, as the first mate said. On the fourth day the wind went down 
a bit, and shifted a few pints round to the west, though it still continued to blow fresh. I had just 
turned out with the second mate and six hands for the morning watch, and the ship was buckling- 
to agin under courses and reefed to'sels on the starboard tack, when all ot once a hand for'ard sings 
out " breakers a-head !" The skipper as was on deck had just time to pipe all hands, that the ship 
might be put about, when she ran dead on to a coral reef, the formast smashing off by the board, 
and ev'ry man being pitched off his legs. Well, there the ship stuck, as fast as if she had been on 
the stocks, a long heavy sea making clean breaches over her groaning timbers as she lay cast over 
to leward. Well, what with the screeching o' the poor young madam and her women — the cries o' 
the other pass'ngers, and the roaring o' the breakers as dashed over the decks, it was enough to have

shook the stoutest heart. Ye see it wasn't a time for thinkine, but doing, and all hands were soon 
hard at work cutting away the wreck o' the foremast, and heaving over the cargo as could be got at 
to lighten the ship. The mizen was cut away and tlren she righted a bit, but we all soon seed there 
■was never a chance of getting her off, as the tide was leaving her fast, and it was too rough to have 
carried out the best bower to have hove upon ; and to make matters worse nor ever, the long boat 
was stove in, agin the larboard bul'ark by the second sea, as washed over the ship when she'd struck. 
Fort'nately the tide as it went down left us nigh high and dry, and then we seed as how the old 
barkey was struck hard between two rocks, with part o' her bottom and counter rig'larly smashed, 
so as she'd never a' floated together in deep water. Though the skipper had a stout heart, he said 
the next tide would finish her and all aboard if Prov'dence didn't send a sail that way. Part o' the 
crew were put to keep two short nine-pounders we had aboard firing by turns, while the other hands 
were keeping a bright look-out for a sail, or getting up provisions. Well, it was a black look-out 
as you may think my lads, as there seemed a pretty sartainty of our being all sent to Davy Jones. 
Some o' the crew had managed to get at a puncheon o' rum, and swearing they would die jolly, had 
got " three sheets in the wind," and were tumbling about the deck, and oaths and curses was mixed 
'long with cries and pray'rs o' the pass'ngers. Well, the tide as was to break up the poor old barkey 
had turned, and the breakers, as white as milk, had just come rolling round the ship, pitching the 
spray on our decks, when Jack sung out — 

" A sail ! a sail !" And sure enough there was a sail as could jist be diskivered, which set most 
of us nigh mad with joy. 

Our guns were kept blazing away ; and for fear she should not see us, though we had our main- 
mast with our buntin revarsed in the wind. Jack sets to — he could turn his hand to any thing — and 
makes what lie called a " smoke devil" of tar and powder, which he claps in a stone jar. Taking 
this up aloft, he makes it taut to the topmast, and setting it a-fire, a thick black smoke shot up into 
the sky. The stranger, we soon saw, seed it, as she put about and came scudding like a gull afore 
the wind, while all, as could, gave a cheer o' joy. We soon made her out to be a schooner, a riglar 
looking clipper, of about ninety ton, with a yellow streak just above her water-mark, and her decks 
filled with men. Giving the helm a sheer port, she brought up within half cable o' the reef, when a 
bluff-looking chap, in a red cap, hailed — 

"What wreck is that?" 

" The William from London, bound to Cuba," replied the skipper, " for God's sake send your 
boat, as we have but one left." 

The poor young madam and the other pass'ngers were giving thanks to Prov'dence, and the sober 
hands were feeling light at heart, getting the little jolly-boat ready in the davit ta'kles to lower. But 
the schooner's crew, 'sted o' manning their boat away, began jabbering among themselves for a 
minute or two, when the same voice as hailed afore sung out — 

" We're sorry, but we can't bear a hand, as we're closely stowed already," and clapping her helm 
hard down the schooner luffed up in the wind and bore away. 

If you'd a-heared the screams and cries of all the poor creturs aboard our bark when the schooner, 
like a cursed craft as she was, left us, as we all thought, to feed the maws of the fishes — you'd never 
a-forgot it — it would a touched the heart of a savage. We were now as it were worser off nor 
ever — the men refused to 'bey the skipper and mates, and it was every one for himself and God for 
us all. The first and second mates said as how it warn't any use to stay by the wreck, and they'd 
try the boat with the rnen as would go with 'em. Well, the skipper, third mate, and Jack, told 'em 
they'd be sure to be swamped ; but it was never no use, and they'd have a try to reach land, as they 
couldn't well be far from some o' the islands in the Carribce Sea. After putting a quarter cask o' 
water, and some wine and junk as they'd got up from the ship's 'tween-decks, they were lowered 
away from the leward side, theie being three men and the two mates in the bit o' a jolly. Off she 
put, and we seed her clear the breakers and get into a long and heavy sea, which carried her aloft 
as though a walnut-shell, and then stowed her from our sight. Presently a sea pooped her, we heard 
a cry come down on the wind, and then seed the galley floating keel up'ards, but never a hand hold- 
ing on by her; her crew had become meat for the shirks about that black leef. Well, all thought 
now there was never a chance of living to see land again. The breakers came washing higher over 
the wreck, every sea making the ship's timbers groan agin, when Jack, as was a trying to comfort 
the young madam — for along of his music ye see he was a bit o' afav'rite with the young missus — 
when all at once he jumps up and sings out — 

" Come, my hearties, never say die, I've knowed a raft live where never a boat could." 

" Ay, ay, a raft ! a raft !" sung out some o' the hands. 

Though the carpenter was laying dead drunk, like a lubber as he was. Jack set-to, along with me 
and two others, like a good one. The skipper shook his head, along with the third mate, as though 
it was never no good, but when they seed how knowingly and strong Jack lashed some spare spars 
and quarter-casks together, making a flush deck along with the ship's planks, my eyes ! they all on 
'em began to think o' Jack's hand-craft as ofFiing a chance. After the float was made Jack, splitting 
up some o' the bul'ark o' the ship, makes a sort o' hand-rail round the raft. All hands then — there 
warn't but eight — had a hard matter to get the raft over. My eyes ! it floated like a cork ; and putting 



THE MAGIC FIDDLE. 245 

a couple o' lads iii her, with two o' the long-l)oat's oars to keep the float from being foul o' the 
wreck, Jack, who was the life now aboard, set about getting up some victuals from the hold, that by 
this time, ye see, had a matter of six foot water. What with diving and rummaging about, Jack 
managed to loosen some o' the casks o' junk and water, and this, with a few bottles o' wine as he 
fished up, was handed down into the raft. By this time the sea was coming, tearing around and 
breaking over the wreck, carrying over two of the drunken hands, and making the others hold hard 
on the lee side o' the wreck clo*e where the raft floated, the poor barkey all the while groaning as 
though she knowed her time was come. 

Well, pass'ngeis, and what there was left o' the crew, were now anxious enough to get on the 
raft, as sea after sea came 'pon us, lifting the wreck, and striking her heavily on the reef; but Jack 
was 'gaged in getting a bit of a sail for the jury-mast of the raft. Well, wc hands this over, with a 
lot o' ratlin for lashing the cargo well together, and then Jack shoves over his fiddle in a box, which 
he had stowed away in an old sail when the ship first struck, saying as how he'd live to play many 
a tune yet ; and so he did, as how my hearties you shall all soon hear. All being ready, and the 
cargo made taut on tlie raft, we were all about to get the ladies and pass'ngcrs in, when the skipper 
sung out to hold hard, as a heavy sea was a-coming. We turned and seed it as big as a mountain — 
Lord, what a minute for us poor souls ! — it took the water-logged old baik up like a stick, and then 
smashed her down further up on the reef into a thousand pieces. But one loud sing out, in which 
the stoutest hearts joined, and we were all in among the wreck and the breakers. Luckily I came 
up close agin the raft, and was hauled a-board by the two men in no time. Though we kept a bright 
look-out to pick up any hands, few o' them rose after their first duck, cause o' the floating timbers 
which smashed against 'cm, so that we could only manage at first to pick up the skipper, and the 
sodger off 'sir, and a man. Presently I caught a sight o' poor Jack a couple o' boats' length off 
a-making for the raft, and holding up the young missus. He was just spent, poor fellow, when I 
heaved over the end o' an oar, which he laid hold on, and we hauled them both on to the raft. Well, 
for a time we were all feared o' being smashed by some o' the wieck as floated around us, as well, 
ye see, as being washed off the raft, which had got low in the water. Howsomdever, by making a 
few stretches o' ratlin across the spars we managed to hold on and get dear o' the reef Well, the 
first thing Jack and the skipper did, was to pour a little rum down the young madam's throat, 
which brought her to a bit, and then a glass was sarved round in an old tin pot as I had thrown on 
the raft. 

Well, there were eight on us drifting away on a bit o' a raft on a strong sea, as came over us 
nigh every minute. Fort'nately Jack's work held on strong, and the skipper had hopes of falling 
in with some o' the islands as he said laid about them latitudes. Well, the wind went down with 
the tide, and the night — sich a night may I never see again ! — passed, and we found ourselves in 
the morning's light cold, wet, and hungry, with never a land or sail in sight. Give me nine-water 
grog, if it warn't a blue look-out ; and, to make matters worse, a bag o' biscuit as we had kivered 
with a sail, was quite salt with the water, so that the little sarved out by the skipper only made us 
want to drink more, and each of us was only 'lowed a quarter pint a day. Well, in this miserable 
sitivalion one — two — three days past, the wine all gone, and our fresh water nigh out, and we all 
mad for drhik. But I aint going to spin ye a yarn o' the teirible feelings and doings on that raft, 
where there wasn't one that didn't wish he'd gone to Dav3r with the wreck. On the fifth day the 
•water was all gone — no sail, no land — the wind had gone down, and the sun was shining hotly 
upon our bhstered bodies as though it would bake us. Bill Stayling, one o' the hands as had charge 
o' the raft when the ship broke up, was lying dead, and we too weak to heave him overboard ; the 
poor old skipper was fast going, he did nothing but talk o' " land," but it was a better land nor we 
could see where he was soon to go. Poor Jack, as had tried to cheer us up to the last, could hardly 
speak, still he held up the poor young madam in his arms. Ah! poor Jack bad nursed her as a 
father would his child, and even made her take part o' his share o' the 'lowance o' v?ater while it 
lasted, and that too when he was nigh crazy for the want o' it himself Well, the sea was as smooth 
as glass as we drifted along, while a lot o' shovel-nosed shirks weie frisking about the raft, as though 
the cursed cretuvs knowed there was a feed for them aboard. Well, there were but seven of us now- 
left, the skipper, the young sodger ofTsir, three hands beside myself, and the young madam. Well, 
one or two began to look quite wild and fierce, and there was a sort o' whisper or two in which the 
sodger ofl^sir was consarned, and then the terrible truth on it come out — which man was to die that 
the others might live a bit longer, in chance of being picked up. The poor skipper shook his head, 
and poor Jack tried to argufy against it, but he was too weak, and the poor young madam, as lay 
with her head agin his arm and her eyes staring, only gripped his shoulder, which she had hold on, 
harder. But the sodger ofl"'sir and others said it was better one should die than all. Howsomdever 
he said they'd wait another day. Well, I'd as lieve died as not; but half a hour after this, looking 
ahead, I screeched out for joy — oh it was joy I felt sich as I had never felt afore, though it nigh 
choked me, and it was more nor a minute afore I could say " land ahead !" Poor Jack and the 
others seemed to doubt, as there had been so many cries afoic of land, but looking ahead there was 
a blue streak as grew darker and darker nigh every minute. " It is — it is land !" cried Jack " God be 
praised !" 



246 BURTOx^'s gentleman's magazine. 

" Amen !" says the poor skipper, quite solemn-like, with a heavy sigh. I looked on him — he had 
jist gone to that ere land, where there's never no sorrow or care, as the chaplain says. 

Well, we drifted and drifted each minute closer to the shore, which we made out to be an island, 
and it seemed as if the varmint o' shirks, splashing their tails about the raft, seemed to think we 
should 'scape their maws. One of 'em, turning up his white belly, got hold on the arm o' poor 
Stayling, as it half hung over the water, and gripped it off at the elbow, and tried hard to pull the 
body over the raft — the ravenous cretur ! 

The current had carried us within a stone's cast o' the island, which riz high from the sea, and 
showed a fine sandy bay, for which Vfe were fast making ; when presently we seed a lot o' naked 
savages come running down to the beach and launch their canoes, which they paddled towards us. 
Presently they came alongside ; we could only hold our hands up, as though axing them to bear a 
haird with a little help, but, my eyes ! they hung back a-feared at our atomy looks, and held their 
spears as though they'd a mind to finish us. Next minute howsomdever a big fellow, with sich a 
pair of fierce black blinkers as I never seed afore — he was a chief, as we afterwards found out — 
stopped 'em. Giving the savages in his canoe some o' his Indee lingo, they took our raft in tow, 
and carrying us into a little creek in the bay, lifted us one after t' other out o' the raft on to the 
shore, 'mong a hundred or two savages who had come down to see us. They then 'gan breaking 
and stripping the iron out o' the wood o' the raft, and after taking our jackets and some other things 
away, the big chief ordered some o' his people to carry us to a hut he pointed out, on a bit of a hill 
as looked over the bay. Some o' the savages, taking us up like so many children, and we didn't 
weigh no more, soon took us up to the hut which waskiveied over with plantain leaves. They were 
then a-going to leave us, when those as could, put their hands to their mouths to show them we 
wanted diink, and some o' the young savages running out came in with calabashes o' water. Lord- 
a-mercy I I never knowed the real pleasures o' drinking till then, and though the young sodger 
offsir, after he had taken a strong pull at a calabash, said we should kill ourselves if we drank too 
much, yet I'm blessed if we didn't swill like good'uns. Oh ! that water was sweeter nor ye can 
think, my hearties. After getting a few yams to eat, the savages left us for the night, though they 
drawed a sort o' a hurdle afore the hole as served for a door, so as we mightn't escape. 

Well, the savages came at daylight in the morning, and gave us some yams and fish, and seemed 
precious kind, patting us on the back, although they would't let us go above a yard or two outside 
the hut. As we had never a bench to sit on. Jack made a kind o' chair for the young madam out 
o' some sticks, and with a little ratlin as had escaped the savages. As I said afore, they'd taken our 
jackets and shoes, and would a' taken our breeches but that they warn't worth the trouble. But 
howsomdever they gave us plenty o' yams and fish, as they cooked for us in holes in the ground, 
which they made hot with burning stones, so that in three or four days we were getting quite round, 
all but the sodger off' sir, and as he would pick a piece o' poor Jack Stayling, and drink salt water 
on the raft, he got worse and worse and died, and was carried out by the Indees. About a week 
after we had been ashore, and when we had larnt to understand a few words o' their lingo, we were 
sitting together wondering what the Indees meant by not allowiiig us to go out, when a lot o' young 
savages, boys and girls, comes sky-larking around us in the crib. Well, presently I notices a young 
shaver as he was a chewing apiece o' fresh pork seemingly, which he held in his fist, and I mention- 
ed the sarcumstance to Jack. " Pork !" says Jack, as he snatched the bit from the boy's hand, 
"may I never see a Christian shore agin if it aint a piece of a man's hand and arm half biled." And 
sure enough so it was, and we all felt as queer as a first voy'ge pass'nger, the poor young madam 
nigh fainting. All at once it came over us we were being fattened to be killed by the varmint can- 
nibals o' savages, as cared more for man's flesh nor that of a beast. Oh ! my limbs ! the raft was 
as nothing to this here — there was no standing it. The same day in comes a lot o' the men with 
their clubs and spears, looking on us, we thought, as the alderman chaps in London does upon so 
many turtles. The beggars begins feeling our arms and bodies, as the cook aboard might the pigs 
and fowls, while we — Jack and all — half dead with fear, were a wishing we'd been swallowed by 
the sea 'sted o' the savages as seemed a thinking o' it. 

After a bit the savages sits down in the circle, all of us mortally afeard, while poor young madam 
begins crying bitterly. We were all of us, ye see, as we expected soon to be with the can'bals — 
down in the mouih. After a bit in comes Mattee Waboo, the chief as saved us from being killed 
on the raft, along with a boy carrying Jack's fiddle-case, which he puts on the ground, when the 
Mattee pointed to it and wanted us to tell him the use on't— for fortinately, as we larnt afterwards, 
it had been shoved aside as being of no valey, until the chief had overhauled it again, and now 
brought it afore us. 

Honest Jack's face brightened up a bit as he laid hold on his old friend, and as the savages had 
carried off his keys, why he breaks open the case, and takes out his wi-o-lin, as fresh as when he'd 
last put it by, with a long store o' fiddle-strings. When Jack, after ros'ning his bow, began to tune 
a bit, it would have done your hearts good jist to see how the Indees jumped up and got round him. 
But when Jack struck up the " Sailors' Hornpipe," the savages began shouting with pleasure, and 
dancing like mad. Well, the news flew like wildfire, as we a'terwards larnt, that among the 
strangers there was a mighty geolee waukum, or " great spirit." Well, Jack seeing how the wind 



THE MAGIC FIDDLE. 247 

lay, and knowing the ways o' the Indees, wouldn't play without they gave him plenty o' sea room, 
as they got crowding too close agin him. The chiefs soon kept the others ofF, and Jack began a sort 
o' die away, « Wapping Old Slairs/' if I 'member rightly, as made the savages as soft as child's 
milk, until all o' a sudden ho strikes up " Off she goes." Talk of that chap Off-horse, as our book- 
larned bow'son's mate talks o', as made every body follow his music ! — why three years pay to a 
glass o' grog, it warnt any thing like Jack's power over the savages with his wi-o-lin ! 

Well, the chiefs o' the savages, ye see, would never a' been tired o' hearing Jack, but after play- 
ing a couple o' hours. Jack put on a bouncible look, and said as how he'd play no more that day. 
Well, the savages seemed to think Jack a real spirit; they thiowed themselves down on the ground 
and kissed his feet, giving on us to know they'd ccme on the morrow. After the savages had all 
cleared away, we spent a happy night. We had plenty o' yams and" fish and cocoa-nuts sent us, 
and Jack, as he knowed the ways o' the Indees, said there was never a fear of our getting good 
treatment now all along of the fiddle, and if so be we minded our eye, we might get aboard some 
ship as hove in sight. 

Next morning the chiefs and people o' the island came swarming round the hut, all mad to hear 
Jack's fiddle, and when Jack struck up some o' his merry jigs, my eyes ! the creturs seemed half wild 
with the music, as they beat time with their hands and feet. But Jack's great fear was, they'd break 
the fiddle, as many o' them not only put their ears agin it, but wanted to handle it. At last ayoung 
beggar, for'arder nor the others, puts his finger on a string, when Jack, slyly giving the peg a sudden 
hard turn, the boy cried out, as it took the skin off his finger ; at the same minute Jack made the 
violin give a screech, as though it were ahve and wouldn't be meddled with ; a'ter that they larned 
to keep their paws off. 

Well, as I've said, my hearties, the savages had all larned to think Jack a great spirit that was 
come to bless the island, and 'sted o' eating on us, ye see, which the varmints had 'tended, they 
couldn't do too much for us. Now you must know, my hearties, that the king o' the island, as was 
an old man, had been bad for a long time, and died after we'd been on the island about a month, 
arid Jack — the chiefs and the people would have it — was made king o' the island. He had a large 
■wigwam, what they thought a palace, all set round with skulls, to live in, and as how the three other 
hands 'sides myself were made chiefs. Lord ! the crownation was sich a sight !— there was Jack 
playing the fiddle, and all the chiefs and people following, while the Mattaboos, or priests, six old 
chaps, moved a-head. Well Jack, as king, had given him a sort o' breastplate made o' human 
creturs teeth, and a cloak all made o' feathers ; and cause as how by the laws o' the island he must 
many, why he took young madam to be his queen, and they was married after the Indee fashion, 
and so they became man and wife. 

The island, ye see, as we was on was well found in wood and water, and we all thought it must 
have been one o' the Carribees as clustered a lot of them together — for we heard from the savages, 
whose lingo by this time we knowed some'ut of, that there were ten or a dozen o' islands about a 
day's sail off, and that they were at war with the people and font 'em when they met at sea, killing 
and eating the pris'ners as they took, and the other savages doing the like. We larnt also as how 
Mattee doolees, or " great ships," were seed at times by the savages out at sea, and that three small 
craft had put in there the last two moons to get water, the luckee beloes, or " white strangers," 
giving the natives some glass beads, several rows o' which we seed round the necks o' the women. 
Well, ye see, my hearties, if it hadn't been for Jack's wi-o-lin, and his wife as was a real sensible 
queen, he'd a never been able to manage the 'fairs o' state. There was the doole dooes, or "wise men," 
sort o' couns'lor chaps as advises the king — they were all jealous o' each other, and all for diff'rent 
laws — one wanted a chief dead, because as how he liked one o' his wives, and he would't give her 
up — and then another wanted to sail agin another island, and bring home plenty o' pris'ners to eat. 
Jack found it a difficult matter to stop 'em. Well, they soon began to grumble when Jack gave all 
the chiefs for to know he'd have no more human flesh eat, and though he told 'em the " great spirit" 
was angry at sich meat being eaten, and that it warn't good, the varmints patted their belhes, and 
said as how it was shokee gammee, " sweet food." Well, as Jack had made me admiral o' the fleet, 
I had a matter o' twenty canoes under me. I told him if he tried it on, there would be a mutiny ; 
but he would, and I'm blessed if there warn't a rev'lution biought about by that varmint, Maltee 
Wat/boo, the chief as had saved us to get us fattened for eating ; and the people having got used by 
this time to the fiddle, didn't care so much about it, and nigh half on 'em, we heard say, were for 
killing Jack and the stranger chiefs, as they called us, and shoving others in our places. Well, Jack 
and all on us managed to weather the storm for a bit, while we kept a sharp look-out for a sail at sea. 

Luckily for us there was one savage, a pictur o' a cretui for honesty, called Natty Goo ,■ he was 
a rig'lar warrior, could jump like a monkey, and run like a deer, and never missed with the bow and 
airow. Natty had managed, being a handy savage, to make some capital spear-heads out o' some 
old iron he'd got, and one o' the " wise men" as were sort o' judges, mind ye, in the island, went 
into his hut one day and tried to prig a couple o' spear-tops. Natty seed him, and axed him to give 
'em up. The wise man, as was a fool, struck him, and Natty knocked him down. The dook doo 
had him brought before him, and was going to have poor Natty skivered, when King Jack, who had 
larn't the rights of it, wouldn't let him be touched ; ever since which sarcumstance poor Natty, 
vol.. v. — so. T. 1

wos a.poong luong, or little chief, did all he could to sarve us, and told us o' the mut'ny going 
for'ard. Howsomdevei King Jack, as had a taste for gov'nment like, kept it off" by making the chiefs 
quariel with one another, which you must know, my hearties, is the way we keeps out a v/ar in old 
England. That night we larn't they were a-hatching a plot. 

Luckily for us, in the morning, a saicumstance happened as turned out most fort'nate for us all. 
King Jack, I, and the three hands, as had escaped with us from the wreck, had turned out at day- 
light along with Natty and three or four chiefs as was staunch, when on getting to the side o' the 
hill looking over the bay, I'm blessed if we didn't see a small schooner at anchor 'bout half-a-mile 
from the land. As soon as we clapped eyes on the clipper, my limbs! we knowed her in a minute 
from her sharp cut, tap'ring spars, as well as from the broad yellow streak just above her water-mark, 
for the rascally craft as had looked on and then left us on the wreck to the mercy o' the fishes. Ye 
see we were taken all aback at first, and our hearts beat with the thoughts o' leaving the cannibals ; 
hut ye see we had our doubts as to the ch'racter o' the schooner ; she was under Spanish colors, and 
her decks as we had seed her last, was full o' people, while Jack, as seed unkimmonly far, said he 
thought she had some'ut like a long torn amidship. Presently we seed some o' the hands busy 
in shoving some things into the boat astarn, when about a dozen of her crew jumped into her and 
pulled for the bay. They were coming ashore, and Jack, ord'ring our three men to keep outo' sight 
in Natty's crib, close to the p'lace, takes me down with him to see what we could make out o' the 
strangers, telling me to say nothing about our wreck, or having seed the schooner afore, but do jist 
as he did. 

When we'd got down to the bay we seed a lot o' the savages as had come down to swop with 
the strangers. They were the wildest looking set o' bloody cut-throats I ever seed as they stepped 
ashore — whites and Creoles, their beaid growing all over their faces, and wearing red silk caps, while 
many o' their slops was bedizened with gold and silver lace ; then, beside the cutlash each man 
cairied 'longside, there were a matter o' two or three hiace o' pistols hanging by so many lanyards 
round 'em, and to these there were one or two murd'rous long knives stuck in a red sash as they all 
wore. In a minute King Jack and I knowed 'era to be shirks o' pirates, so he minded to keep our 
weather-eye open. " If we could only capture the schooner, what a thing it would be," says Jack. 
" Aye," says I, " it would indeed." " We'll try for it," says he. 

As soon as the savages seed King Jack, they all made way ; and the pirates as was giving away 
a few nails and sich like 'mong the savages, as soon as they seed Jack, took him for a great chief, 
and a big fellow with an old cutlash-slash across his ugly mug that had given one eye a squint, and 
who seemed the skipper, was beginning to make signs to King Jack that he wanted fresh water, 
pointing to a couple o' casks in the boat. 

" Hurrah! my heaities, you're welcome as much as ye like," sung out Jack. 
" Hallo !" says the pirates together in a breath, '-how's thisl — English on a savage island !" as 
they drew back quite 'stonished to hear Jack's lingo, while one or two put their hands on their 
pistols. 

" All fair above board, my hearties," says Jack ; •' I'm English like most o' ye, and with this here 
messmate we're the only two as 'scaped out of a South Merikee brig, as was stove on some rocks to 
nor'ard o' the island, and now I've got to be king o' this island — only tell me how I can sarve ye, 
that's all." 

" Well, may I be run up with the yellow flag flying, if you arn't a good'un to say it. The truth 
is, we're in waftt o' water, and may-be a little prog, as we've had a banyan time of it lately, and it 
arn't convenient to put into every port with the flag we carry at times." And the pirate skipper, 
sich he turned out to be, gave a knowing leer, while the other hands, with ablasp'mous oath or two, 
said he was jist right, " Besides," says the squinny-eyed skipper, " we wanted to c'reen and clean 
out the schooner a bit, if as how you could keep the savages quiet ; and as for a few shiners, or a bag 
o' them, only say the word and they're yours, 'long with a passage, if you should want sich a thing, 
to any South 'Merikee port." 

Jack thanked him, and told them they might consider the island belonged to 'em, when they 
seemed mighty pleased, and King Jack, to show his power, ordered the whole o' the savages away, 
as the pirates seemed wary o' them. But as soon as they seed them all fly at Jack's lingo, they 
'greed to walk up to Jack's palace, by the way aiiing us about our ship as was wrecked. Jack spin- 
ning them a yarn not quite so true as this here ray hearties. Besides this, Jack as much as told the 
pirate he considered a. free trader as a likely craft, and would like to have a beith aboard the schooner. 
When the skipper heard Jack say this, he gripped his fin, told him of a lot o' prizes they'd took, 
and as how they'd murdered all hands, that the schooner was half filled with silver, and what a jolly 
life they had of it. 

As soon as they got up to King Jack's p'lace, ye see, the {urates were half afeard when they seed 
the white skulls all round the crib; but Jack soon told 'em they'd belonged to prisoners afore his 
time. Well, Jack takes 'em into the largest cabin in the house, where he leaves them a minute 
along with me, while he goes to tell his wife what might chance to turn up for all hands. 

Back Jack comes, and as the pirateshad brought plenty o' rum, they all began lushing likegood'uns, 
and Jack and I was a hoping they'd get three sheets in the wind, when we might a mastered them 
with a few hands afore they could a got at their pistols : hut it seemed as though the squinney-eyed 



THE MAGIC FIDDLE. 249 

skipper seemed afeard o' his men getting too much grog aboard, for he got up and a.ved Jack to give 
them a spelf over the island. So taking some o' the chiefs 'long with us for fear o' letting them 
know we intended to cut and run, we made a cruise about the Island, the pirate skipper agreeing to 
take dinner with Jack, and sending olfthe boat for more grog and some junk and biscuit as to help 
to our mess. As Jack gave me to know he wanted to make it night afore he mastered the pirates. 
Well, we kept cruising about the Island, and going into some o' the cribs, where we had enough to 
do to keep the varmints o' pirates from getting into a skrimmage with the people, along of their 
pulling the women about. Well, we managed to make it nigh sun-down afore we got back to Jack's 
crib, and there we found a lot o' victuals all ready spread. After the things were cleared by the 
savages. Jack brings in his fiddle, and the pirates begins singing, dancing, and drmking, like mad 
creturs. Jack's music went to their hearts at once. All the while, ye see, I and Natty, as had been 
up to it, was a-handing the liquor well about, but though the pirates drunk like fishes, it was a long 
time afore they staggered under the liquor, and then they began swearing, horr'ble to hear, and 
saying they'd murder all on the island and have it to themselves. 

When Jack saw how matters went, and that the pirates could scarce manage to stand, he axes 
'em all to join in a health to the black flag. This was the signal, ye see, for our other hands, as 
were thought so many savages, to close round and stand ready. 

" Ay, ay, the black flag for ever ! a heavy cargo and a bloody deck to tell no tales ;" says the 
pirate skipper, and along with his eight men they fills their glasses. 

"Are ye all ready 1" says Jack. 

" Ay, primed and loaded ;" says the pirates, as they stood up, most on 'em holding on by the bench. 

" Then here's the toast, to — ' the True Blue!" sings out Jack, and in a minute the arms of every 
pirate was pinioned by a Indee and tied behind him, helped by our men. In the twinkling o' a 
handspike, we took all their arms, and swore we'd shoot 'em if they stirred, or attempted to sing out. 

" Now tell me, you pirate rascal," says Jack, putting a pistol to the skipper's head, " how many 
hands have you aboard 1" 

The pirate captain, like the others, seemed sobered as it were at once, and begged for marcy, and 
we soon larn't there were but twelve more. 

Jack then tells the skipper he must do as he bids, and come down to the beach with him and us 
Enghsh hands, and hail the schooner to send the boat ashore. 

Untying the pirate skipper's hands, and leaving the pris'ners under Natty's charge along with the 
savages, we took the skipper down to the bay, and made him hail the schooner, which by her bin- 
nacle glim we could see lay about a cable's length offshore, with her anchor a-peak, all ready for a 
start. The schooner heard and answered the skipper's hail to send her boat, and presently we seed 
it making for the creek where we stood. Keeping the skipper for'ard, and swearing we'd blow his 
brains out if he gave the 'larm, the boat had no sooner touched the sand, than two or three of us 
put our pistols to the breasts of the two pirates, and swore we'd shoot 'em if they offered to cry. So 
they thought it better to allow us to take their arms and gag them, when we sent them up pris'ners 
long with the others, still keeping the skipper. They had still ten hands aboard the pirate, and 
there were but four of us, so taking two or three o' our savages, as Jack made lie down in the boat, 
we shoved off. Jack keeping the skipper facing him, with his fins tied in the starn-sheets. When a 
couple o' boats off the low schooner, some o' her watch hailed, and the skipper, with Jack's barker 
at his head, answered. The boat was shoved alongside under her taffrail, and a hand was just 
bringing a glim aft, which showed the pirates lying long the deck, when Jack, follovi'ed by us all, in 
a twinkling jumped aboard. The 'larm was given, but afore they could fire more nor one or two 
shots, as did no damage, they all struck in a jiffy, when we spliced their fins aft, and, with the 
skipper, lowered the beggars into the schooner's hold, while we sent off' the boat for King Jack's 
Queen and the pris'irers, which soon came back with 'em. 

Putting the pris'ners all together, and leaving two of our hands to guard 'em, we found the 
schooner loaded with silver, and gold, and valeybles, and giving three cheers, we weighed anchor, 
and started off — Natty and two o' the savages going along with us, while all the other savages 
ashore were howling like mad, and some on 'em, jumping into their canoes, tried to come up with 
us. What it is to have Prov'dence along with you ! That very night, jist after Jack's wife got 
aboard, a whole lot o' the varmints had gone to kill King Jack and us all ; and when they found as 
how we'd 'scaped, they were like mad. All this Jack had larn't afore, though he said " nothing to 
nobody ;" and now, ye see, through Jack's knowledge and one o' the pirates, as knowed some'ut o' 
navigation, in less nor a week, we ran into Kingston harbor, Jamakee, little as we were, the richest 
craft in the port. Well, the captain o' the bloody " yellow pirate," as was well known thereabouts, 
made a rig'lar stir — the schooner, her cargo, and the pris'ners, were given up to the 'thoiities, as they 
calls 'em ashore, and Jack and all on us got pensions for life, as weregiv'n us by the merchants and 
the gov'ment — Jack getting a hundred pounds a-year, and the others twenty, which I gets to these 
here day. Well, to bring up, you must know, Jack was regularly martied to the gov'nor's daughter — • 
got a sitivation in the Custom-house, through his wife's dad the gov'nor, and now, ye see, has got 
a matter of four or five chips-o'-the-block about him; and if their music arn't as sweet as Jack's, or 
Mr. Splice, as they calls him, now, mayhap, they mayn't ever want it so badly, I'm thinking, as their 
father did 'mong the cannibals, H. J. M.

Iv[- I L T A I &gt;r E . 



I. 



Soul of my joys, Eueda, come away : 
In the cool breath of evening's dewy sighs, 
The parting sun hath steeped his ardent ray, 
The crescent moon high rules the eastern skies : 
Yet cold and pale her beams till thou arise. 
Star of my life, and shine with living light. 
Th' invisible things unveil their starry eyes. 
That dwell on high ineffable and bright, 
Radiant of peace and love to bless the glowing 
night. 



II. 



Here linger we upon the hill awhile, 
And mark the last sad tint of evening fade 
From yon light cloud, that as a fairy isle 
Floats peacefully above the silent glade. 
And see, below, the cypress grove arrayed 
In deeper gloom of closing twilight hour. 
And yon fair tiny bay to slumber laid. 
As a bright infant in its mother's bower, 
While guardian geiiii stern the hills around it 
lower. 



III. 



And ocean's deeper voice is hushed away. 
All save his muttered chidings on the shore 
That cannot cease, tho' with declining day 
Sinks into seeming rest th' eternal roar. 
The plangent deep, shorn of his crested hoar. 
Slow weltering mourns above the sailor's grave. 
Yon baik, a sheeted spectre silvered o'er, 
Seems a calm spirit ruling o'er the wave ; 
While each wild ocean fiend hath sought his pri- 
son cave. 



IV. 



Descend we now, Eueda, to the stream 
Winding unguided thro' the lonely dell. 
Whose dimpled smiles now court the young moon- 
beam 
Down steahng thro' the jealous shade to tell 
The sportive fountain nymph he loves her well ; 
While o'er their joys the insect choirs of night 
Symphonious now, and now responsive, swell 
In ecstasy of musical delight, 
Untaught of future ill, and winter's coming blight. 



V. 



Now rest we here, Vi^here pours the tribute stream 
Upon the bosom of the little bay ; 
And sit, Eueda ; this curved trunk may seem 
A seat for lovers formed. The rising spray 
Glances around the rainbow's various ray, 
While the soft murmur of the falling rill 
Now gently swells, now seems to die away. 
Throbs there a soulless breast so void and chill 
That here at such an hour could feel no rapturous 
thrill 1 



VI. 



Conscious of her high nature, swells the soul 
Forth reaching thro' illimitable space; 
Scorning to dwell beneath ihe clay's control. 
She claims companionship with nature's grace 
And glory — folding in her wide embrace 
Mountains and rivers, lakes, and seas, and skies ; 
Owning in yon bright host a kindred race. 
While fast within the struggling bosom rise 
Thoughts vainly seeking words where all expres- 
sion dies. 

VII. 

By hand unseen the mystic veil withdrawn 
Seems to reveal the shadowy world of fears ; 
Upon the spirit wondrous visions dawn. 
And greetings chill are whispered in the ears, 
Filling the eye with nameless passion's tears. 
Here gentlest things that shun the flaring day 
Have dwelt, perchance, for unremembered years. 
Sporting amid the moonbeam's populous ray, 
And hold these haunted seats till nature's self de- 
cay. 

VIII. 

And here old age hath strangest lore I ween. 
And well believed even yet the goblin tale ; 
Strange deeds were done, and stranger forms were 

seen 
Along this haunted shore and fairy vale. 
Loud shouts of laughter and the voice of wail. 
Mingled with ditties wild but sad to hear, 
At midnight floated oft adown the gale. 
What time our sires for all they held most dear. 
Stood 'gainst their British foes, in peril stem and 

drear. 



THE OUPHE S LOVE. 



251 



IX. 



Such wond'rous talc oft sped the flying hour 
O'er my first childhood, rousing joy and fear, 
When night began in wintry gloom to lower, 
And nature sighed for the departing year ; 
When howl'd the tempest-spirit loud and drear, 
While broad and high the faggots flung their blaze, 
In hearts around awaking nightly cheer, 
Till one loved face would fix the circle's gaze. 
As on his tale .we hung in wonder and amaze. 



X. 



For here, 'tis said, a lonely spirit wooed 

A child of clay with w-ords of witching power ; 

Full oft the maid, to this deep solitude 

Soft stealing from her sleeping sister's bower. 

Would listen, spell-bound, through the midnight 

hour. 
A prince exiled from some bright star on high, 
Now bhght and withered as a stricken flower, 
For crime he scarce might tell of deepest dye. 
Here told of his lost joys with many a hopeless 

sigh. 

XI. 

But listen thou, Eueda ; such the night 
As this, pel chance, and such the chosen scene, 
When that lost Ouphe, in guise of heavenly light, 
Less fallen than man, yet fallen far, I ween. 
Told his sad tale of wo and deadly sin. 
And gentlest, if the lay may teach thee well, 
How such may view th' atonement made between 
God and the human world, 'twere joy to tell 
How from his starry height the erring spirit fell. 

XII. 

Oh ! sweet thy dreams, divinest poesy, 
Thy spiritual fountains pure, exhaustless flowing; 
Thy potent spells deep-fraught of mystery, 
Thy soul-felt joys ecstatic, ever growing, 
Breathe on my soul, thy smile with raptures glow- 
ing. 
Oh ! veil not from thy trembling worshipper ! 
As erst by Chebar's flood, dark mysteries showing, 
The True One led his piophet-minister. 
Clear thou my visual ray, dispel my spirit's fear. 



The storm is fled, 

The winds are dead. 
Heaves ocean still a chastened moan ; 

The moon is bright 

At deep midnight, 
On foam-wreaths by the billows strown. 
The wavelets, o'er the shallow bar, 
Roll up the naiTfow inlet far. 
Till gently as a maiden's breast 
In peace of guiltless beauty's rest, 
Within the little bay serene, 
They noiseless swell and fall unseen. 



Hushed are the breakers on the shore, 

Tho' oft they seem with angry roar 

Striving as fiends to burst away 

The guardian shallows of the bay, 

Its tranquil beauties all to blast, 

As erst their spell on Eden past : 

Tho' scarce perchance ere woman's lightness 

Had sullied primal nature's brightness 

Were Eden's moonlight streams and groves 

So fair a scene for human loves. 



II. 



In fancy's dream 

The whole may seem 
Abode of spirits pure and fair; 

Not more serene 

A fairy scene, 
Nor decked with more of beauty's care. 
With rude toil spent upon the deep 
The wearied tempest here may sleep. 
Caressed by drooping vines that lave 
Their tresses in the swelling wave, 
And soothed by sighings of the breeze 
In dalliance vvfith the whispering trees. 
Guarded from noonday's sultry beam, 
There opes a lovely Indian stream 
Mid ancient cedars, sapling pines, 
Cool cypresses and wild-grape vines ; 
Where oft perchance some lone Chactas 
Hath mourned for his lost Atala. 
Swift stooping to these waters fair 
The wearied passage birds repair 
To rest from their unguided flight, 
'Mid scenes so more than human bright 
They well may deem them strangely new 
To ruthless man's destructive view. 
In other years at summer dawn 
Steered from the brake the peerless swan, 
And seemed a water-queen to ride 
Majestic o'er the conscious tide. 
Fearless of lurking hunters' aim 
The tall stag and the dun roe came, 
Well pleased to bathe at noontide hour, 
And crop the whortle's dainty flower. 
But those have fled, for man has trode 
Too oft of late their calm abode. 

III. 

In gloom above 

The silent grove 
Looks down upon the mimic sea 

With deepening groans 

The sea-drum moans. 
The owl hoots back maliciously : 
While rippling o'er the placid lake 
Is seen the diving otter's wake. 
Well known the foe of malice shrewd, 
The prudent wild duck warns her brood, 
And shadowed in the silver tides, 
Her fairy fleet away she guides. 
A gay wisp-bearer down the glade. 
Comes gleaming from his piny shade :

burton's gentleman's magazine. 



A Hierry goblin sprite, I ween, 

And often in his antics seen, 

Now dancing light his frohc round 

Above the dank and fenny ground ; 

Now wreathing Vv^ildfire sportively 

Thro' bare roots of yon cedar tree. 

The fitful night wind murmuring 

Thro' bent-grass wreathed in wild witch-ring 

Sighs round his home yon rushy spring ; 

"Where hangs above the sea-conch's shell, 

Fit cup to drink of haunted well. 

The hour is come, and this the grove, 

The Ouphe shall meet his mortal love ; 

Heie he hath wooed her oft alone, 

And he hath won her for his own. 

O'er her young heart a spell is cast, 

His power upon hCT soijl hath past. 

O'er sky and flood. 

O'er hill and wood. 
From lattice looks she sad of cheer ; 

With deep-drawn sigh 

Her tearful eye 
Now turns on one loved sleeper near. 
Naught dreaming how that sleepless one 
Hath stolen from her arms and gone. 
For peace to that lorn maiden's breast 
Hath been a transitory guest, 
Yet hap what may, yon gleam afar 
She knows her spirit's meteor car. 
And tho' portentous lowering drear 
Her future with unearthl}^ fear ; 
And tho' of late her wayward life 
Hath been but wildest passion's strife. 
Yet she to-night shall prove anew, 
Joy ! joy ! her spirit-lover true. 
That flushing cheek and glowing eye. 
Speak they ot hope, of rapture nigh ? 
Perchance of more ; a nameless thought 
Within her soul to-night hath wrought. 
And whispered inarticulate 
Low warnings of her changing fate. 
Upon her life's untrodden way 
Hath gleamed one momentary lay, 
Eevealing — but she may not brook 
Upon its darksome wilds to look. 
For pity ! it vi^ere sad to see 
The ways of spell-wrought phantasy. 



V. 



A rising star 

May seem afar 
Yon gleam upon the ocean wave. 

That fain would steep 

In the southern deep 
Its blow the billows swell to lave. 
I know not if the tale be true, 
'Tis said that wond'rous meteor threw 
On wave and wood, on hill and stream, 
O'er nature round so wild a gleam. 
That staitled sleepers woke to gaze 
Upon its orb in dread amaze, 



And deemed the day of final doom 
For man's apostate race had come. 
Deep glowed the spectre — near, more near ,' 
The very brook grew hush with fear. 
The wild duck greeted loud the day. 
The prowling musk-rat dived away. 
The whip-poor-will's half-uttered note 
Died in the scared night-waibler's throat. 
The timid roe forgot her fawn 
And fled from such a luiid dawn. 
One moment o'er the lake it stood. 
Pouring its beams o'ei wave and wood ; 
Then as the lightning's jagged form 
Evanishes amid the storm, 
Night sunk around upon the scene. 
And the wan moon looked forth again. 



VI. 



Nor aught afraid 

Yon timid maid ; 
Her eye hath caught a wilder gleam ; 

The spectre light 

That gilds the night 
Should quail before its ardent beam. 
Her spirit's love-notes deep and clear — 
Have they not reached her wakeful ear"? 
Vain thought ! Can spring forget her flowers, 
Or plants not crave their summer showers] 
Bid spectres leave their native glooms ; 
Life, beauty, health, usurp the tombs. 
Let withering frost the rose-bud swell. 
And night and day together dwell ; 
But bid not woman smile or sleep 
When love hath bid her watch or weep. 
She hears, and to her thought they seem 
The music of a blissful dream. 

VII. 

" At the mystical stieams 

Of Nilus afar, 
I rose on the beams 

Of a meteor star. 
Thro' night's habitations 

Careei ing I blazed ; 
I paled the dark nations. 

They trembled amazed. 
The sailor looked forth 

On ihe fire of my train; 
From the south to the north, 

It enkindled the main. 
The viewless of earth, . 

The spirits of night. 
From sorrow or mirth, 

All ceased at my flight. 
Fair mortal, the stars 

Have veiled their pure sheen ; 
Their silvery cars 

Are rolling unseen. 
The high moon is keeping 

Night-watch in her tower ; 
Bright dews are beweeping 

Each delicate flower. 



THE OUPHES LOVE. 



253 



Come forth to thy lover, 
Fear naught tlie lone hour; 

Each goblin night rover 
Hath fled from my power." 

VIII. 

Oh ! pale for fear 

Were men to hear 
That voice in many a distant dwelling ; 

The life-blood froze, 

As wild it rose, 
Afar up thro' the still night swelling. 
At first they deemed that it might be 
The plover from the sedgy lea ; 
Or lone curlew's despairing cry, 
Left bleeding on the shore to die. 
And some — the thought was banished soon- 
Might hold it note of water-loon. 
But soon they knew — prolonged and shrill, 
Arousing terror's deepest thrill — 
'Twas naught of nature's common bij-th. 
Nor uttered by a child of earth : 
And cowering in his lonely bed, 
Each listener veiled his trembhng head. 



IX. 



Why lingers tjiere 

That maiden fair, 
V^ith heaving breast and tearful eye? 

On yon bay shore 

She oft before 
Hath eager met love's signal cry. 
'Tis' strange it will not from her brain, 
The thought she may not meet again 
Her, free of passion's storm}' pov\'er, 
ViAho knows not sleepless midnight hour. 
One kiss — another — can she leave 
Her thus to wake alone and grieve 1 
Their budding loves in childhood growing, 
AfToction's streams together flowing. 
Their spirits breathing still in one — 
Oh ! can she leave her now alone 1 
The mingled prayer at evening hour 
Low uttered ia their peaceful bower. 
Her sweet good-night, her last caress. 
So full of love and gentleness — 
And who shall cheer her loneliness? 
Upon the sleeper's cheek there fell 
One tear-drop, passion's mute farewell, 
And woke th' unconscious murmured sighs- 
Noiseless away the maiden hies. 



X. 



O'er moss and stone 

She flies alone, 
'Mid silence of the deep midnight; 

Thro' glancing shade 

Is seen the maid, 
A spirit of the pale moonlight. 
The hill, the woodland stream is past, 
And she hath won the grove at last, 



And stills her heart's quick throb to hear. 
The falling rill low murmurs near. 
Hath some false meteor gleamed above 1 
Hath some wood-note beguiled her love 1 
Or spirit of some unknown race 
For ill to her sought that lone place 1 
Away the thought I his thrilling voice 
Again hath bid her heart rejoice; 
That eye's full orb so deep and bright^ 
Hath beamed on her its starry lighl. 
And what to thee, lost maid, are worth 
All hopes, all soulless joys of earth 1 

XL 

The conscious trees 

Without a breeze 
Vv'aved sighing o'er the maiden's head ; 

The waters wailed, 

The sad moon paled, 
The stars looked forth all wan with dread. 
Age after age of fleeting time, 
Eeplete with loves and woes and crime. 
Torn from the future's pregnant vast. 
Had slumbered with the dreamless past.- 
And sad those dewy orbs had seen. 
Their sister-planet's faded sheen. 
But never since from native heiaven 
Those wayward ones to ruin given, 
By mortal maid's enchantment held, 
Wrought strange new sin in days of eld,. 
Had moon or stars or ancient sun 
Such loves of beauty looked upon. 
All vainly may the artist try 
To catch the light of woman's eye, 
Ev'n when untouched of love serene 
She moves in grace a conscious queen.. 
Yet mark, when first those orbs express- 
The light of passion's tenderness, 
The hand forgets its wonted skill. 
The trembling heart but knows to feel. 
And scarce that spirit dares to prove 
How strong the spell of woman's love. 
And he — no human guise he wears, 
It is no human form he bears, 
Such as in manly grace arrayed 
May court the dreams of blushing maid;. 
But all ineffable, so bright, 
He looks a child of sinless light. 

XII. 

But sad his brow 

And gloomy now. 
Deep fraught with restlessness of wo ^ 

Where mildness grew 

A wildness new 
Is in that eye's dilated glow. 
Unknown, the maiden's heart to bless, 
He came in seeming gentleness ; 
But dreams she not that by her side 
A fierce fiend woos her for his bride 1 
And is there nought of fearfulness 
In that wild spirit-thing's caress 1

Ah ! well she knows her all his own ; 
Her spirit to his love hath grown ; 
And were he of the outcast crew 
To their Creator erst untrue, 
So deep the spell — whate'er await 
Her love, she may not shun her fate. 
Yet hath she often paused to dare 
The meeting with her unknown there, 
And sometimes vowed no more to try 
The gaze of his deep fearful eye ; 
But now it turns so mild on her. 
So gentle — nay, she cannot fear. 
Tho' swelling fast, she knows not why, 
Swift tears are glancing from her eye, 
While pouis that spirit-voice scarce heard 
Faint inusical each breathing woid, 
As thro' the nerves and quickened sense 
Flows summer eve's sweet influence. 
She feels his kindling thoughts that roll 
Ecstatic thro' her passive soul. 

XIII. 

" Mortal of birth, 

Fair child of ctirth, 
I would not stay thy passion's tears, 

If boded ill 

Thy bosom chill 
With future sorrow's herald fears. 
Weep, thou that cans't ; 3'ou mortals say 
Tears take wo's keenest stings away. 
It may be so, for I have seen 
The young bough crushed when full and green 
Weep some few drops, then as it grew 
At first swell out with life anew ; 
But dry lea^'es torn to swift decay 
Are borne by wanton winds away. 
ISot vainly, maiden, o'er thj' heart 
This sadness comes — to-night, we part. 
Nay — hear — my tale, untold before, 
Tho' long in act shall soon be o'er, 
For night wanes on, and I must be 
Ere dawn beyond the Indian sea. 

XIV. 

" Maiden, afar, 

Above yon star 
That paly gleams upon the night, 

Long ere this earth 

Found happy birth. 
We held ethereal woilds of light: 
All withered now, and dark and drear, 
Yet still, my native orb, still dear, 
Tho' faded from thy joyous light. 
Dry w.'t.h sin's curse and hopeless blight. 
To sec thee ev'n in thy lost state 
Would soothe my own unhappy fate.

By many an orb and central sun. 
Should see innumerous in the skies, 
System on system beaming rise, 
For ages as ye count them here, 
Eie he could reach our darkened sphere, 



Once fresh with life and happiness — 
Nor dreamed we they could e'er be less 

XV. 

" In sinless joy 

Of blest employ 
Secure we long in peace abode ; 

Our chief delight 

To do aright 
His high commands and worship God. 
Free of the universe to trace 
The wonders of extended space ; 
Wide thro' creation's empire vast. 
From world to distant world we passed ; 
Grew intimate with things on high ; 
The spirit-realms of mystery ; 
Scanned their deep policies of state, 
And read each ancient system's date : 
Skirted the bounds of night afar, 
Where glimmers many a lonely star. 
Pale centinels they stand on guard. 
And keep o'er Chaos ceaseless ward. 
An aj,"e were scarce enough to tell 
What things in yonder regions dwell 
Of wondrous beauty pure and tiue, 
Unswerving from allegiance due, 
Serene of joy they still adore 
In forms as fair as erst we bore. 

XVI. 

" From star to star 

In sounding car 
Glad rumor tireless long had sped, 

That worlds of life 

And beauty rife 
Should rise in space untenanted. 
And from their distant spheres of light, 
Where brooded first creative might, 
Long time had poured thro' realms of air, 
The countless spirit-nations there. 
With other tribes to see, adore, 
Thither our curious legions bore ; 
Wo to the hour ! and sin's black weed 
Veil up that day's unhappy deed. 
When all untouched of crime and woes, 
From Chaos first your planets rose ; 
When upward from th' abysm whirled 
Your sun with each attendant world 
Rolled out and took his central stand 
In middle space by new command ; 
When first in joy each young orb sped, 
In light piolific on it shed. 
And youthful order's reign began. 
Strange wonder thro' the heavens ran. 
And full and far when first rung out 
From that assembled host the shout, 
With those who share our penal woes 
My seeming joyous voice arose. 
Free burst the hymn of praise we sang, 
Free thro' the listening heavens it rang; 
Reverberate from star to star 
It shook their mighty arches fai.

Bent from his awful throne to hear.

'•■ Earth's human lord 

In peace adored 
Of nature in descending grades, 

Immortal then 

The sire of men 
I saw in lovely Eden's shades. 
Unconscious of his future crime, 
Tho' child of clay he stood sublime, 
With one pure creature fair as thou — 
In thee I see her, maiden, now — 
Complete in bliss and formed to prove 
The highest ecstasies of love ; 
Of intellect serene and high, 
With form of grace and symmetry, 
Wrought strangely into harmony. 
Ye hold the clay-formed body iiaught 
But clog of happiness and thought; 
And such it is with ill now blent, 
Perverted from its first intent 
To raise vile passions in the soul ; 
Yet blindly scorn her right control : 
Not always thus ; sad change hath been 
Upon it wrought, the change of sin. 
Rich source of good, refined of sense. 
The soul confessed its excellence, 
And found in its renewed employ 
Unfailing fruitfulness of joy.

Ere full the age of earth be sped. 
Of import high, and darker still. 
The sad mysterious birth of ill. 
Whence it could come, or how arise 
To blight us in our native skies ; 
And whence its awful power could be 
To tear from ancient fealty 
The innumerous high archangel host 
Now in the pit of darkness lost; 
And why it last should enter here 
To desolate this happy sphere — 
Why suffered in His works to dwell, » 
I know not, mortal — none can tell. 
Thus much ; as from their native heaven 
In maddening rout and ruin driven, 
That host fled downwards in despair, 
They passed our seats of upper air, 
Anrl, leagued with them, our rebel powers 
Were driven from their peaceful bowers.

Why with the fiends we dared rebel ; 
Upon us all destruction vast, 
Ruin and desolation past. 
A cloud sunk down upon my brain. 
Nor yet hath left it clear again. 
Thus much — the blackest guilt they bore

And outcast from their seats of bliss,

In soul as in birth 
All kindred together shall raise,

Oh ! think, if to our race could come

Bearing the guilt and anguish due 
From the affronted law to you.

From man to God a new access ; 
From heaven's high battlements amazed.

And I must leave thee — nay, at best. 
My being nought can know of rest. 
And thou — so rich a heart is thine, 
I would not link its fate with mine. 
'Tis true, I wander here alone, 
Noi kindred in my race have known : 
Nor sought, as men do in distress. 
Companionship of wretchedness ; 
Nor fiend-like plotted to destroy 
The vestiges of human joy. 
No — if the blight, the curse of ill, 
Have been for ages, shall be still. 
Upon my being iold and drear. 
In barrenness of hope and fear. 
Fallen I am not yet so far 
As joy another's peace to mar. 
Till memory of that bliss divine,

Who dreamed not till thy beauty on 
His loneliness of sorrow shone 
That aught so fair as thou to see 
In his dark banishment could be. 
I heard thy spirit ask for one 
To love and to be loved alone ; 
To share affection's deepest thrill, 
And thy large depths of soul to fill. 
We met ; thy sweetest words to hear, 
To feel thy love, to know thee near — 
To see thy heart's pure gorgeousness. 
But most thy gentleness to bless, 
Have been some respite of my wo ; 
That little dream fled by, I go 
Alone that thou may'st cease to be 
Companion of my misery. 
Nor prove how blight the curse within, 
My life, the withering curse of sin." 

XXVL 

" Thine only evei, 

Nought shall sever 
My soul from thee, whate'er thou art ; 

Thine, only thine. 

Thy woes be mine, 
Light hast thou deemed of woman's heart ; 
I know not of thy guilty state, 
I reck not of thy hopeless fate, 
Nor shrink I with my woman's dread 
From storms of wrath upon thy head. 
Three summer moons not yet have flown 
Since nought of passion I had known ; 
And tho' at times a passing sadness 
Came o'er my bosom's wonted gladness, 
Joy sped the winged hours along. 
That warbled with ray blissful song. 
As otheis then a timid maid, 
I feared to tread the twilight glade. 
Deep change hath passed upon me now, 
And I can meet as firm as thou 
Thy strongest wo, thy worst of fate. 
Nor bare my soul all desolate. 
For I will hope ; none, none could see 
When fell our human parent free. 
And closed the doom of sin's despair. 
How beam of hope could enter there. 
Yet rescue came ; and ceaseless free 
My prayers shall be to HIM for thee, 
Till Mercy find new means of grace 
For thee and thy repentant race ; 
And to his native joys restore 
The Ouphe, to sin and fall no more." 

XXVII. 

In sable shroud 

Of stormy cloud 
Deep veiled the moon her waning light ; 

While fierce and fast 

Rode on the blast. 
The storm-king thro' his realms of night. 



The thunder roared as a fiend in pain, 
The startled waves rose from the main. 
Deep bayed the wolf-hound long and drear^ 
The red fox couched him down in fear ; 
Out screamed the heron from the marsh, 
The big horn-owl laughed loud and harsh. 

The storm is fled. 

The winds are dead. 
Bright comes the red dawn o'er the deep ; 

With terror pale 

And voice of wail 
The lost maid's kindred wake to weep.. 



I. 



Hushed is the lay ; its failing echo dies ; 
Fades on my sight the vision's fleeting ray ; 
Dissolved the spell that charmed my raptured eyes 
With thy dear presence, while my little lay 
I poured to thee, Eueda, far away. 
And was it then the phantom of a dream, 
Blight as a spirit of celestial day. 
That traced with me the dell and moonlight stream? 
With listening smile and eyes of strong but kind- 
ly beam 1 



II. 



Yes it was all a dream ; as most I feared 
When most it seemed divine. As comes the dawn. 
To shipwrecked mariner, its light appeared — 
When horrors of the lingering night are gone — 
Radiant of hope, till sterner reason shone 
O'er the drear, trackless waste of wintry years. 
Oh ! could it but remain — could I dream on 
For ever, light were earthly hopes and fears. 
Scarce worth an infant's smiles or transitory tears,, 



III. 



Weary and sad amid my native bowers, 
With no kind heart to beat reply to mine, 
I did but seek to drive the lagging hours 
With minstrel-rhyme, when to my thought divine,, 
Tho' scarce its heavenly grace might equal thine^. 
The fair phantasma came : less lonely grew 
My spirit while its beauty seemed to shine ; 
In perspective my errant fancy drew 
Transporting joys of hope — all faded from mj 
view. 



IV. 



These skies are fair, they say : the moon is bright^ 
The brook's low-murmuring minstrelsy is stealing 
Thro' nature's senses blandly, and the night 
And stars their deep symphonious voices pealingy. 
Strong gushing fountains of the heart unsealing,. 
To other eyes they seem all loveliness. 
To other hearts deep-fraught of rapturous feeling... 
The spell dissolved that gave them power to bless^ 
To me they bring but sense of deeper loneliness.

I've beheld you laid aside ; 

Love and hate forgot ; 
Fame, ambition, glory, power, 
You I've seen enjoy your hour. 
Beauty, withering', as a flower, 

While I altered not I 

When I"ve been from age to age, 
Questioned by the lettered sage, 

What a star might be, 
I've answered not; for soon, I knew, 
He'd have a clearer, nobler view, 
And look the world of mysteries through, 

In vast eternity ! 

The Star— by Miss Gould. 



MuTABiLiTi and decay are written upon all earthly objects. The physical world around us is 
doomed to inevitable change. The productions of nature — the deeply rooted and widely spreading 
forest tree, and the tender rose-leaf that yields to the soft breath of the zephyr, alike must wither and 
commingle with their mother earth. The creations of art — the statue to which the sculptor has im- 
parted all but life, the towering monuments with which architecture would hand down to posterity 
fondly cherished names, must follow in the wake of all that earth owns. The car of time, as it has 
come rumbling down the pathway of the past, has swept over the enchanting garden of Eden, and 
crushed the beautiful flowers that regaled, with their loveliness and perfume, the first inhabitants of 
that blissful spot. Its wheels have rubbed against the pyramids themselves, and the mason-work of 
those proud structures must fall into the embrace of the vulgar soil around it. Old father Time, 
with his iv}^ wand, has pointed to the mighty fabrics upon which Eternal has been written, as 
though to mock his power, and Desolation, following in his train, has subscribed — mine/ 

Not only does the world around us hasten to its consummation, but we find that our own bodies, 
too, — these pampered, cherished frames of ours, — must lie in the dust, and satiate the appetite of the 
filthy worm. We see our fellow men around us daily dying ; at every vibration of the clock's pen- 
dulum, one life is extinguished, one soul departs. We have become so familiar with death in all its 
forms, that we follow a fellow being to his last, long home, with almost as little sensation as we dis- 
pose of a blasted tree, or lay a child to sleep in its cradle. Indeed, it is considered an affected senti- 
mentality that sighs over the decay of human grandeur and the shortness of human life. 

But although there is no certain stay to the things of this world, yet there are objects in creation 
to which time imparts no perceptible decay. ^When the human eye becomes tired with looking upon 
the mutable things of this world, it can direct its gaze to those orbs of enduring brilliance which 
glitter in the diadem of night. It can wing its way through the great inane to those mighty orbs 
4hat float in grandeur through the immeasurable sea of space, and follow in the concatenation of 
planets, and suns, and systems, that lead to the throne of their unoriginated Creator. It is a glori- 
ous thought that He whose word spake the universe into existence, is the author of our being — that 
He whose power sustains the mighty vault, whose wisdom points out the pathway of the myriads 
of seen and unseen worlds that throng the heavens, and regulates the unbroken music of those eter- 
nal spheres, is the God from whose munificent hands we receive all the blessings which we enjoy ! 

And they never change ! The same unstained sisterhood that gathered around the cradle of our 
new-born earth, and in their heavenly minstrelsy chaunted her natal song, still hold their untired 
vigils around her. When " our first sire in Eden woke to life," and his eyes were unsealed to be- 
hold the lovely face of nature wreathed with the smiles of her infant existence, and the sight of the 
glorious flames that burn upon the dome of Nature's palace, burst on his enraptured vision, he was 
greeted by the same rays that will fall upon his posterity to the latest generation. When the im- 
mense cloud that curtained the heavens for forty days and forty nights, from whose unfailing sources 
issued the mighty rains that purged a polluted world, and from whose dark bosom leaped the thun- 
derbolts of an indignant God, was rolled away, — when Noah from his prison-house looked out upon 
the face of heaven, and the bright stars looked still brighter from their temporary concealment, he 
saw the same luminaries which nightly salute our eyes in undiminished glory. 

Not only are they worthy of consideration in themselves, but associations of the most interesting

kind cast their charms around them. How many a tearful, sorrowful eye has bent its gaze upward 
to the starry expanse, and seemed to draw from its hallowed gentleness a consolation for the broken 
spirit! Grief — deep, intense, coiroding grief — cannot be allayed by the multiplication of words. 
But when the cloud of sorrow lowers darkly on the heart, let it survey the boundless creation of om- 
nipotent energy, and know that the sustainer of the universe delights to do his creatures good. Have 
you met with a being, in your intercourse with your fellow creatures, whom you supposed to be the 
personification of perfection — whose heart you thought was the very shrine of purity ] And have 
you found that the supposed perfection was the deceitful garb of hypocrisy — that the supposed pu- 
rity was hidden guile — and that your confidence was betrayed! Then pour foith your complaints 
to the silent stars — they are not fickle ; they smile not one moment, and frown the next I You have 
loved, perhaps, — certainly you have, for to love is to live, — not with that youthful, impetuous pas- 
sion, which, in the words of the poet, " blinds the eye and rules the heart," but with that steady 
stream of affectionate friendship which is " sweeter than life, and stronger than death." And per- 
haps you have seen the object of your fondest solicitude pine away under the influence of disease — 
the eyes that beamed sentiments which the tongue never can express, have become dim in death, and 
in return for the last, warm kiss of love, the chilliness of the inanimate lips has sent the keen pang 
of cold despair to your heart. How soothing then to look upon the stars, and think that the idol of 
your affections may be traversing the plains of a particular orb whose exceeding brilliancy attracts 
your attention. 

For myself — I cannot subscribe to the doctrine which teaches that the whole universe will be an- 
nihilated by the catastrophe which displaces this almost insignificant globula from its orbit. I can- 
not persuade myself that when this atom shall be dashed from the majestic temple of creation, that 
the mighty pillars which support the stupendous fabris^will crumble, and leave it a dismantled ruin 
in the desolate desert of space ; nor do I believe that the thunder which shall rend and disjoin the 
foundations of the earth, will shake another gem from the crown of omnipotent glory. I would not 
wish to believe that destruction will ever overtake the cheerful companions of many a tedious hour 
of sickness, whose beams have struggled through the casement, and beguiled my weary midnight 
moments, when sleep had taken possession of my affectionate attendant, and Disease kept her un- 
tiring vigils by my bed-side ; while flushed Fever glared fearfully upon me with her bloodshot eyes, 
and Death hovered with his scythe about the most lovely and blooming hopes of my heart. Oh, 
no ! — if ever I be so happy as to out-ride the billows of Life's tempestuous ocean — to come unsear- 
ed out of the fire of scorn and contumely, and hatred and calum.ny — I hope to spend my eternity in 
visiting the troops of stars that stand like sentinels around the august palace of Jehovah. And when 
I shall have heard all that may be known of His power, and wisdom, and goodness, and glory — 
when my unfettered mind shall swell with the immensity of its own conceptions — to be let into the 
immediate presence of the Godhead's dazzling splendor, and plunge into the unfathomed ocean of 
infinite mind. C. M. F. D.

The bieezes fan my biow, 
And softly round me play; 

They're pathless and unchained- 
Would I were free as they ! 

The waters at my feet 
Go murmuring along — 

Oh, would my life could glide 
In such untroubled song ! 

And o'er my aching head 
The fleecy cloudlets float ; 

And, as they flit along, 
My vanished joys denote ; 



Light, as the breast that felt them- 
False, as the love she gave — 

Changing, as heart of woman — 
And fleeting as the wave ! 

Far on yon mountain-top 
There is a wreath of snow ; 

And on its breast the sun 

Pours forth his crimson glow ; 

But all in vain his rays 
With torrid lustre dart — 

So fall the pleasures of this world 
Upon my frozen heart ! 



THE FAIR MAID OF F A L A I S E 



A SKETCH FROM HISTORY. 



B T E . Vr . ?r , 



Dat was flinging from his wearied pinions the last and loveliest rays of light ere he left the 
woods and vales of Normandy for a time to darkness, as a gallant party of mounted hunters swept 
through the streets of Falaise towards the castle of the duke. The trampling of their steeds, the 
ringing of stiirup and bit, the loud echo of the laugh and the jest startled into attention the silent 
street. The child stopped in its gamboUingf — the old man, the matron, and the maiden forsook their 
avocations to gaze at the stining sight. The array swept on, and was lost behind the wooded un- 
dulations that separated the castle from the town. 

When the sound of the last hoof-stroke had died away, and the last glimpse had been caught of 
the dancing caps and waving scarfs, the little urchin got astride of his stick, and pranced and cur- 
vetted in joyful anticipation of the day when he should draw the rein and wield the sword in the 
train of some lordly master; — the old man returned to the instrument of husbandry he had been 
rudely fashioning, the matron to her househould occupation ; the one to tell, and the other to listen 
to exploits of years when hairs, now silvered with age, curled dark as the raven's crest, and nerves, 
now tremulous and unfaithful, were strong and true as steel : — the maiden came back with a deepen- 
ed color on her cheek, and a brighter glance in her laughing eye, for she had caught a look, per- 
chance a smile, from one of those bold servitors that may feed her fancy until the nest stolen meet- 
ing beneath the waving grove, or by the vineyard's side. 

But there was one who still lingered at her cottage door, leaning over the arbor-like tiellis work, 
her form half-hidden by the clustering vine. Her eye followed not the path the cavalcade had taken, 
but was shaded by the long drooping lash, while the curl of her beautiful lip, the petulant stamp of 
her little foot, and the rending to the very libres of the vine-leaf in her hands, told of some disap- 
pointment that was but illy borne. Thus entranced in the magic of her own all-absorbing thoughts, 
she heeded not that the sun's last glance had smiled and faded on the castle's highest tower, and that 
the broad full moon was flooding earth and sky with her softened radiance, while the " golden torch 
of sea-born Venus," as Bion styled that loveliest and purest of heaven's orbs, was gleaming like a 
diamond on the brow of night. Many a leaf and twming tendril had been plucked from its parent 
stem to fall in shreds at her feet, while its place was supplied by another and still another to suflfer 
the same unheeded fate, when the sound of a step upon the very threshhold caused her to start from 
her trance and bound gaily forward from her leafy screen ; but how gladly would she have sought its 
covert again to hide the burning blushes that glowed upon her throbbing brow, had not her trembling 
limbs forbidden the contemplated flight, while her faithless tongue scarce allowed her to falter 
forth— 

" I had hoped it was my father, returning from his labor in the valley." 

The intruder hesitated not to spring lightly to the maiden's side, and clasping one hand within 
his own to place his other arm around her slender waist, as half-fearful of her vanishing, or half play- 
fully to support her. 

" Had hoped, Louise," he exclaimed reproachfully — " am I then unwelcome as unexpected 1 
Methinks, after the toil I have undergone to bask me once more in the light of those eyes, so cold a 
reception is undeserved. Nay, coy one," he added, as Louise quietly disengaged her form from his 
encircling arm, " you do not entirely escape me," and he tightened with a gentle pressure his grasp 
upon her hand. 

But Louise had recovered from the momentary embarrassment occasioned by surprise mingled 
with some wilder emotions, and there was a playfulness in her tones as evading a reply to the re- 
proach implied in his question, she said — 

" I looked for you among the duke's hunters as they galloped by here about sunset, but your 
steed led them not as was wont — your eye glanced not as usual from the front of the gallant array, 
and my busy fancy whispered me that Robert had forgotten his cottage bird and was bowing at the 
foot-stool of some high-born lady at the French or English court." 



THE FAIR MAID OF FALAISE. 26 1 

blissful day dreams that cheered her loneliness, while, mingled with every thought, came the vision 
of that mild old man, whose voice never met her ear s^ive in tones of kindness, whose eye dimmed 
■with labor and fatigue grew bright and smiled at her affectionate caresses — that voice alas ! now 
hushed, and that eye closed in death. She bowed her head to shut out the scene fiom her view, and 
that tear-drop driven from its resting place by a dozen others, fell npon the face of a lovely infant, 
that was slumbering softly at her feet. The little sleepet opened its eyes and laughed ; in a moment 
the mother reigned supreme in her soul, drowning, in the full swell of its emotions, every other feel- 
ing and passion. It was a busy night throughout the castle. The vassals hastened to and fro in 
the court and the antechambers, some with viands for the banquet, others with goblets of the grape's 
ruddy juice, while here and there was a group preparing spear and sword, burnishing the aimor, and 
Conversing upon the strange occurrence of their lord's departure, in the grand hall was the glare of 
lights, the noise of revehy, the clank of the wine flagon, the chorussed song, and the applauded 
jest ; — there Robert, the magnificent, or, as he was sometimes called, the devil, feasted high with his 
retainers, for the morrow's sun he had vowed should see him oir his pilgrimage towards the Holy 
Land. As these mingled sounds rose faintly to Louise's ear she clasped her child to her bosom, 
"whom, struggling to escape the tears that fell fast and burning on his cheek, she soothed with a low 
and plaintive song, which floated round that turret chamber, soft yet melancholy as the silvery dip 
of the oar, when it breaks with a regular cadence the moonlit wave, 

" Hush, my babe, hrash — dost tViou hear not the neigh 
Of steed that impatient awaitelh the day 1 
See'st not yon barque that rides idly the, foam 
Chiding the pilgrim who loiters at home ? 
That steed and that barque are bound for the land 
Where the scimitar gleams in each pagan hand, 
Where pale crescents shine from dark folds that wave 
O'er infidel Emir and treacherous slave. 

Who shall at daybreak that chafing steed ride 1 
What pilgrim doth yon idle vessel abide 1 
His foot in the stirrup, his grasp on the rein. 
And wind-shod they sweep over valley and plain ; 
His step on the deck, his voice in command, 
And the sails of that barque like pinions expand. 
The slender masts bend, thro' billows they plough — 
Heaven shield that brave pilgrim — he's lost to us now. 

My heart feels — and oh ! how that feeling doth burn ! 

The barque of that pilgrim will never return, 

His brow will be blanched by the desert wind's breath, 

Or plague spots declare the dread angel of death, 

And my soul will droop helpless, crush'd, withered, and broke, 

Like tender vine torn from the stem of the oak, 

Which its heart-strings embraced — but thou, my babe, thou 

Above all shall be honored — for thus did he vow." 

■i. 

" And he comes at this moment to fulfil that vow" — she started at the well known voice, brushed 
away the remaining tear?, and smiled, though faintly and sadly. The dukehad entered unperceived, 
and now stood by her side, his face flushed, his eye wildly bright, and his whole demeanor betraying 
far more of the reckless reveller than of the humble pilgrim. 

" Again in tears, Louise ; — why will you entertain these sorrowful forbcdings 1 Believe me, it is 
the solitude of the life you lead that lends this sadness to your thoughts. Trust that a few short 
months will see me again in thine arms, dearest — I do not doubt it will be so. I must leave you 
now, or my guests will grow impatient at my delay. I have a surprise in store for them they wot 
not of. But you, young sir," he continued, holding out his arms to the infant, who crowed and 
leapt gladly into them, " you must away, away with me I I will secure to thee some acquaintances 
before I go to pay my devoirs to the infidel who lords it at the holy tomb." 

" Robert ! what mean you 1" — she was too late. They had disippeared ; but guided by the echo 
of his heavy tread, she stole softly after them in the direction of the banquet-hall. The loud shout 
■which hailed their entrance bursting along the corridors, quickened her steps. She gained the door 
and listened ; again a shout, louder than before, proclaimed that tender infant the acknowledged suc- 
cessor to the dukedom. Holding as mere trifles the sacred ties of marriage, and careless as their 
northern fore fathers of the distinction between wedlock and concubinage, with acclamations they 
swore the oath of fealty to the ofTspring of unwedded love. Louise listened, every limb trembling 
with joy, then sought her chamber, to indulge in a flood of tears, of mingled sorrow and gladness. 



262 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" Cruel ! thou knovvest well each lowest note of his cottage bird is dearer to Robert than the 
v/armest smile or spoken praise of the noblest lady whose satined foot e'er trod a palace-hall or whose 
flowing curls were bound by the diamond-sprinkled fillet." 

He paused for a moment to gaze fonilly in her face, and when he again resumed, his voice was 
softened into tenderness, and had lost a portion of that reckless intonation which peculiarly cha- 
racterized it. 

" Dost remember, fairest, the night when every window and portal of yonder tower streamed 
through the foliage that half-curtains it a joyous light far over the bosom of darkness, and every 
breeze that swept over the town was burdened with the sound of revelry — that night when every re- 
tainer, from the bearer of lance and shield to the meanest serf, quaffed loud and deep to the noble 
sister of Canute, the duke's English bride. It was upon this spot that one whose presence was 
missed in the banquet hall, who fled fiom the tumult of mirth which for once he could not enjoy, 
found you, Louise, pensive and alone. It was here, with that same sky bending above, scarce 
fairer or more pure than thine own thoughts, and yon same bright orb to witness and to smile ap- 
proval, as it seemeth even now to do, he pledged to you the homage of a heart which had long been 
a temple filled but with the presence of thine image, and listened with rapture to the avowal that 
Robert, the duke's chief huntsman, was far from indifferent in the e3'es of the fairest maiden in Fa- 
laise." 

Again he paused, and Louise murmured as half-unconscious of what she was saying — 

" The peasants in the vineyard and the cottage are loud in their praises of the beauty of the noble 
English lady." 

Her companion drew himself quickly back, as if to hide the expression which he felt was quiver- 
ing in the muscles of his lip, and flashing from his eye ; a moonbeam stealing thiough the leaves, 
fell that instant upon his bold and handsome countenance as it was half-upturned, showing each 
well-formed feature at the same time that it revealed the traces of a scarce governable passion, and of 
a wildness of mood which had gained for their possessor the sobriquet of Le Diable. The night- 
bieeze rustled the leaves, and that beam was again intercepted, but scarce less quickly had his 
features assumed their composure and his voice its winning tenderness. 

" Hush, Ijouise, you must not speak her praises to the duke. Start not — you have of late truly 
surmised that the almost unknown hunter who has won thy youthful love — and that he has won it 
each leaf around us and each star above is a silent witness — bears a title he would not exchange for 
any other less than king. That title he may not share with you — a cursed policy has already given 
it to another — but he here offers you all that he still can call his own, his heart and his protection : — 
be but his, and here, where first he whispered his vows, he swears by every thing that is pure and 
holy — by thyself and by the love he bears thee — by his honor and by the sword of his father — that 
thou and thine shall be honored and esteemed above all others within his wide domain. I read in 
thine eye, gentle one, what thou art about to say : — thy father, I would not sadden thee, but thy 
father is advanced in years. A short time, a very short time, and the valley sod may rest lightly on 
his breast ; then, oh ! why not before then, give thyself to one who can and will cherish and protect 
thee." 

But why follow the arguments of a tongue well skilled in pleading to gentle woman's heart — the 
persuasions of a spirit that seldom bent itself to win a maiden's confidence in vain. The moon rode 
higher in the heavens — the leaves bent and trembled in the increasing breeze, as if the tiny feet of a 
thousand fairies were twirling in rapid dance through the verdant mazes that shaded those lovers, 
yet still did those noble lips breathe burning words into the artless maiden's ear ; his arm unchecked, 
had sought again her waist, and her glowing cheek was resting in affectionate confidence uf)on his 
shoulder. 

A hasty step, however, heard far in the stillnes, broke their dream of rapture. A whispered 
sentence — " by the brook's green side" — a parting kiss, and Louise watched her lover's form bound 
over the green and vanish in the shade, ere she turned to meet her father, who gently chid her for 
allowing the cool-night air to chill the color from her cheek, then smiled to see how that color rushed 
again to her very temples at his playful chiding. 



It was moonlight again on Falaise. At the casement of one of the apartments of the castle sat 
a lady gazing in earnest and thoughtful silence at the spot where an opening in the underwood al- 
lowed a glimpse of one of the prettiest vine-sheltered cottages of the town. Her brow rested lightly 
on her hand, and a tear-drop trembled on one of her long eye-lashes, for a thousand sadly tender re- 
collections were stealing through her bosom with the noiseless rapidity of the flowing wave. It was 
Louise, the duke's favorite, as she was gently styled, and though years had flown by since she re- 
ceived his plighted love in the shade of that cottage-bower, yet time had swept with his wing nothing 
of the bloom from her cheek, nor had chilled with his touch any thing of the spring whose warm 
gush was felt in each heart's throb. She thought of her girlhood's days, when, the village-pride, she 
led her companions in the evening dance, then of those intoxicating hours of stolen love, and of the

Years rolled rapidly on, pregnant with important events. A monument at Nice, told of a noble 
pilgrim — the fourth lineal descendant of Rollo — who died on his return from Palestine. The valley 
flowers bloomed and faded on the sod beneath which lay the mouldering frame of one v/hose beauty 
was the theme of many a song, whose modest goodness was the burthen of many a fireside tale for 
leagues around the castle. But that infant, the son of the humble maid of Falaise, became William, 
duke of Normandy, and afterwards conqueror of England.

I LOVE thee! not because thy high clear brow 

Outvies the marble in its pearly whiteness, 

Nor for the beaming eye's gouI speaking brightness, 

Neither because thy voice, so sweet and low, 

The wind harp's rarest tone doth emulate. 

Nor yet because upon thy soft cheek glov/s 

A color stol'n from the lily and rose ; 

For these are gifts, alas ! which envious Fate, 

With all their charms, hath destined to decay; 

Eut those for which I chiefly prize thee — sense, 

Virtue, sinceritj', intelligence — 

These, my beloved, shall not pass away ; 

For when from Eaith their holy beauty flies, 

'Tis but to shine more brightly in the skies.

Oh give to me the lowliest forest flower 

Which mine own hand, fresh from its virgin stem. 

Hath plucked, before the brightest fairest gem 

That ever graced the garden or the bower, 

If it hath bloomed upon another's bi-east ! 

So with the heart of woman ! — I could see 

No charm in e'en an angel's witchery 

If by another she had been caressed. 

Oh give to me some simple village maid. 

The pure endearments of whose artless love 

I first may waken, and alone may prove; 

Who ne'er hath been, or hath herself betrayed -- 

Give me with her, remote from cities rude, 

To live and die in sylvan solitude.

With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my friend Morella. Thrown by 
accident into her society many years ago, my soul, from our first meeting, burned with fires it had 
never before known ; but the fires were not of Eros; and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the 
gradual conviction that I could in no manner define their unusual meaning, or regulate their vague 
intensity. Yet we met ; and Fate bound us together at the altar ; and I never spoke of passion, nor 
thought of love. She, however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone, rendered me 
happy. It is a happiness to wonder. It is a happiness to dream. 

Morella's erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents were of no common order — her 
powers of mind were gigantic. I felt this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I soon, how- 
ever, found that, perhaps on account of her Presbui'g education, she placed before me a number of 
those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature. 
These, for what reasons I could not imagine, were her favorite and constant study — and that in pro- 
cess of time they became my own should be attributed to the simple but eflectual influence of habit 
and example. 

In all this, if I err not, my reason had liitle to do. My convictions, or I forget myself, were in no 
manner acted upon by the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read, to be discover- 
ed, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts. Feeling deeply persuaded 
of this, I abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an unflinching 
heart into the intricacies of her studies. And then — then, when, poring over forbidden pages, I felt 
a forbidden spirit enkindling within me — would Morella place her cold hand upon my own, and 
rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low singular words whose strange meaning burn- 
ed themselves in upon my memory — and then, hour after hour, would I linger by her side and dwell 
upon the music of her voice — until, at length, its melody was tainted with terror — and fell like a 
shadow upon my soul — and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too unearthly tones. And 
thus Joy suddenly faded into Horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon 
became Ge-Henna. 

It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions, which, growing out of the 
volumes I have mentioned, formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of Morella and 
myself. By the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be readily conceived, 
and by the unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. The wild Pantheism of Fichte; 
the modified TlaA/&gt;Q,svs!rw of the Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines oi Identity as urged by 
Schelling, were generally the points of discussion piesejrting the most of beauty to the imaginative 
Morella. That Identity which is termed personal Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to consist in the 
sameness of a rational being. And since by person we understand an intelligent essence having 
reason, and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes 
us all to be that which we call ourselves — thereby distinguishing us from other beings that think, 
and giving us our personal identity. But the Princlplum Indivlduatlonis — the notion of that Iden- 
tity ivhlch at death is or is not lost forever, was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense interest, 
not more from tke mystical and exciting nature of its consequences, than from the marked and 
agitated manner in which Morella mentioned them. 



M O R E L L A , 265 

But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife's mannei oppiessed me as 
a spell. I could no longer bear the touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical 
language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all this but did not upbraid — she 
seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She seemed, also, con- 
scious of a cause, to me unknovvn, for the gradual alienation of my legard ; hut she gave me no 
liint or token of its nature. Yet was she woman, and pined away daily. In time, the crimson spot 
settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became prominent; and, 
one instant, my nature melted into pity, but, in the next, I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and 
then my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward into some 
dreary and unfathomable abyss. 

Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming desire for the moment of Morella's 
decease. I did ; but the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days — for many weeks 
and irksome months — until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew 
furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days, and the hours, and the bitter 
moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her gentle life declined — like shadows in the 
dying of the day. 

But one autumnal evening, when the winds hiy still in heaven, Morella called me to her side. 
There was a dim mist over all the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and, amid the rich 
October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen. As I came she was 
murmuring in a low undertone, which trembled with fervor, the words of a Catholic hymn. 

Sancta Maria! turn thine eyes 
Up(m a sinner's sacrifice 
Of fervent prayer and humble love 
From thy holy throne above. 

At morn, at noon, at twilight dim, 
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn; 
In joy and wo, in good and ill. 
Mother of God ! be with me still. 

When my hours flew gently by, 
And no storms were in the sky. 
My soul, lest it should truant be, 
Thy love did guide to thine and thee. 

Now, v/hen clouds of Fate o'ercast 
All my Present and my Past, 
Let my Future radiant shine 
With sweet hopes of thee and thine. 

" It is a day of days" — said Morella — " a day of all days either to live or die. It is a fair day for 
the sons of Earth and Life — ah ! more fair fot the daughters of Heaven and Death." 

I turned towards her, and she continued — 

" I am dying — yet shall I live. Therefore for me, Morella, thy wife, hath the charnel house qo 
terrors — mark me ! — not even the terrors of the worm. The days have never been when thou 
could'st love me ; but her whom in hfe thou didst abhor, in death ihou shalt adore." 

" Morella !" 

" I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that affection — ah, how little ! — which 
you felt for me, Morella. And when my spirit departs shall the child live — thy child and mine, 
Morella's. But thy days shall be days of sorrow — that sorrow which is the most lasting of im- 
pressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees. For the hours of thy happiness are over ; 
and Joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Posstum twice in a year. Thou shalt no 
longer, then, play the Teian with Time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt 
bear about with thee thy shroud on earth, as do the Moslemin at Mecca." 

" Morella !" — I cried — " Morella ! how knowest thou this V — but she turned away her face upon 
the pillow, and, a shght tremor coming over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more. 

Yet, as she had foretold, her child — to which in dying she had given birth, and which breathed 
not until the mother breathed no more — her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in 
stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who bad departed, and I loved her with 
a love more fervent and more intense than I had believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth. 

But, ere long, the Heaven of this pure affection became disturbed, and Gloom and Horror and 
Grief swept over it in clouds. I said the child grew strangely in stature and inteUigence. Strange 
indeed was her rapid increase in bodily size — but terrible, oh ! terrible were the tumultuous thoughts 
which crowded upon me while watching the development of her mental being. Could it be othet-

■wise when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the 
■woman 1 — when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy 1 and when the wisdom or 
the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaning from its full and speculative eye 1 When, I say, 
all this became evident to my appalled senses — when I could no longer hide it from my soul, nor 
throw it off" from those perceptions which trembled to receive it — is it to be wondered at that suspi- 
cions of a nature fearful and exciting crept in upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast 
upon the wild tales and thrilling theories of the entombed Morella 1 I snatched from the scrutiny 
of thewoild a being whom Destiny compelled me to adore, and, in the vigorous seclusion of my old 
ancestral home, watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned the beloved. 

And, as years rolled away, and I gazed, day after day, upon her holy and mild and eloquent face, 
and pored over her maturing form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in the 
child, to her mother the melancholy and the dead. And, hourly, grew darker these shadows of simi- 
litude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously tenible in their 
aspect. For that her smile was like her mother's I could bear ; but then I shuddered at its too per- 
fect ideniiiy — that her eyes were like Morella's I could endure ; but then they too often looked down 
into the depths of my soul with Morella's own intense and bewildering meaning. And in the con- 
tour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan lingers which buried 
themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and -above all — oh, above all — in the 
phrases and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the living, I found food for consu- 
ming thought and horror — for a worm that would not die. 

Thus passed away two lustrums of her life, but my daughter remained nameless upon the earth. 
" My child" and " my love" were the designations usually prompted by a father's affection, and the 
rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse. Morella's name died with her at her 
death. Of the mother I had never spoken to the daughter — it was impossible to speak. Indeed, 
during the brief period of her existence the latter had received no impressions from the outward 
world but such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy.' But at length the 
ceremon}^ of baptism presented to' my mind, in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present de- 
liverance from the tenors of my destiny. And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. And 
many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign lands, came 
thronging to my lips — and many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good. What 
prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead ] What demon urged me to breathe that 
sound, which, in its very recollection, was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the 
temples to the heart"! What fiend spoke from the recesses of my soul, when, amid those dim aisles, 
and in the silence of the night, I shrieked within the ears of the holy man the syllables — Morella? 
What more than fiend convulsed the features of my child, and overspread them with the hues of 
death, as, starting at that sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the Earth to Heaven, and, falling 
prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault, responded — "I am here !" 

Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct — like a knell of deatli — horrible, horrible death — sank the eternal 
sounds within my soul. Years — years may roll away, but the memory of that epoch — never! Now 
was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine — but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed 
me night and day. And I kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of my Fate faded from 
Heaven, and, therefore, the Eaith grew dark, and its Irgures passed by me like flitting shadows, and 
among them all I beheld only — Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed but one sound within 
my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore — MorelU. But she died ; and with my 
own hands I bore her to the tomb ; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found no traces 
of the first, in the charnel where I laid the second — Jtiorella. 



CONSOLATJON. 



BT ELIZABETH K. BAKKETT, 



All are not taken ! there are left behind 
Living Beloveds, tender looks to bring. 
And make the daylight still a blessed thing, 
And tender voices, to make soft the wind. 
But if it were not so — if I could find 
No love in all the world to answer me, 
Nor any pathway but rang hollowly. 



Where "dust to dust" the love from life disjoined — 

And if with parched lips, as in a dearth 

Of water-springs the very deserts claim, 

I uttered to those sepulchres unmoving 

The bitter cry, " Where are ye, O my loving!" 

I know a Voice would sound " Daughter, I am ! 

Can I suffice for Heaten, and not for earth ?" 



THOUGHTS ON THE LITERARY PROSPECTS OF AMERICA. 



AN ESSAY 



BE ATTCHAMP JOSHES, PHILAD 



The problem that all men are born with equal rights, has been settled by America in the face of 
the world — but that the Americans are endowed with all the intellectual attiibutes of the most 
favored of nature, time must discover, and conjectures for the future can only be based on the present 
condition of the people and the history of the past. 

If distinct races are differently gifted, and various climates peculiarly characterized in a mental 
point of view, the Americans may claim all the advantages resulting from either, inasmuch as they 
derive their origin from the most cultivated nations, and the extent of their territory embraces every 
■variety of climate. 

But it cannot be denied that the European countries possess many advantages over our republic 
in the pursuit of letters. They have their ancient institutions of learning, wherein the wisdom of 
ages is collected ; their professed authors, whose lives are devoted to literature ; and their gentlemen 
of leisure, whose fortunes are acquired by inheiitance, who naturally engage in the pursuit of 
literature and the elegant arts. These combine to maintain their enlightened position, and to facili- 
tate their future advances. They have a " long start" of the Americans in the great race for nation- 
al glory, and could mensuration as coiTectly set forth the destiny of states from premises palpable to 
all, as may be told the future revolutions of planets, calculated from the same infallible data which, 
has invariably proved correct — then the prize would inevitably be to the strong and experienced, and 
the new fledged aspirants of our young confederacy would doubtless be " distanced." 

There are also other c^iuses which might seem to indicate our present incompetency to contend 
witb Europeans for the glories of literature. We are not only destitute of an ancient and romantic 
history, but also indisposed to cherish legends of the past. The great mass of Americans have their 
thoughts only on the future, and their struggles are for money rather than for fame. Originally 
destitute and discontented, and driven by persecution to a new world, they have hitherto been em- 
ployed in the acquisition of those bodily comforts which the abode in a wilderness rendered so 
essential, and in fraroing a liberal mode of government to obviate all the evils endured in the country 
from which they fled. There still remain for the thrifty innumerable channels for the attainment of 
■wealth in our vast uncultivated regions of productive land. Our commerce is also far from its acme, 
and thousands are reaping the profits of mercantile enterprise. 

Thus, then, are we situated: With no classic institutions of foimer generations, no aristocratic 
classes possessing wealth and leisure, and but few who would barter their opportunities of accumu- 
lating riches for the precarious and often miserable occupation of an author. But the most power- 
ful and withering cause which has operated against the chances of our country in the competition 
for literary honors, has been the piratical course pursued by our publishers, in reprinting the pro- 
ductions of foreign pens, because they could be procured without expense. This has not only been 
the means of disheartening many a native writer, but it has also promiigated European fancies and 
European sentiments, until many citizens of the republic have imbibed a partiality for foreign 
customs, and readily adopt the fashions of gorgeous courts. The periodical press was long indebted 
to the same sources for its matter, and whilst American contributors were neglected and discouraged, 
the fame of some British scribbler was either acquired or consummated on this side of the Atlantic. 
Yet, notwithstanding all that may be said in favor of other countries, and to the disadvantage of 
America in the pursuit of literary renown, there is still a hope entertained by the Americans — a 
real or fancied star observed presiding over their destiny, in which they have implicit faith, and they 
continue to cherish the expectation, nay, determinatimi, to rival in greatness all that is recorded of 
the most glorious nations. And the miraculous triumphs they have accomplished seem to warrant 
their most extravagant expectations. Weak in numbers, oppressed and reviled, America threw back 
the scorns, and redressed the injuries heaped upon her by the most powerful and haughty empire of 
the earth. She opposed her infant strength to the giant arm of a mighty kingdom which had crush- 
ed its foes for centuries, and trusting to the justice of that Being, who endowed all mankind with 



268 . burton's gentleman's magazine. 

equal rights and immortal aspirations, she tiiiimphed even in her inauspicious condition, and estab- 
lished a noble and happy form of government, despite the obstacles interposed by old and grasping 
monaichies, the absence of celebrated law-givers, and her apparent destitution of national resources. 
The penetration of statesmen and the experience of sages had asseited the impossibility of success ; 
and yet the grand object of a diminutive, but determined band of men, was accomplished. 

This era in the revolutions of the earth, serves to prove that the magnitude and power of the 
liaman mind, cannot be measured by mathematical calculation. The sea of intellect has not yet 
been fathomed — for each generation continues to usher into existence hitherto undiscovered regions. 
Neither are the mariners of the illimitable mental ocean confined to the highborn. The worldly 
pool and the worldly degraded, possessing the divine gift of mind, not unfrequently mount higher 
in the flowery fields of imaginaiion, and penetrate farther in the intricacies of science, than those 
who have been reared amongst the ponderous tomes of time honored colleges. 

When the mysterious and immortal ray of genius is implanted in the breast by the hand of the 
high priest of Nature, all other requisitions — the titles of inheritance, the academic lessons of learn- 
ed masters, and even the '-miles of cheering friends, are but secondary considerations to the predes- 
tined fortune of the recipient. Where was the line of kings from which Napoleon descended 1 
Would it not have provoked a smile, had the plodding youth v\'hen but a humble subordinate, 
whispered his secret hopes and aspirations ] And yet the spark which then but feebly flickered 
in his ambitious heart, ere long blazed forth the brightest sun in the military world. No circum- 
stances can defeat the destiny of mind : chains cannot fetter it, nor can any power short of prescience 
prescribe its limits. The inspired bard of our father-land had no teacher on his loved banks of 
Avon but Nature, and yet his works have become the precepts of all learned doctors. Who can 
see the career of gifted minds ! Who can say to our young republic, " thus far slialt thou go, and 
no farther." 

The history of America is before her. The account of her birth, and the vigor of her growth in 
the nursery, are yet only inscribed on the tablets of her history. What may be written in future, 
who can telll That she is peculiarly favored of heaven, her herculean act of strangling the serpent 
of tyranny at her birth is conclusive evidence. What greater work of the intellect can be conceived, 
than the establishment of a novel and perfect system of government, embracing an immense conti- 
nent and administering to the wants of many millions of people 1 And if America has excelled in 
arms, triumphed in legislation, and linked her commerce with every fruitful land, is it to be supposed 
that she will long remain indifferent to the glories of literature '' She boasts her philosophers, her 
orators, and artists, whose names have reached beyond the confines of their country — and truly, but 
some half dozen authors — and thus there is a woful discrepancy in her literary reputation. 

The Americans have hitherto been accustomed to look to England for literary aliment, and how- 
ever pernicious the viands might prove which were set before them by the industrious caterers for 
public taste, yet they became fashionable, and their use almost universal. The American publisher 
could obtain every new work free of expense, and the prejudice once existing against the mother 
country gradually subsiding as our blessing increased, his shelves were relieved of their volumes by 
greedy purchasers, and thus his profits were made enormous, because no expenditure was required 
to keep his press in motion. Native authors could get neither smiles nor money for their labors. 
Foreign writers were laudfjd by mercenary critics, and read by the community, whilst American as- 
pirants languished in neglect, until habit had nearly riveted the mental yoke of British bondage im- 
perceptibly on the same people, who once rose in their power and defied the embattled hosts of the 
most warlike nation of the earth. Legislators feared to make enactments protecting our writers, 
luidei the impression, that the facilities of disseminating knowledge among the people, would be 
" too suddenly curtailed,'' by arresting the piratical traffic in the productions of mind. So long had 
we luxuriated on the rich cargoes of free traders without the expense of freight or duty, and so 
long been accustomed to look in vain for a rivalry in similar wares amongst ourselves, that a senator 
from Pennsylvania openly avowed his fears, that should the authors of other countries be privileged 
to enjoy the exclusive advantages of their own property on this side of the ocean, and the rising 
generation be compelled to look to their own scholars for erudition, a dearth of intellect might ensue, 
which would be ruinous to (|ir futui-e welfare. In this manner did tories and old women argue, 
when it was proposed to destroy the tea in Boston. A slight sacrifice, and a resolute struggle, and 
the shackles of mind will be removed, as were the chains of oppression when we determined to be 
free! Although the law for the protection of American authors was doubtful in its origin, sluggish 
in its progress, and is still pending, yetits passage must now be inevitable, for t\ie people have taken 
it under consideration, and their decision may be indicated by the recent change of the estimation 
in which Americans writers were held. The fiat of the nation will be for the encouragement of 
native authors, and before this generation shall have passed away, the complexion of our literature 
will be changed ; genius will soar beyond the taunts of bloated sycophants, and not only receive its 
ample reward in worldly emoluments, but authorship will be considered, as it justly merits to be, 
the most exalted pursuit of man. 

The change is now in operation. American authors, and American books, even now, are no 
longer the objects of ridicule abroad. Their merit is at length acknowledged in those countries most

famed for talent, and American works are beginning to be re-piinted and extensively circulated 
amongst those who have hitherto alTected to jeer our impotence. 

At home, we perceive a numerous and intelligent class of readers evincing a determination to 
foster native talent. Having in vain anticipated the passage of a law of protection, with a com- 
mendable public virtue which should be honored through all time, they have resolved to test the 
clFicacy of the American mind, and consequently, the interminable tales of German ghosts, and the 
nauseous productions of English epicures, have been almost simultaneously banished from our pe- 
riodical press, and the rage ibr original contributions substituted in their place. The periodicals 
which persisted in furnishirig their readers exclusively with stale re- publications, are now, (with one 
or two exceptions, and these aie supported by resident foreigners,) amongst the forgotten things of 
the past, and those most successful are entirely composed of original mattei. This is a change in 
our literary prospects of no ordinary import: it forms an era in the literature of America. From 
the great number of elegant magazines springing into existence, it is proven that we are a reading 
community ; and from the decided favor now bestowed on native talent, it is seen that the sovereign 
people have espoused the cause of their own authors, despite the dilatory proceedings of their servants 
in congress. The voice of the nation will be for national writers, and the spread of republican 
principles ; and those representatives vyIio may persist in thwarting their desires will reap a nation's 
censure. 

The present is the most auspicious period for America to commence her literary career. Whilst 
the wounds of self-infliction, caused by the neglect to form a just copy-right law, are yet rankling 
and ere time shall make our habit of submission to Europeans in the grand efforts of mind a por- 
tion of our nature, the corner-stone of a noble structure might be laid, which the genius of the peo- 
ple should rear in future far higher than any has yet been done by the most cultivated nations. Con- 
scious power will strain every fibre to prevent defeat by the artifices of the feeble. American 
writers, though laboring under continued poverty and neglect, have continued to struggle on. They 
have finally succeeded in winning the irreed of admiration even from their rivals. And now, when 
the tide of popular prejudice, and the laxity of the laws which opposed them are being remuved, and 
the mind indignant with the wrongs it has endured, and its energies roused to triumph over every 
obstacle, is the most fitting time for our authors to assert their claims for celebrity. They will have 
retribution for the injuries they have sustained ; for the removal of the clouds which so long obscured 
them, will serve to display their light with ten-fold brilliance. 

The time is approaching when the labor of the mind will as readily command its reward as the 
labor of the hands. Pens that have long remained idle, will be in requisition, and genius will cast 
its rags to be arrayed in robes. In the most prosperous states of antiquity, true greatness coirsisted 
in exalted wisdom and unblemished virtue. One giant intellect exercised more influence than a 
thousand stalwart men of ordinary faculties. Such will be the case in our country, and already has 
one president set an example for future rulers. Whatever may be the trusts reposed iir the hands of 
literary men, by the president or the people, its safe keeping, and the faithful discharge of the duties 
appertaining, may be confidently relied upon. History mentions but few (if any) instances, wherein 
the meritoiious aspirants for literary fame have proved wanting in mairiy integrity. The fiuits of 
dishonesty can only be enjoyed by the recipient during his sojourn on earth. The true child of 
genius anticipates an eternity of enjoyment, and would not barter his interest in a future age for an 
empire gained by injustice, and mahitained in blood, wherein his name would be buried in his grave, 
or only remembered to be execiated. The man of gifted mind finds no interest in the fleeting sweets 
of the earth, but soars heavenward in glorious thought, cleaves the ethereal air beyond the eagle's 
flight, scans with feehngs of unmingled delight, the stupendous works of nature in the eternal cloud 
capped hills, the roar of the unfathomed ocean, or the revolutions of innumerable worlds, and bows 
in unfeigned adoration to the great authoii of all. 

Neither the glittering ingots of gold so much v,'orshipped by the grasping, nor the flitting reward 
of intrigue and deception so much idolized by the politician, have any charms for the man of genius ; 
for he possesses a world within himself of which no misfortune can bereave him, and which perish- 
es not with the body. When his eye rests furtively on surrounding objects, and men pass lay un- 
noticed, and sounds vibrate through the air unheard, the pallid brow is not the record of remorse, 
nor the fixed abstraction the trance of stupor. The mind is busy with meditations unknown to the 
multitude, and the soul is exulting in the consciousness of immortality. He feels the link that binds 
him to another state of existence, where the prizes which men toil for on earth are unknown and 
valueless, save a good name, and he scorns the gauds that would tempt the short-sighted to leap be- 
yond the bounds of honor. There is every reason for America to exalt her men of genius. They 
can neither stoop to peculation with a thirst for gain, nor be swayed by intimidation from the path 
of rectitude. Such alone are the pillars which must support our institutions through future ages. 

America has not yet had a fair field, in the competition fot literary laurels : but the consequence 
will be instead of defeat and despondency, a redoubled vigilance and an unswerving determination 
to excel. Had we contended on equal grounds, we should have submitted openly, had defeat been 
possible to Americans. But this has not been the case. What success could even an Irving, a 
Cooper or a Paulding expect, (to say nothing of those possessing extraordinary merit, but who from 



270 buhton's gentleman's magazine. 

the suicidal course pursued in regard to a national literature, are without " a habitation and a name,") 
when the works of a Goldsmith, a Scott and a Bulwer, were offered to the reader at the booksellers' 
counter, for one third of the amount demanded for American boobs? 

Yet foreign critics, not content with the vantage ground they possessed, (when driven from the 
assumption that " no one reads an American book,") have directed their thunders against those 
amongst us who, from factitious circumstances, have obtained an ephemeral notoriety. After having 
in vain attempted to transfix the eagle with their malignant shafts, they would fain vent their enmity 
on the innocent butterfly. That an abundance of game may be found amongst us for their employ- 
ment, there cannot exist a doubt: but that their efforts to destroy the gilded vermin, will be attended 
with injury to the country, is not in the most remote degree to be apprehended. Genius soars the 
higher, when the object of pointed scrutiny. But it cannot be denied that amongst us, as in all 
nations, the weak and the vain are to be found. A rich man may acquire more popularity from the 
perpetration of a few jingling stanzas, than a despised son of the garret shall obtain from volumes, 
containing the gems of divine thought. But the praise of the one ceases at the grave, whilst the 
name of the other lives after him. 

It is a rehance on an unerring future, which inspires the child of genius to toil in obscurity. He 
relinquishes the prospects of immediate gain, in a total abandonment of every enjoyment, for some 
all-absorbing desire of the soul. Every power of the mind and body is exerted foi the accomphsh- 
ment of his grand object. Nor is his life, however degraded in the estimation of those more fortunate 
in the possession of wordly goods, bereft of every pleasure. The blurred walls of his wretched hovel 
sink before his sparkling eye, and his fruitive imagination calls into existence porphyry palaces of 
splendor, and his teeming fancy peoples them with appreciating beings who bow in reverence to his 
power. Ideal virgins crown him with rich chaplets, and a million voices salute him as the great 
master spirit. Thus it is why the author retires to commune with himself. Unfit to strive with the 
thrifty for gold, and finding no companionship in those who indulge not in inspired revery, he locks 
himself within his gloomy closet, and although hooted by the idle populace, yet is he enabled to 
unroll the scroll of the future, and enjoy in anticipation, the fame of his mighty works. Should 
his hopes never be realized, his pleasure is noire the less: but there must be some secret assurance 
of reward, which induces a mortal to devote his life to the cause of letters, to neglect the smiles of 
fortune and endure the evils of poverty. 

The oft repeated remark that " poets are always poor," has become a proverb ; and the profession 
of authorship, if connected with poverty, in the estimation of the money making community, is a 
disgraceful calling. The works of mind branded with disgrace ! But it may be accounted for in 
the continued neglect of genius on the part of those who should patronize it, and its own unobtru- 
sive character and unconquerable pride which revolts at the thought of solicitation. Authors are 
poor, and povert}'' a reproach. • It remains for America to amend the evil. But a small portion of 
the money expended by the public for corrupt political purposes, would rescue every scribbler in the 
universe from starvation. Meritorious writers should be fostered : they cannot be exalted too high ; 
nor will thej' repay the favors of their country with ingratitude. 

The nature of a people is in some degree assimilated with the character of the country and clime 
they inhabit. America, with her territory fifteen hundred miles square, and her latitude varying 
from the soft gales of Arcadia, to the rude blasts of Russia, may boast a broader field for intellectual 
enterprise than any nation of the earth. Accustomed to viewing immense cities in every direction; 
beholding vast lakes and unfathomed bays; rivers, whose length surpasses any in the world; and in- 
terminable plains, whose dimensions the compass and the chain have not yet marked — the mind is 
naturally more expansive, than when confined within the limits of a narrow state or island, where 
the eye takes in at one glance nearly the whole penfold of a monarch's clustering subjects. 

Each citizen of America is one of the supreme lords 'of the land. He journeys for days and weeks, 
and whithersoever he places his foot, he may exclaim, " This is my country." ^o tyrant dare con- 
front him, and he proudly feels the blessings of liberty. Every one then, enjoys an interest in the 
confederacy. Whilst the aristocrats who have their titles and wealth at stake in Europe, constitute 
the only class willing to exert themselves for the perpetuity of established institutions, and the ac- 
cession of governmental power, in America, ever}' individual exults in the glory of his country, and 
would freely die to maintain its honor. The whole nation is desirous of national renown, and every 
man is willing to contribute to its acquisition. Thus, whilst but a select few may hope to win mi- 
litary or literary laurels in regal governments, our republic opens the lists for every man. Nor is 
it without a possibility of success that the humblest and most obscure join in the competition for 
literary fame, as well as for martial glory. An inscrutable Providence makes no distinction in the 
gifts of mind : nor is the wealth of intellect inherited like kingdoms. If the laborer's son is deserv- 
ing, he is born to the privilege of being a president. We have no distinctions but those of the heart 
and mind. The man, and not his occupation, is the standard of respectability. The prospects of 
all are equal, and the efforts of each enhance the prospects of the nation. 

There is not a lyceum in this fair city, but performs a service to the country. The poorest me- 
chanic may shed lustre on his native land. He may command armies, preside over councils, or 
confer benefits on future generations by the blessings of wisdom. It matters not what may be his 



THE LETTER OVER SEA

trade, nor what the condition of his purse : if heaven has touched his heart with one ghmmer of 
genius, he may surmount every obstacle. The want of academic tutors, and the absence of the ten 
thousand gilded volumes unread in the rich man's library, need not deter him. Nature " is mighty 
and can pievail." Even in the land where rank and wealth combined to crush the hopes of honest 
poverty, the genius of a Burns inscribed his name in living letters, which will be read until the lan- 
guage expires. But in this land the meritorious need not look to the beneficence of the great for re- 
ward ; they have the bestowal of honors and emoluments in their own hands, and the highest in 
office is dependent on their favor. The poor form a majority in all countries, and where the multi- 
tude is ignorant and debased, the supremacy of the laws can only be maintained by the sword. Thus 
citizens sink to slaves. But when the humbler classes are impressed with the value of knowledge, 
and often meet to make interchange of thought, to sally together up the delightful heights of 
science, or gather perenne roses in the inexhaustible fields of poetry ; men rise almost to gods, and 
neither traitors nor tyrants will ever attempt to enslave them. 

The ancients would never have degenerated, had such men as Socrates and Cicero been cherish- 
ed. But in that evil hour, when the best friends of the state were doomed to death, the curse of igno- 
rance, and its attendant despotism, seized upon the people. The poison which passed the lips of 
Socrates penetrated the vitals of Greece, and the axe that fell upon the neck of Cicero, severed the 
head of Rome. 

The superiority of mind over every other possession of man, is sufficiently proven by the endu- 
rance of its works, after every other vestige of his being is swallowed up in the yawning gulph of 
oblivion. The crumbling columns of the Pantheon speak the skill, but not the names of the artisans 
who wrought them. Mighty heroes have risen, and after brandishing their gory swords a few brief 
years, have returned to dust, to be no more remembered forever, whilst Cicero's fearless accusation 
of Catiline in the senate, and even the gentle Pliny's account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius;^ 
are still the subjects of universal admiration. 



THE LETTE 



OVER SEA 



BX CATHARIJJE H. WATEKMAN. 



We've seen the blooming buds and flowers 
Of six bright spring-times greet the day. 
And deem'd that each with scented hours, 
Wo\ild speed thee on thy homeward way. 
They past — and when the smiling sky 
Took the deep tint of summer's blue. 
We fondly thought thou would'st be nigh. 
To watch the roses as they grew ; 
Thou earnest not — but swift to me, 
There sped a letter over sea. 

The flowers drooped upon the bough. 
Their sunny hues were bright, and brief, 
And sadness gather'd on my brow, 
As fell the Autumn's yellow leaf; 
They thickly peopled all the ground. 
And winter spread her mantle drear, 
And moaning winds were heard around, 
Yet the loved wanderer was not here ; 
And all that came to tell of thee, 
Was that dear letter, over sea.

Time stole the brightness from the eye, 
And chill'd the bosom's sunniest glow, 
And taught his icy touch to lie 
Upon ihe heart-stream's gentle flow. 
Had shaded all the happy days. 
That we together fondly knew. 
And dimm'd the brightness of those rays 
That made our skies for ever blue ; 
But still it brought unchangingly, 
That one loved letter over sea. 

I Now what a cloud hath dimm'd those skieSf 
And what dark shadows compass all! 
What stormy tempests did arise. 
To shroud our hopes with such a pall 1 
Thou'st found the Lethean draught, and there 
Bath'd in its stream thy heart and brow, 
And they who love thee lonely share 
Each sad remembrance of thee now. 
Thou hast forgotten — and to me, 

' Comes no loved letter over eea.

THE THREE BATTLES. 

SicojfD. — RuNNiiVG Dowx THE Thades ; OR THE Capture of the Java. 

" Gun and gun together meet, 
Fire and sword each other greet." 

The victorious frigate now departed from Boston under a new commander — commodore William 
Bainbridge — and after missing the Essex, captain Porter, and leaving the Hornet, captain Lawrence, 
blockading a British sloop of war at St. Salvador, she ran down the coast of Brazil, and when within 
ten leagues of the land, made two strange sail in shore and to windward. Captain Hull, covered 
with the palm of glory, had generously left the lucky frigate to Bainbridge, and it will be seen in 
the sequel that he could not have left her in better hands. 

The writer of this sketch was once the intimate friend, and a confidential officer of that illustrious 
man ; and though time and disease had at that period borne heavily upon his maidy form, and tipped 
with silver his raven locks, Bainbridge was still a noble specimen of the stern old fire-eaters of the 
Tripolitan war, and possessed a vivid recollection of the scenes which transpired 

" When the Java lowered her lion flag, 
And victory crowned the free." 

He was a man of sterling integrity, of haughty mien, and of generous impulses. He possessed 
great courage, a lofty enthusiasm, a quick temper, and a sharp tongue. No man ever saw him twice 
who forgot him ; and no man ever knew him to be his enemy twice who did not wish him to forget 
him. With an eagle eye, he read men like books, and, like a skilful critic, he laid those carefully 
upon the shelf who were not suited to the purpose for which they were sent forth. 

As we said before, the Constitution made two sail to windward, one of whom continued to stand 
in, while the other, which was much the largest, altered her course in the direction of the American 
frigate, which had tacked close to her. The day was beautiful, the sea smooth as an inland lake, 
and the wind a catspaw from E. IV. E. At 11, A. M. commodore Bainbridge, who sate in the miz- 
zen top, glass in hand, being satisfied that the strange sail was an enemy's frigate, tacked again to 
the southward and eastward, to draw her off the land, which was near at hand. The frigate now 
set her royals, and boarded maintack to effect this object. At 13, M., the Constitution showed the 
stars and stripes, and shortly after, St. George's cross floated at the peak-halliards of the stranger. — 
Signals were now made by both ships, but there are none so blind as those who can't, or won't read. 
At twenty minutes past 1, commodore Bainbridge, being satisfied with the ofling he had made, hand- 
ed his royals, triced up his mainsail, and tacked towards the enemy. Soon after, both ships had their 
heads to the southward and eastward, the English being a mile to windward, on the Constitution's 
quarter. The enemy had now hauled down his ensign, though he kept a jack flying ; and commo- 
dore Bainbridge, like himself alone, ordered a shot fired ahead of him, to induce him to show his 
colors anew. Tnis order settled the quaveiing, and at 2, P. M., a furious cannonade took place, 
*?hich can only be described by those who listened to it. 

As the enemy could make the most of a light wind, he soon forged ahead of Old Ironsides, but 



OLD IRONSIDES. ' 273 

was foiled by the latter ship's waring, which brought the two belligerents head and head to the west- 
ward. In manceuvering, the enemy steered free, and Old Ironsides luffed — the vessels got within 
pistol shot, when the first repeated the same attemi)t — the ships waring together — bringing their 
heads easterly, as at first. 

The English frigate now tacked, to preserve the weather-gage, but missing stays, she was obliged 
to ware — a manoeuvre that the Constitution had executed before hei, to prevent being raked, for her 
wheel had been shot away, and it was difficult to watch the vessel with the helm as closely as was 
desirable. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, the Constitution was the first in coming to the wind 
on the other tack; and an efficient raking fire told his Britannic majesty's frigate when she came 
about. Both vessels now ran off free with the wind on the quarter, the English ship still to wind- 
ward, when the latter, having received much damage, made an attempt to close. 

At fifty-five minutes past two, the enemy ran dovsm upon the Constitution's quarter ; but running 
her jib-boom afoul of the Constitution's mizzen-rigging, she suffered severely, without being able to 
effect her purpose. Her bowsprit cap was soon shot away, and in a few minutes, her foremast, with 
a thundering crash, came by the board. 

The Constitution now shot ahead, to avoid being raked, and in separating, the stump of the ene- 
my's bowsprit swept the American fiigate's taffrail. 

The two ships now brought the wind abeam, again with their heads to the eastward. The Con- 
stitution fore-reaching, in consequence of her surplus sail, wore, passed her antagonist, luffed up un- 
der his quarter, pitched into him a ton or two of cold iron, and wore again. The Englishman, not 
being fond of those pills which were through not only by daylight, but which made the daylight pass 
through him, kept away. The Constitution, however, soon had him again ; and for a short time, 
the vessels lay broadside and broadside — yard-arm and yard-arm — while the surrounding atmosphere 
was filled with rolling clouds of sulphurous smoke, and the gentle billows of the ocean blushed in 
blood. 

In a few moments, away went the mizzenmast, with the banner of the haughty Briton, leaving 
nothing but the yardless mainmast standing — black with smoke, and smeared with gore. 

As the enemy's fire had ceased, the Constitution hauled her tacks aboard, and luffed athwart her 
antagonist's bow ; passing out of the combat to windward, at five minutes past four, with her top- 
sails, courses, spanker, and jib set. In executing this mancBUvre, commodore Bainbiidge was under 
the impression that the enemy had struck — the ensign which had floated from his main rigging be- 
ing down, his ship a wreck, and his fire silenced. 

The Constitution having repaired damages, and secured her masts, perceiving an ensign still float- 
ing on board the enemy, wore round, and stood directly across the enemy's fore-foot. The English 
vessel anticipated the frigate's broadside by striking. At this moment, the enemy's mainmast went 
by the board, and the dark hull lay shattered and bleeding upon the waters. 

A boat nov\fewas sent on board the enemy, under the charge of Mr. Parker, the first lieutenant. 
The prize proved to be the British frigate .Java, of thirty-eight guns, captain Lambert, commander, 
bound to the East Indies. She had on board lieutenant general Hislop and staff, several supernu- 
merary sea officers, and a considerable number of men, intended for other ships, 

After removing the prisoners, and lying by the Java two days, commodore Bainbridge ordered her 
to be set on fire, and from the flaming wreck took his departure for St. Salvador. 

In this action, the Constitution had but nine killed, and twenty-five wounded — among the latter, 
were commodore Bainbridge and lieutenant Alwyn. The last died of his injuries shortly after the 
huzza of victory had wakened the echoes of the deep. Commodore Bainbridge was wounded in 
the hip with a musket ball, early in the action, and the shot that carried away the wheel of his ves- 
sel drove a copper bolt into his thigh, inflicting a severe and dangerous wound. He kept the deck, 
notwithstanding, until midnight. The Constitution came out of this action scatheless, with a few 
sHght exceptions. 

Not so with the Java. She lost her masts — her hull was greatly injured — and her number of kill- 
ed and wounded was unusually large. According to commodore Bainbridge, there were sixty of, 
the former, and one hundred and one of the latter. According to the British published accounts 
there were but twenty-two of the former, and one hundred and two of the latter. Commodore Bain- 
bridge was undoubtedly correct. 

Many anecdotes of personal bravery have been recorded as having occurred during this conflict. 
Where all were brave, no invidious distinctions need be made. This action proved — as did that of 
the Guerriere — that in naval gunnery the Americans were superior to the world. And all this talk 
about weight of metal is all in my eye. If John Bull could not hit our vessels with a twenty-four 
pourrd shot, what evidence is there that he would have hit them with a thirty-two pound shot 1 The 
difference in?ize between the two could not have exceeded two inches in diameter. So much for weight 
of metal and English naval flummery, to offset the effects of American naval gunnery. 

Throughout this whole battle, commodore Bainbridge manifested the greatest coolness and cou- 
rage, and after the bloody deed was done, overwhelmed the dying Lambert and his officers with his 
kindness. It may not be amiss to note here a dream which commodore Bainbridge had, the evening 
previous to the action, which he related to the author a few months before his death. Whether

dreams foretell events, or not, is nothing to my purpose ; I tell the tale as it was told to me, and the 
world may have it at the same price, namely, by giving their attention. 

Commodore Bainbridge, as he lay in his birth, dreamed three times in succession, during the night 
previous to the action, that he fell in with and, after a bloody encounter, captured a British frigate, 
having red coats aboard — that her starboard gangway was shot away, and that the officers in coming 
on board his vessel came down the larboard ladder — that the frigate equalled him in size, and out- 
numbered him in ciew — that her masts were all shot away — and that hei commander was killed. 

Commodore Bainbridge, haunted tey the spirit-stirring spectacle, could not sleep — he arose from 
his pillow, and after pacing his little cabin for a short time, sate down to his writing desk, and wrote 
a letter to Mrs B., in v;hich he stated the facts as dreamed by him, but stated them positively, leav- 
ing the blanks for the ship's name, commander's name, force, and other minor things, unfilled. The 
next da}', the Java was captured, and the commodore merely filled up the blanks of the letter, and 
sent it to his wife as the first account of his victory. 

After landing his prisoners at &gt;St. Salvador, and refitting ship, commodore Bainbridge shaped his 
course for the United States, and on the 37th of February, 1813, anchored in the harbor of Boston, 
and was received at the long wharf by the City Council, amid the shouts of the multitude, the thun- 
der of cannon, and the pealing of bells. 

This was a finisher to all objections — those people who knew the Amen'cans would be whipped 
in fair fight, knew much less ever afterwards. The lion had been humbled again by the same gal- 
lant little frigate, and another flag of battle waved its smoke and blood-stained folds in the hall of 
Congress. 



TiiiRr). — Taki&gt;'g Two; or the Capture of the Cyaxe Aisrn the Letajtt. 

" Again the iron hail, 
And the thunder note of war." 

On the 17th of December, 1814, Old Ironsides sailed from Boston, under the command of captairi 
Charles Stewart. She first ran off Beimuda, thence she steered for the Madeiras, and still finding 
nothing worthy of her thunder, entered the Bay of Biscajy. 

Cruizing down the shoie of Portugal, she made the rock of Lisbon, and continued in sight of the 
barren peaks of Centra for some days. Here she made two prizes, one of which she destroyed, and 
the other she sent in. 

While in this vicinity, she made a large ship in the offing, and gave chase, but before she had set 
her courses, she made a prize, and while securing it, the strange sail disappeared in the distance. 
This was the Elizabeth, 74, which came out of Lisbon, in quest of the saucy frigate; but captain 
Stewart stood to the southward and westward, in quest of an enemy, said to be in that direction.- — 
On the morning of the 20th February, the wind blowing a light Ijevanter, captain Stewart, for the 
want of something better to do, ordered the helm up, and ran his ship off to the south-west, varying 
her position nearly two degrees. At 1, P. M., a sail was made on the larboard bow, and the stranger 
hauled three points to windward, and made sail in chase. In twenty minutes, the stranger was made 
out to be a ship, and in a short half hour, a consort was seen to leeward, signalizing the ship in chase. 
At 4. P. M., the ship nearest to the Constitution made a signal to the leev^'ard ship, and soon the lat- 
ter kept away, and ran down towards hei, then about three miles under her lee. The Constitution 
immediately squared her yards, and set her studding-sails above and below. No doubt of the enmity 
of the strangers now remained. The nearest vessel appeared to be a jackass frigate, and the most 
distant one, a corvette. The first was carrying studding-sails on both sides, while the last was run- 
ning ofi' under short canvass, to allow her consort to close. 

Captain Stewart, believing that the enemy was endeavoring to escape, crowded on every thing 
that would draw, with a view to get the nearest vessel under his guns before night. At half-past 
four, the Constitution lost her main-royalmast, and the chase gained upon her. A few shots were 
now fired, but finding that his metal fell short, the attempt to ciipple the frigate was abandoned. At 
half-past five, the drums on board the gallant Constitution beat to quarters, and soon she was cleared 
for action. In ten minutes, the two vessels of the enemy passed within hail of each other, came by 
the wind, with their heads to the northward, hauled up their courses, and cleared ship to engage. 

Both of the enemy's vessels, as though animated by a new idea, now suddenly made sail close by 
the wind, in order to weather upon the American frigate, but perceiving that the latter was closing 
too fast, they hauled up their courses and formed on the wind, the smallest ship ahead. 

At 6, P. M., Old Ironsides had the enemy completely under her cannon, and yawing gracefully, 
showed the star-spangled banner beautiful amid the closing shadows of the ocean night. The stran- 
gers answered this proud defiance by setting English colors, and in five minutes, the American fri- 
gate ranged up abeam of the sternmost vessel, at one cable's length distance, passing ahead with her 
sails lifting, until the three ships formed a triangle, the Constitution being to windward. 



OLD IRONSIDES. 275 

Now commenced the action, with a vehemence that was haidly equalled on the sea. At the end 
of twenty minutes, the fire of the enemy evidently slackened, and the moon coming up, captain 
Stewart ordered the cannonading to cease. The sea was covered with an immense cloud of smoke. 
Beautiful as the silver veil of Mokanna, was the fleecy screen that rested upon the ocean, and ter- 
xible as the visage of the veiled pro[)het was the scene that burst upon the sight of the English three 
minutes afterwards, when the rolling vapor passed swiftly to leeward, and showed the American fri- 
gate ready to pour forth her volleys on either side, from her black low of teeth. The leading ship 
of the enemy was now seen under the Ice beam of the Constitution, while the sternmost one was 
luffing up, as if she intended to tack and cross her stern. Giving a broadside to the ship abreast of 
her, that made a great many vacant numbers in her mess-book, the Constitution backed her main 
and mizzen topsails and topgallant-sails, shook all forward, let fly her jib-sheet, and backed swiftly, 
compelling the enemy to fill away, to avoid being raked. The leader now attempted to cross the 
Constitution's fore-foot, when the latter boarded her fore-tack, shot ahead, forced her antagonist to 
ware under a raking broadside, and to run off to leeward, to escape from her destructive fire. The 
Constitution, perceiving that the largest ship was waring also, wore in her turn, and crossing her jl; 

stern, raked her with cfTect, though the enemy came by the wind immediately and delivered her lar- 
board broadside ; but as the Constitution ranged up close on hei weather quarter, she struck. Lieu- 
tenant Hoifman, the second of the Constitution, was immediately sent on board of her, and in a few 
minutes afterwards he returned, with tire sword of captain Falcon, of H. B. M. ship Cyane, of 34 
guns. In the meantime, the other vessel ef the enemy, having repaired her running rigging, hauled 
up, and met the t'onstitution coming down in quest of her. It was nearly nine o'clock, when the 
two vessels ciossed each other on opposite tacks, and delivered their awful broadsides. The English 
ship was satisfied with the first fire and bore up, while the American followed, laking and boring her 
with her broadside and bow-chasets, ripping off the planks, and mowing down the men, like the 
fiery thunderbolts of heaven. The enemy could not stand this riddling long; the crashing of the 
planks was heard on board the Constitution at every fire, and the groans of the dying enemy echoed 
mournfully over the moonlit wave. 

At 10, P. M., the chase came by the wind, fired a gun to leeward, and lowered her ensign. Lieu- 
tenant Shubrick, the third of the frigate, was now sent on board of the prize, and upon his return, 
the sword of the honorable captain Douglass, of H. B. M. ship Levant, of 18 guns, was laid upon 
the capstan of the Constitution. 

At 1, A. M., the conqueror was ready for another action. She sufiered less in her crew than when 
she captured the Java. Not an officer was hurt ; but she was hulled ofiener in this engagement 
than in both her previous battles. Great credit was deservedly bestowed upon captain Stewart, for 
the skill and coolness displayed by him on this occasion. He fought two ships and conquered them 
without having been once raked ; and his backing and filling his single frigate in a cloud of smoke, 
laking his opponents in turn, and forcing them down to leeward when they were endeavoring to 
cross his stern or fore-foot, was a piece of manceuvering scarcely paralleled in the annals of any navy. 
Captain Stewart, having secured his prizes, proceeded to Port Praya, where he arrived in safety 
on the 10th of March, and anchored near the town. A vessel was soon engaged as a cartel, and 
over one hundred prisoners were landed, with a view to aid in fitting her for sea. 

On the 1 1th of March, however, the old ship ran another squeak. It was a foggy day, when the 
sun looked down fiom the hazy heavens, and a cloud of mist rested heavily upon the waters of the 
ocean. The prisoners jolly " Yo, oh heave, oh !" echoed along the shore, and the American officer \ 

of the watch paced along the quarter-deck of the Constitution without noticing the clouded bosom 

of the ocean, when an English reefer exclaimed, " A ship, by ." One of the English captains 

gave the young sprig a silent reprimand, but it came too late, the plot was discovered before it was 
fairly hatched, and disappointment rested upon the faces of the past officers of the Cyane and Le- 
vant. Lieutenant Shubrick, ever on the alert, looked over the quarter and beheld the sails of a large 
ship looming over the fog. She appeared to be looking into the harbor. 

After examining the stranger attentively, lieutenant Shubrick reported her approach to captain 
Stewait. That officer, coolly remarking that she was an English frigate, or an Indiaman, directed 
the first lieutenant to beat to quarters, and get ready for action. As soon as this order was given, 
the officer took another good look at the stranger, when he discovered the canvass of two other ves- 
sels rising like bright clouds above the fog-bank, in the same direction. These were evidently men 
of war, and captain Stewart was informed of the fact. He immediately came on deck, and took the 
trumpet. * 

" Gun-deck, there," shouted he, " cut the cable !" 

" Ay, ay, sir !" answered the master's mate, as he cracked away with his axe at Uncle Sam's big 
rope — a hissing sound — a rattling along the ship's side — a smoke, as though a fire was pouring out 
of the hawse-hole — and then the old frigate cast to starboard, and stood out of the roads under her 
three topsails. The prizes followed with promptitude. The north-east trades were blowing freshly 
outside, and the three vessels, catching their influence, passed to sea, about gun-shot to the windward 
&lt;of the hostile squadron, just rounding East Point. A.s the Constitution left the land, she crossed 
her topgallant yards, boarded her tacks, and set all her kites. 



276 

The English prisoners on shore now took advantage of the predicament of their conquerors, and 
most unkindly aimed the guns of the shore battery at them, as they swept swiftly past it. As soon 
as the Americans had gained the weather beam of the enemy, the latter tacked, and the six vessels,. 
Tinder all the canvas that they could show, staggered along to the southward and eastward at the 
rate of 10—6. 

A jieavy fog still lay in fleecy shapes upon the ocean, and concealed the dark and frowning hulls 
of the strangers ; but they were supposed, from their canvas, to be two line of battle ships, and a 
first class frigate. The leeward vessel bore the pennant of the commodoie. 

The frigate weathered upon the American ships in a manner as unusual as it was interesting,- 
gaining on the Levant and Cyane, but falling astern of the Constitution, while the two latter ves- 
sels on the Constitution's lee quarter held way with her. 

The Constitution now cut adrift two boats which she could not hoist in, and walked away from 
the prizes and pursuers, like a cloud upon the breath of the summer gale. Captain Stewart now 
made a signal for the Cyane, the lagging prize, to tack. This order was jjromptly obeyed by lieu- 
tenant Hofiman, the prizemaster, and it was expected that one of the enemy would go about and 
pursue her, but in this captain Stewart was disappointed. 

The Cyane, finding that the enemy did not pursue her, stood on towards the south until she was 
lost in the fog, when lieutenant Hoffinan tacked again, anticipating that the enemy might chase him 
to leeward. This skillful and prudent ofiicer kept to windward long enough to allow the enemy to 
get ahead should they pursue him, and then he squared away for the United States, and arrived safely 
at Ne'.v York, on the 10th of April following. 

The three ships of the enemy continued to chase the Constitution and Levant. As the vessels 
left the land, the fog thinned, until it showed captain Stewart the force of the enemy, which wa&amp; 
stated by the English officers to consist of the Leander, -50, Sir George Collier ; the Newcastle, 50^* 
Lord George Stewart ; and the Acasta, 40, captain Kerr. They eventually proved to be those ves-- 
sels, which were cruising for the President, Peacock, and Hornet. At 2g, P. M., the officers of the 
Newcastle were seen standing upon her hammock-cloths. She now began to fiie by divisions, and 
through the low fog bank the flashes of her guns proclaimed her force. Her shot struck the water 
within one hundred yards of the Constitution. At 3, P. M., the Levant having fallen some distance 
astern, captaiji Stewart made the signal for her to tack. Lieutenant Ballard, the prize oflicer, prompt- 
ly obeyed the signal, and in seven minutes afterwards, the English vessels tacked by signal, and 
chased the prize, leaving the Constitution bowhng along in her majesty, in a contrary direction, at 
the rate of eleven knots per hour. 

The Levant ran into port, and was retaken. Captain Stewart, however, kept on his course, arid 
after landing his prisoners at Maranham, and learning at Porto Rico that peace had been made be- 
tween the United States and Great Britain, he proceeded for New York, where he arrived in the 
middle of May, 1815 

The Constitution had been in three actions, was twice critically chased, and had captured five ves- 
sels of war in the short space of two years and three quarters. Her losses in men, and her injuries 
in body, were trivial. She was always well commanded ; and in her two last cruises, she had supe- 
rior crews — hardy New Englandets, who were able to fight a ship without officers — men who had 
braved the icy perils of the north, and who had dared to put a hook in the mouth of Leviathan him- 
self. Laid up to rot in glory, we now leave her for a time. Reader, her battle cruize is over. " Haul 
down the colors !" 



BEREAVEMENT 



When- some Beloveds, 'neath whose eyelids lay 
The sweet lights of my childhood, one by one 
Did leave me dark before the natural son, 
As I astonished fell, and could not pray ; 
A thought within me to myself did say, 
"Is God less God, that thou art mortal-sad ] 
Rise, worship, bless Him ! in this sackcloth clad 



As in that purple !" — But I answer, nay ! 
What child his fihal heart in words conveys. 
If him for very good his father choose 
To smite ? What can he, but with sobbing breath 
Embrace th' unwilling hand which chasteneth? 
And my dear Father, thinking fit to bruise. 
Discerns in silent tears, both prayer and praise. 



A CHAPTER 



FIE 






SPCJRTS AND MANLY PASTIMES; 



BY AN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONER. 



T H E GAME OF CRICKET. 



It is a matter to be regretted by all true lovers of tlie manly pastimes that this noble and invigor- 
ating game has never been introduced amona; us here in America ; for it certainly never has been — 
at least to any extent, or in a proper spirit. In England, it has long been a favorite amusement with, 
all classes of society ; with the highest of the aristocracy not less than with the populace. Indeed,, 
its fascinations have been so great that all orders are fiequently seen commingling in the same' 
game ; the nobility giving up prejudice for the nonce in its behalf, and making no sciuple of con- 
tending, in its stirring excitements, with the poorest yeomen of the land. 




Of all the athletic exercises, no^one, perhaps, presents so fine a scope for bringing into full and' 
constant play the qualities both of the mind and body, as that of cricket. A man who is essentially 
stupid will not make a fine cricketer ; neither will he who is not essentially active. He must be 
active in all his faculties — he must be active in mind to prepare for every advantage ; and active irr 
eye and limb, to avail himself of those advantages. He must be cool- tempered, and in the best sense 
of the term, manly,- for he must be able to endure fatigue, and to make light of pain — since, like 
all athletic sports, cricket is not unattended with danger, resulting from inattention and inexpe- 
rience. The accidents, however, attendant upon the players at cricket commonly arise from un- 
watchfulness, or slowness of eye. A short-sighted person is as unfit to become a cricketer, as one- 



!278 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

deaf would be to discriminate the most delicate gradations and varieties in tones; added to which 
he must be in constant jeopardy of serious injury. 

This noble game is thoroughly British. The derivation of its name is probably from the Saxon 
cryce, (a stick.) Strutt, however, in his " Sports and Pastimes,"' states that he can find no record 
of the game under its present appellation " beyond the commencement of the last century, where it 
occurs in one of the songs published by D'Urfey." The first four lines of" Of a noble race was Shekin," 
run thus : 

" Her was the prettiest fellow 
At foot ball or at cricket, 
At hunting chase, or nimble race. 
How featly her could prick it." 

The same historian of British games doubts not that cricket derived its origin from the ancient 
game of club-ball, the patronymics of which being compounded of Welsh and Danish (clwppa and 
bol) do not warrant his conclusion, the Saxon being an elder occupant of Great Britain. Fiom the 
circumstance, however, of there being no illustration extant — no missal illuminated with a group 
engaged in this king of athletic games, as is the case with its plebeian brother, the club-ball ; also 
from its constitution being of a more civil and complicated character, we may rationally infer that it 
is the offspring of a more polite, at all events of a maturer age, than its fellow. The game of club- 
ball appears to have been no other than the present well known cat-aiid-ball, which, with similar 
laws and customs prescribed in the playing at it, was doubtless anterior to trap-ball. The trap, in- 
deed, carries with it an air of refinement in " the march of mechanism." 

They who are acquainted with some of the remote and unfrequented villages of England, where 
the primitive manners, customs, and games of our ancestors survive in the perfection of rude and 
unadulterated simplicity, must have remarked the lads playing at a game which is the same in its 
outline and principal features as that " cricket," which is, to day, the pride and glory of the English 
athlete. We mean the game in which a single stick is appointed for the wicket, ditto for a bat, and 
ditto, of about three inches in length, for a ball. If this be not the original of the game of cricket, it 
is at least a plebeian imitation of it. 

The constitution of the pastime has undergone considerable alteration and improvement since be- 
coming a fashionable and favorite recreation. We proceed to give the necessary analysis of the 
game, with the proper instructions for playing, being forced to reserve for another number " The laws 
of the game, as revised by the London Marylebjne Club." 

QUALIFICATIONS OF A GOOD PLAYER. 

One who intends to cut any figure as a cricket player should be active, and capable of enduring 
fatigue. He should not be afiaid of his person, nor tmrid about catching a ball when at its speed. 
He should have a clear head, and a quick eye and hand, and above all be cool and collected, all 
nerve or none at all. A batsman who " flutters" or flurries himself in the least, had better throw 
Ms bat down at once and walk out to save time, for he cannot do any good in, and may do harm 
by getting out the other in-player. 

If we had to choose play eis by sight, without knowing any thing of their qualifications, we would 
stick to what the doctors call the sanguine, and avoid the heavy lymphatic, or the dark bilious look- 
ing subject ; a light complexion and a clear blue eye, with a firm elastic step for us. 

If it be the lot of the reader to join in any match at home or from home, let us advise him to stick 
to the old motto, " early to bed aird early to rise." Let him shun all larks except those that he can 
hear in the fields in a summer's morning ; racketing at night gives him the palsy next day. 

A cricket club, to make sure of your number for private matches, should consist of twenty-eight 
or thirty members at least ; for, taking away two for umpires, and two for scorers, you may gener- 
ally calculate upon one or two absent from sickness or other causes. 

BATS, BALLS, ETC. 

The bat now in general use is made of willow, wrapped in the handle with silk or thread so as to 
give good hold ; it must not exceed four inches and a quarter in the widest part, and must not be 
more than thirty-eight inches in length. 

The ball is made of stout leather, strongly sewed ; for regular play, the weight must not be less 
than five ounces and a half; for boys we should recommend a lighter ball, the regular weight is too 
much for their strength. 

The stumps are six pieces of wood, three of which are to be placed in the ground at a point fixed 
upon, and the other three at another point, twenty-two yards distant. On the top of these stumps 
is placed a piece of wood, eight inches long, called a bail. The stumps should be twenty-seven 
inches above the ground, and the bail so placed that a touch will knock it off. 



THE GAME OF CRICKET. 279 

BOWLING CREASE. 

This is a mark made on the ground at each wicket. It must be in a line with the stumps, .six 
feet eight inches long, with the stumps in the centre; ihere must be a return crease turning towards 
the bowler, at right angles. 

POPPING CREASE. 

This is a mark made on the ground, four feet from the wicket, and parallel to it ; the length is 
not limited, but it must not be shorter than the bowling crease. 

SCORERS. 

The scorers keep an account of the runs to each striker separately for each innings, the side that 
has obtained the greatest number of runs wins the game. When the players on each side have all 
been in and out once, the first innings is completed ; it is usual to have another innings, unless one 
party is beaten into sulkiness. 

NUMBER OF PLAYERS. 

Cricket is played by twenty-two persons, eleven on each side, and two umpires, with two persons 
to score and count. Thirteen players play at once, viz : the eleven oqtside players, and the two 
strikers, who are of the in-party. This is the number required for a full game, but for practice, a 
less number is sufficient; it is, however, advisable to have the full number, where it is possible, for 
the sake of teaching every one his duty. 

CHOICE OF THE GROUND. ' 

Where the players have not a regular ground, they should choose the smoothest and flattest piece 
of ground they can meet with, where there is plenty of room for the disposition of all the forces. 
The wickets should be pitched where there are no inequalities to divert the ball froxi its course, at 
the distance and at the height hereafter stated in the rules. 

UMPIRES. 

The next point is the choice of umpires, with whom rests the decision of all disputed points, and 
from whom there is no higher appeal, not even the House of Representatives. As this is an office 
of considerable importance and responsibility, care should be taken to choose men who are well 
qualified by a perfect knowledge of the game, and whose characters guarantee that their decision is 
impartial. One should stand somewhat behind the striker's wicket, so as to have a full view of the 
players, without interfering with their play. The other should place himself immediately behind 
the bowler's wicket, where he can see if the striker stop the bowl with his foot. 

DISPOSITION OF THE PLAYERS. 

The players should be stationed according to the plate ; their particular duties are described here- 
after. Should the striker be left-handed, it will be necessary to change their position, placing them 
on the left side, in exactly the same order. 

I.— THE STFvIKEKS. 

The strikers belong to the in-party. Their first look out should be to keep themselves in ; their 
next, to obtain as many runs as they can for their party ; to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket, 
and to play it where it is least likely to be caught by the other side. The position of the striker 
should be with one foot behind the popping crease, leaving the wicket clear of all obstruction from 
foot or knees. The feet should be as wide apart as you can place them without losing your full 
*' purchase," one immediately in front of the other, and the toss rather pointing towards the bowler; 
the weight of the body should be on the right leg, the top of your bat inclined towards the bowler, 
and the left elbow, as Nyren says, should be kept "well up."' The value of Nyren's maxim will 
be discovered by all who attempt to play ; it may be found rather awkward at first, but " use is se- 
cond nature," and it is the only position which will give the requisite command over the balls. With 
regard to the manner of striking at different balls, practice and a quick eye and hand arc the surest 
guides. 

The in-player who is not striking should always he prepared for running. He should stand be- 
fore the popping crease, and as soon as the ball is delivered he may run, but should not follow too 



280 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

far, for should no runs be obtained he may be put out. Should the players have crossed each other, 
and a wicket be put down, he who is running to that wicket is out. In running from one wicket 
to the other, the strikers should take care not to run against each other, and should carry the bat out- 
side. Should the striker leave his place before the ball is delivered, the bowler may knock down his 
wicket. 

II.— THE BOWLER. 

The bowler belongs to the out-party. His position is immediately behind the wicket ; and his 
duty to bowl the ball so that it may knock down the wicket, or so that the striker may play at it in 
the least advantageous manner. 

The ball should be held so that the tops of the fingers shall cross the seam ; this gives certainty 
to the hold. It should hot be grasped too tightl_y, nor yet too loose]}^ but just so that you may let 
it leave the hand freely, and still have perfect control over it; the body should be kept in an erect 
position. It must be delivered with one foot behind the bowling crease, and within the return crease, 
and with the back of the hand towards the ground. The hand must not be raised above the shoul- 
der. The aim of the bowler should be to drop his ball at distances of from three to five yards from 
the wicket, according as he wants a slow or fast ball. The speed of the ball must be regulated by 
the play of the striker, and the manner of bowling frequently varied with the same player, otherwise 
where the striker has " got into" your favorite ball, it will be a difBcult matter to bowl him out. 

In case the bowler should not succeed in bowling out the striker, and does not drop the ball in the 
light place, it is advisable to have some signal, known only to the two bowlers, by which either may- 
be directed where to throw his balls, or how to vary them so as to be least advantageous to the stri- 
ker. 

As there are very fejv players who have not a favorite ball, the bowler will do well to find this out 
as soon as maj^ be, and avoid giving him it. After hitting a few balls a striker will very often get 
so thoroughly into the bowler's way that it is a difficult matter to move him. In these cases it is ad- 
visable to change the bowler, even if it be only for a time. Bad bowling that a striker does not un- 
derstand will often be more effective than good bowling which he is thoroughly up to. 

Should the ball be hit by the striker, the bowler must return to his wicket, and hold himself in 
readiness in the best position to catch the ball if it be thrown up to hirn. 

ni.— THE WICKET KEEPEE. 

His duty is to stump out the striker if he should leave his place to meet the ball, and to hold him- 
self in readiness to put him out, if the ball is thrown up to him. 

IV.— POINT. 

He should stand to the right of the striker, and within the popping crease, so as not to interfere 
with short slip. He should vary the distance between him and the striker from four to seven yards,, 
according as he may judge the ball will be a full one or a slow one. 

v.— LONG STOP. 

He must take his station at some distance behind the wicket-keeper ; his duty is to stop or bring 
in all the balls that have passed the striker or the wicket-keeper. 

VI.— SHORT SLIP. 

His station is a few feet from the wicket-keeper, and rather behind him ; he is required to " keep 
his eyes open," and to lend whatever assistance he can to the wicket-keeper, in stopping the balls, 
or in taking his place at the wicket, should he leave it to follow a ball. 

* 
VII.— LONG SLIP. 

He must stand about twelve or fifteen ygrds from the striker, covering the ground between point 
and short slip. 

VIII.— LEG. 

He should stand somewhat behind the line of the popping crease, varying his distance accoiding 
as the capabilities or play of the striker may direct him. 



CHILDHOOD. 

IX.— COVERPOINT. 



281 



He should take his station on the off-sid^, a short distance behind point, so as to stop any balls 
that may be missed by him ; also to assist middle wicket if need be. 

X.— MIDDLE WICKET. 

"^ He should stand on the offside at a moderate distance from the wicket of the bowler ; should the 
bowlei require to leave his wicket to follow a ball, middle wicket should take his place. 

XL— LONGFIELD OFF. 

His station is at some distance from the bowler, so as to cover bowler and middle wicket, and to 
stop long balls. 

XII.— LONGFIELD ON. 

He should stand about the same distance on the right of the bowler, as longfield is on the left. 

XIIL— UMPIRES. 

One should stand somewhat behind the striker's wicket, the other immediately behind the bowler's 
wicket. Their duties are numerous and important, and will be found at length in the rules. 



SINGLE WICKET. 

Single wicket is played by any number from one to six on each side. If there are less than five 
players, bounds are placed twenty-two yards distant on each side, in a line from the off and leg 
stump ; and no run can be counted unless the ball bo hit before the bounds; nor can the striker hit 
the ball unless one of his feet be on the ground, and behind the popping crease. 

The out-playeis must return the ball so as to cross the ground between the striker's and the bowl- 
er's wicket ; the striker may run until it is so returned. 

When the ball is hit, the striker must run to the bowler's wicket and strike off the ball, and back 
to his own wicket before he can count one; if he attempt a second run, he must touch the bowler's 
wicket and turn before the ball has crossed the play, or he is not entitled to another notch. If there 
are more than four players, no bounds are required. The laws relating to the bowler, and the du- 
ties of the out-party, are the same as at double wicket. 

The great distance which the striker has to run in playing single wicket has always been an ob- 
jection; and some modification should be made. 



CHILDHOOD. 



BT THOMAS K. HOFLASD 



P H I X A D 



How beautiful is childhood 

In its young and careless glee ! 
The sunshine of its merry smile 

Is a pleasant thing to see. 
I would not trust the man who feels 

Within his heart no bliss, 
When childhood chngeth to his knee. 

And claims the playful kiss. 

For me it ever hath a charm — 

Its glad and happy tone 
Seems to reflect upon my soul 

The brightness of its own ; 



And, when its soft and rosy lips 
Warm to my cheek are pressed, 

I think, of all God's precious gifts, 
Sure childhood is the best. 

Oh, may I ever keep undimmed 

This feeling on my heart ; 
From none of earth's most treasured oys 

More should I grieve to part ; 
For weary, sad, and desolate, 

Will be this world to me. 
When I can think or look upon 

Sweet childhood carelessly. 



REVIEW OF N E W BOOKS 



Shaks'peare and His Friends,- or, " The Golden Age" of Merry England. Three volumes. Lea 

and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

Messieurs Lea and Blanchard have done a pubUc service in reprinting this work, which will com- 
mend itself to all classes of readers, and should be procured forthwith by every person who has a 
copy ot Shakspeare, (that is to say, by the world at large,) as a most valuable running commentary 
upon the writings of the immortal bard, as well as those of his contemporaries. Most of the illus- 
trious spirits of the '• golden age" figure in the pages with a remarkably well sustained life-likeliness ; 
the principal, if not the sole design of the author, indeed, being the crowding into a connected nar- 
rative as many as possible of these worthies — with a view of depicting them by aid of the best lights 
of histoiical research. This difficult task is well performed — and the book requires no higher praise. 
"We make objection, however, to the author's imbuing his oivii style — the words in which he per- 
sonally speaks — with the antique spirit of the people and period discussed. 



The Canons of Good Breedijig ,- or, The Handbook of the Man of Fashion. By the Author of 
the " LaiL's of Etiquette." Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

This little book is a curiosity in its way. Indeed, there is something so very singular about it 
that we have been led to read it through deliberately and thoughtfully, with the view of solving the 
mystery which envelops it. It is by the author of t!ie " Laws of Etiquette," who is also the author 
of " Advice to a Young Gentleman," a volume which W'C commended with some warmth in a for- 
mer number of the Magazine. 

In regard to the " Canons of Good Br-eeding," the critical reader, who takes it up, will, of course, 
be inclined to throw it aside with contempt, upon perceiving its title. This will be his first impulse. 
If he proceed so far, however, as to skim over the Preface, his eye will be arrested by a certain air 
of Iderature-ism (we must be permitted to coin an odd word for an odd occasion) which pervades 
and invigorates the pages. Eegarding wiih surprise this discrepancy between preface and title — be- 
tween the apparent polish of the one, and the horribly ad captandum character of the other — he 
■will be induced to finish the perusal of the book, and, we answer for it, will be thoroughly mystified 
before he gets well to the end. He will now find an exceeding difficulty, nearly amounting to im- 
possibility, in making up his mirid in regard to the merit or demerit of the work. If, hov/ever, he 
be somewhat in a hurry, there can be little doubt that he will terminate his examination with a hearty, 
perhaps even an enthusiastic, approval. 

The truth is that the volume abounds in good things. We rnay safely say that, in a compass so 
small, we never before met with an equal radiancy of fine wit, so well commingled with scholar-like 
observation and profound thought — thought sometimes luminously and logically, and always ele- 
gantly, expressed. The first difficulty arising in the mind of the critic is that these good things are 
suspiciously super-ahundant. He will now pass on to the observation of some inaccuracies of adap- 
tation. He will then call to mind certain niaiseries of sentiment altogeiher at warfare with the pre- 
vailing tone of the book — and, finally, he will perceive, although with somewhat greater difficulty, 
the evidence of a radical alteration and bepatching of the language — the traces of an excessive limcte 
labor. He will thus take otTence at the disingenuousness which has entrapped him into momentary 
applause ; and, while he cannot deny that the work, such as the world sees it, has merit, he will still 
pronounce it, without hesitation, the excessively-elaborated production of some partially-educated 
man, possessed with a rabid ambition for the reputation of a wit and savant, and who, somewhat 
unscrupulous in the mode of attaining such reputation, has consented to clip, cut, and most assidu- 
ously intersperse throughout his book, by wholesale, the wit, the wisdom, and the erudition, of Ho- 
race Walpole, of Bohngbroke, of Chesterfield, of Bacon, of Burton, and of Burdon, — even of Bul- 
wer and of D'Israeli, — with occasional draughts (perhaps at second-hand) from the lich coffers 
of Seneca, or Machiavelli — of Montaigne, of Rochefoucault, of the author of " La Maniere de bierl 
penser," or of Bielfeld, the German who wrote in French "Les Premiers Traits de V Erudition

Universelle." We may be pardoned also for an allusion — which is enougjh — to such wealthy store- 
houses as the " Letlres Edifiantes et Curieuses," ihe Literary Memoirs of Sallengi-e, the " Melan- 
ges Literaircs," of Suard and Andre, and the " Pieces Interressantes et peu Connues" of La Place. 

The construction here given is the most obvious, and indeed the only one, which can be put upon 
the volume now befoie us, and upon the other efforts of the same pen. They betray the hand of 
the diligent adaptator of others' wit, rather than the really full mind of the educated and studious 
man of general letters. True eruditiois — by which term we here mean simply to imply much diver- 
sified reading — is certainly discoverable — is positively indicated — only in its ultimate and total re- 
sults. The mere grouping together of fine things from the greatest multiplicity of the rarest works, 
or even the apparently natural inweaving into any composition, of the sentiments and manner of 
these works, is an attainment within the reach of every moderately-informed, ingenious, and not in- 
dolent man, having access to any ordinary collection of good books. The only available objection 
to what we have urged will be based upon the polish of the style. But we have already alluded to 
traces of the Itmae labor — and this labor has been skilfully applied. Beyond doubt, the volume has 
undergone a minute supervision and correction by some person whose habits and education have 
rendered him very thoroughly competent to the task. 

We have spoken somewhat at length in regard to the authorship of" The Canons of Criticism," 
because ingenuities of this species are by no means very common. Few men are found weak enough 
to perpetrate them to any extent. We have said httle, however, in respect to the book itself, as it 
stands — and this little has been in its favor. The publication will be read with interest, and may 
he read, generally speaking, with profit. Some of the niaseries to which we alluded just now are 
sufficiently droll — being even oddly at variance with the assumed spirit of the whole work. We 
are told, among other things, that the writer has employed throughout his book the words " ladv," 
and " gentleman," instead of the words '■ woman," and " man," which " are more correct expres- 
sions, and more usual in the best circles," — that " when you lay down your hat in a room, or on a 
bench in a public place, you should put the open part downwards, so that the leather may not be 
seen which has been soiled by the hair," — that " you should never present yourself at a large even- 
ing party without having your hair dressed and curled," — and that since " the inferior classes of 
men, as you may see if you think fit to take notice of them, only press the rim of the hat when 
they speak to women of their acquaintance," you should be careful " when you salute a lady or gen- 
tleman, to take your own entirely off, and cause it to describe a circle of at least ninety degrees." 

The effect of such fine advice can be readily conceived. It will be taken by contraries, as sure as 
dandies have brains. No one of that much-injured race will now venture to say " lady," or " gentle- 
man," or have his hair curled, or place his hat upside-down upon a table, or do any other such un- 
imaginable act, lest he should be suspected of having derived his manners from no better source than 
the " Canons of Good Breeding." We shall have a revolution in such matters — a revolution to be 
remedied only by another similar volume. As for its author — should he write it — we wish him no 
worse fate than to be condemned to its perpetual perusal until such time as he shall succeed in de- 
scribing with his hat one of his own very funny circles — one of those circles of just ninety degrees. 



The Damsel of Darien. By the Author of " The Yemussee" etc. Two volumes. Lea and Blan- 

chard, Philadelphia. 

The author of " The Damsel of Darien" is also the author of " Atalantis, a Story of the Sea ;" 
" Martin Faber, the Story of a Criminal ;" " Guy Rivers, a Tale of Georgia;" " The Partisan, a 
Tale of the Revolution ;" and " Mellichampe, a Legend of the Santee." Of these works, " Martin 
Faber" passed to a second edition, (and well deserved a permanent success,) " Guy Rivers," and 
" The Yemassee," each to a third. What fate " Mellichampe" met with, or what " The Partisan," 
we are not so well prepared to say. In the latter work, with many excellences, were to be found 
very many disfiguring features, and, upon the whole, we thought it hardly worthy the literary repu- 
tation of Mr. Simms. The novel now published is, in our opinion, a much better book ; evincing 
stricter study and care, with a far riper judgment, and a more rigidly-disciplined fancy. The path of 
the writer appears to be still onward — although he proceeds somewhat slowly along that path, to be 
sure. He is thinking of Festina lente, perhaps. We sincerely wish him all the success to which 
his talents entitle him, and which his persevering efforts most assuredly deserve. 

Vasco Nunez de Balboa is the hero of the " Damsel of Daiien ;" and the narrative, which of 
course has no plot, is occupied with his dreams, difficulties, adventures, (and, finally, his death, 
thiough the jealous tynany of Pedraiias,) in the pursuit of that darling object of his heart, the dis- 
covery of the Southern Sea; of which he had obtained some indefinite knowledge from the Indians 
of Darien, during his voyage under Rodrigo de Bastides. As these things aie all matters of history, 
and as Mr. Simms has adheied for the chief part to the ordinary records, it will be unnecessary to 
dwell upon them here. In the first volume we have the most of pure romance ; in the second, more 
of fact. The passages which, as mere specimens of good writing, we prefer, are to be found in the 



284 



BURTONS GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE. 



earliei portion of the story. We might designate the nineteenth and twenty-first chapters (of the 
first volume) as particularly forcible and full of interest. In the former, Vasco Nunez escapes from 
the hand of a matador, through the instrumentality of a Carribbean chief, (Caonabo,) who figures 
largely in the narrative. In the latter, this chief, being captured by two Spaniards for the sake of a 
reward set upon his head, seduces his captors, by promises of hidden treasure, into a chasm among 
the mountains, and entombs them irredeemably by hurling a huge rock upon the aperture through 
which they entered. This is well told, and has an exciting efiect. There are also many other fine 
episodical pieces interspersed throughout the book — which, altogether, is one of value, and cannot 
fail of being favorably received. Still, we should not deny that its chief merit lies in the pertinacity 
of its adherence io fad; and the judicious reader will not be willing to give Mr. Simms exclusive 
credit for that portion of his entertainment which is lefeiable to the chronicles of the men and times 
discussed — for that interest, in short, which, appertaining to the subject itself, is essentially indepen- 
dent of the author. 

Perhaps the following beautiful ballad, which is put into the mouth of the hero, Vasco Nunez, is 
the most really meritorious portion of the book : — 

INDIAN SERENADE. 



'Mong Lucayo's isles and waters, 

Leaping to the evening light. 
Dance the moonlight's silver daughters. 
Tresses streaming, glances gleaming, 
Ever beautiful and bright. 

And their wild and mellow voices. 

Still to hear along the deep. 
Every brooding star rejoices, 
While the billow, on its pillow, 
LuU'd to silence, seems to sleep. 

Yet they wake a song of sorrow, 

Those sweet voices of the night 
Still from grief a gift they boirow, 
And hearts shiver, as they quiver, 
With a wild and sad delight. 

'Tis the wail for life they waken, 
By Samana's yielding shore — 

With the tempest it is shaken ; 

The wide ocean is in motion, 
And the song is heard no more. 



But the gallant bark comes sailing. 
At her prow the chieftain stands, 

He hath heard the tender wailing ; — 

It delights him — it invites him 
To the joys of other lands. 

Bright the moonlight's round and o'er him. 

And ! see, a picture lies 
In the gentle waves before him — 
Woman smiling, still beguiling. 

With her dark and lovely eyes. 

White arms toss above the waters. 
Pleading murmurs fill his ears, 

And the gem of ocean's daughters, 

Love assuring, still alluring. 
Wins him down with tears. 

On, the good ship speeds withoat him, 

By Samana's silver shore — 
They have twined their arms about him. 
Ocean's daughters, in the waters. 

Sadly singing as before. 



The defects of the " Damsel of Darien" are few, and seldom ladical. The leading sin is the sin 
of imitation — the entire absence of originality. This fault is especially seen in the manner — which, 
in regard to the greater portion of the narrative, could not be made by the caricaturist more utterly 
common-place than it is. Mr. Simms adheres to the good old-fashioned way of getting at his sub- 
jects, and of handling them when attained. Every sentence puts us in mind of something we have 
heard similarly said before. This imitation is also perceptible in higher particulars. It pervades 
even the headings of his chapters — which are all Bulwerized. It extends to his characters. If Fe- 
lipe Davila is not an humble follower of the old Jew in Ivanhoe, then what is he 1 " And thou 
thinkest, worthy Micei Codro, that the fortune of the brave youth is good, albeit he doth reject the 
offer of Enciso 1 Will the stars keep faith with him that is so obstinate 1 It were beggary to me, 
worthy Micer, should the castillanos — seven hundred and fifty — " etc., etc. The tone and material 
of all the astrological portion of the story is awkwardly adopted from '• Godolphin." We say awk- 
wardly ; for, in that fervidly poetical tale, the predictions of the star-gazer not only work out their 
own fulfilment, but are in accurate keeping with the dream-like character of the whole fiction. Be- 
sides, the astrological rant of old Micer Codro, in the " Damsel of Darien," puts us constantly in 
mind of the " hi presto .'" twaddle of Signor Blitz. 

Mr. Simms is now and then guilty of a grossness of thought and expression which indicates any 
thing but refinement of mind. We spoke of this matter at some length in a review, elsewhere, of 
the " Partisan," and we speak of it now because we would particularly call the author's attention to 
the subject. By grossness of expression we do not mean indelicacy — but the expression of images 
which repel and disgust. xAt page 59, vol. I., for example, the novelist dwells too unequivocally upon 
the horrid barbarities inflicted upon the Indians by Jorge Garabito. At page 195, we read — "The 
sabueso has no keener scent for his victim, and loves not better to snuff up the thick blood with his

noslrUd." And at page 219, wliat can be in worse taste than such a phrase as — " I will advance to 
the short banyan that stands within the path, and my dagger shall yj/c/i his teeth, ere he gels round 
it." The most curious instance, however, oi' out author's penchant for such things as these, occurs 
at page 98 of the same volume, where, amid a passage of great beauty, he pauses to quote from the 
Siege of Corinth, the well known image about '• peeling the fig when the fruit is fresh" — an image 
whose disgusting application where it originally stands has been often made the subject of severe 
and very justifiable censure. 

The style of our novehst has improved of late — but is still most faulty. The Dedication to Mr. 
Paulding needs no comment from us. Every one who either writes or reads at all will pronounce 
it a disgraceful piece of composition. Never was any thing so laboriously bad. I'he whole work, 
indeed, abounds with awkward or positively ungrammatical phrases — but we shall be satisfied with 
pointing out merely one or two. 

Page 17, vol. I. — " He was noted for his vigor and address in jousts and tilting matches, was un- 
surpassed in feats of horsemanship, and — an accomplishment not less attractive among his admirers — 
a most capital musician." Here a musician and a compliment are placed in apposition. 

At page 123, we read thus — " This was spoken by Ojeda while at some little distance from, and 
■while the crowd stood, a solid mass, between him and his rival." Here the sentence is to be tor- 
tured into grammar only by placing in a parenthesis the Words " and while the crowd stood a solid 
mass between him and." But how easily might it have been written that " Ojeda said this while 
the crowd stood, a solid mass, between himself and his rival, whose position was at some little dis- 
tance from liis own." 

Again, at page 59, vol. I. — " Women, who are very foolish, are apt to be very cruel." In this 
equivocal sentence, Mr. iS., no doubt, intended to assert that very foolish women are apt to^be very 
cruel. His words as they stand, however, convey a really serious charge of stupidity against the 
gentle sex at large. These faulty constructions, occurring at every page, not only offend the eye of 
the critic, and lessen the authority of the writer, but have an exceedingly large influence in marring 
the beauty of sentiment, by rendering abortive all vigor of thought. 

In another point of view Mr. S. has committed certain blunders, or fallen into certain inadver- 
tences, which it might be as well to remedy in a second edition. The whole account of the hurri- 
cane is, we think, monstrously at war with all the dicta of common sense, as well as all the known 
principles of Natural Philosophy. The writer discourses of the storm as he would of a wild beast; 
and the reader cannot get over the idea that Mr. S. actually supposes it to be something which pos- 
sesses an existence independent of that atmosphere, of which it is merely a quality er condition. 

At page 161, of the same volume, we find these words — •' And how natural, in an age so fanci- 
ful, to believe that the stars and starry groups beheld in the new world for the first time by the na- 
tive of the old, were especially assigned for its government and protection !" Now if by the old 
world be meant the East, and by the new wor-ld the West, we are quite at a loss to know what are 
the stars seen in the one, which cannot be equally seen in the other. 

Some singular instances of bad taste (instances of a different character from those above noted) 
are also observable in the " Damsel of Darien," bat we cannot now attempt to indicate them in de- 
tail. There is a ludicrous example, however, which it will not do to pass by, and which occurs at 
page 105 of the first volume. '• It was a pile of the oyster," says Mr. S., " vihich yielded the pre- 
cious pearls of the South, and the artist had judiciously painted some with their lips parted, and 
showing within the large precious fruit in the attainment of which Spanish cupidity had already 
proved itself capable of every peril as well as of every crime. The intention of the artist was of 
much more merit than his execution. At once true and poetical no comment could have been more 
severe upon the national character than that conveyed in this shght design." Now we can have no 
doubt in the world that the artist was a clever fellow in his way — but it is really difRcull to conceive 
what kind of poetical hsauty that can be, which Mr. Simms is so happy as to discover in the coun- 
tenance of a gaping oyster. 



Father Butler and The Lough Deary Pilgrim. By W. H. Carleton, Author of " Traits and 
Stories of Irish Peasantry" " Neal Malone," etc. To which is added National Tales. By 
Thomas Hood, authm- of" The Comic Annual" etc. Two Volumes. T. K. and P. G. Collins, 
Philadelphia. 

W. H. Carleton has won no little reputation by " Neal Malone," but his "Traits and Stories of 
the Irish Peasantry" are scarcely as entertaining as those of Mrs. Hall. " Father Butler" is a good 
story, and " The Lougli Deary Pilgrim" has a very passable degree of merit. 

In regard to Thomas Hood, it might be thought scarcely necessary to say a word. In that way 
which he has m.ade so peculiarly his own, he is certainly " alone in his glory."' Most of his stories 
in the book now before us, however, are of a serious character ; and we know of nothing serious — 
at least in prose — which has hitherto proceeded from his pen. He appears to have had some mis- 



286 burton's gentleman's magazine. ^ 

givings in making this novel attempt; and we really think he should not have made it at all. His first 
tale, " The Spanish Tragedy," has some excellent points about it, although decidedly bad as a whole ; 
the rest are ail miserable trash. The truih is, we scarcely know how to think, or how to speak, of 
what he has here given to the world. The preface would lead us to regard the pieces as original ; 
which they positively are not. The leading ideas of every article, if not the very words which con- 
vey them, are as familiar to us as any old song. Moreover, the language, the subject, the general 
air and manner of the narratives are so strongly marked, that we have no hesitation in pronouncing 
them all either intentional, aud in that case exceedingly well-managed, imitations of Italian novel- 
leitos, or disingenuous translations from the same. 



Nan Barrell ; or The Gipsey Mother. By the Author of " The Heir ess,'' " The Merchant's 
Daughter," " The Squire," " The Prince and The Pedlar," etc. Two Volumes. Carey and 
Hart, Philadelphia. 

"The Prince and The Pedlar" is better known to American readers than the other productions 
of its authoi — if we except some minor pieces published in British periodicals. " The Heiress," 
we believe, was quite popular among ns — at all events it deserved popularity. " Nan Darrell" is a 
better book than either of these two, and may well stand a comparison with any modern novel of 
its class and character. It is exceedingly well written and is full of a rich imaginative interest which 
will make its way with certainty into the hearts of the ardent and the young. Its pathos is parti- 
cularly noticeable. 



The Violet : A Christmas and, New Year's Present. 1840. Edited by Miss Leslie. Carey and 

Hart, Philadelphia. 

This little annual is somewhat smaller in form, and less in cost, than " The Gift," but scarcely 
less excellent in its literary contents. The Hst of contributors will speak for itself. We have, among 
others. Miss Leslie, the editor; Miss Waterman; Miss Gould; Mrs. Sigoumey ; Mrs. Embury; 
Mrs. Stowe and Miss Beecher. The embellishments are also capital. The Frontispiece — " Childhood," 
engraved by Pease, from a drawing by that most exquisitely poetical artist, Fanny Corbeaux — will 
be sure to please every one. There is also a laughable sketch, in a slight way, from a design by 
Meadows, entitled the " Spoiled Child." The best thing in the book is, nevertheless, an engraving 
by Lawson from a pictuie by Webster — the subject an ancient schoolmistress with her pupils. This 
illustrates a story called Dick Davis, by Miss Leslie — a good story told in her usual very excellent 
manner. 



The Literary Souvenir. A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1840. Edited by Wm. E. 
Burton, Esq. E. L. Carey and A. Hart, Philadelphia. 

We seize the opportunity afforded by Mr. Burton's absence in Baltimore, to say a word or two in 
behalf of this annual, which is certainly one of the very best of its race. Its outward appearance is 
lather substantial and elegant, than showy, but its internal merits are all great. The paper is very 
supeib, the typography of an unusually neat character, the embellishments numerous and good. 
The literary contents are fro:n the pens of Mr. Burton and Mr. C. W. Thomson exclusively^the 
prose by the former, the poetry by the latter. Mr. Thomson's articles sustain his reputation. Mr. 
Burton's assuredly do him great credit. We should like nothing better than to speak of them one 
by one — but are bound to refrain. We will say, however, that the " -Eronaut's Revenge, a Tale 
of the Confessional," is a well conceived and well managed story of exceeding interest, and gives 
evidence of very lofty capacity in its author.

A CAPE CODDER AMONG THE MERMAIDS. 



BT Ti'IllIAM E. BURTOIf. 



Do I Ij'Ieve in the sea sarpint 1 You might as well ax me if I b'leved in the compass or thought 
the log could lie. I've never seed the critter myself, cos I haint cruised in them waters as he locates 
himself in, not since I staited on my first voyage in the Confidence whaler, Capting CofHng ; but I 
recking I've got a brother as hails from Nahant, what sees him handsome every year, and knows the 
latitude and longitude o' the beast jest as well as I knows the length o' the futtock shrouds 6' the 
foretop. Brother Zac's pretty cute, and kalkilates from actil observation how much the sarpint 
grows every year — and then he gets siferin', and iiggerin', and reckonin', till he makes out how 
tarnal long it took the sarpint to extensify himself to that almighty size — olTerin' to prove that the 
critter was one o' theur ar' creepin' things what commodore Noah took into his boat at that ar' big 
rain as the Bible tells on — and prehaps, as Zac says, he is the laal, original, etarnal, sarpint as got 
the weather-gage of Mrs. Eve, and gammoned her to lay piratical hands on her husband's stocks of 
apples jest as he was gettiii' his cider fixens ready in the fall. And, by gauly, old fellers, there aint 
nothin' agin natur in that yarn, nyther — for brother Zac says, he can prove that that ar' sarpint 
must have partaking o' the Tree o' Life as growed in the garding of Eding, afore them first squat- 
ters what had located themselves tliar', was driv' off by the angel Gabriel for makin' free with the 
governor's trees. Well, there was a nigger as I know'd once down south, mongst them cotting 
plantashings — and this here darkey used to get his rum aboard rayther stiff — so, one night, havin' 
stowed away a soakin' cargo, he found the navigashing pretty considerable severe, and arter tackin* 
larbord and starbord, makin' short legs to winderd, and long uns to lewerd, he missed stays, and 
brought up in a ditch. While the darkey was lettin' off the steam, and snorin' himself sober, a mud 
tortle, abeout the size of our capting's eppilitts, crawls right slick into his open mouth, and wriggles 
stret down into his innerds. Waell, the nigger felt the effects o' too much tortle to his dying day — 
and that's the case, I guess, with the sarpint — for havin' fed in his infancy on the fruit o' the tree 
o' life, he was obligated to keep on iivin' ever arter, and can't die no now he can fix it. x\nd so he 
keeps on a gettin' longer every week, like a purser's account, and nobody can't guess what for, 
nyther. (' 

Did you ever see a marmaid 1 Waell, then, I recking you'd best shut up, cos I have— and many |; 

on 'era ; and marmen too, and marmisses, and marmasters, of all sizes from babbies not bigger nor ;: 

mackerels to regler six-feeters, with starns like a full-grow'd porpus. I've been at a marmaid's tea | 

party, and arter larnin' the poor ignorant scaly critters how to splice the main-bsace, I left the hull iji 

bilin' on 'em blazin' drunk. You see when our craft was cruisin' up the Arches, we cast anclior f

one mornin' in pretty deep water jest abreast of a small green island as was'nt down in the chart, and 
had'nt got no name nyther. But our capting know'd what he was arter abeout as right as nine- 
pence, cos a small skewner came along side pretty sune, freighted with brandy and wine for the 
officers, what they'd ordered for their own private stores. Waell, the slings were run up to theeend 
of the main-yard, and the waisters were busy hoistin' up the barrels, when a cask o' brandy slipped 
from the slings, as it was being canted round, and dropped right splash into the sea, sinkin' right 
away. Upon 'zaminationing the manifest, it proved to be the best cask o' biandy in the skewner, 
imported from Boardo direct for the capting himself. He raised a pretty muss, I guess, right off the 

reel. '• You d etarnal lazy suckers," said he, " look here ! take all the boats' anchors, lash 'em 

together in tews so as to form grapnels o' four pints each, and drag all abeout here for that ai' 
biandy — and mind you find it, oi I'll put every mother's son of you on short allowance o' rye for 
the next month." 

Waell, the boats was ordered out, and a gropin' we went. I was ordered into the jolly, with Sy 
Davis and Pete Slinks, and a middy to direct. The middy was a pretty considerable smart fellow, 
and jest as he was putUn' off, he nodded up to the chapling as was leanin' over the side, and says 
" What say you to an hour's float upon this here glassy seal" The parsing was down by the man 
Topes in a minnit, and off we sot a fishin' for the brandy-tub. 

The current run pretty slick by the side of the leetle island, and the second luff, who was in the 
cutter, ordeied us to go ahead, and watch along the shore jest to see if the tub warn't rolled up 
there by the tide. We pretended to look right hard for the tub, till we made the lee o' the island, 
and then if we did'nt resolve to take it easy and run the nose o' the jolly into the yaller sand o' the 
shore, there aint no snakes. I held on in the starn by the grapnel, and the parsing pulled out of 
his pocket a good sized sample bottle o' the new stuff as he'd jest bought, and wanted the middy to 
taste — and arter passin' their ideas on the licker, the chapling gave us men a pretty stiff horn a 
piece, now I tell jo\i — and first rate stuff it was I swow. It iled the parsing's tongue like all out 
doors — it took him to talk — all abeout the old original anteek names o' the islands that laid in spots 
all abeout thar' — classic ground, as he called it, and a pretty yarn he did spin tew. He talked abeout 
the island of Candy, whar' the sweetest gals was in all creation or any whar' else — and of a great 
chief called Molasses who killed a one-eyed giant of a blacksmith, named Polly Famous, by spitting 
in his eye — and abeout a fireman named Henearus, who carried out an old man, one Ann Kysis, on 
his shoulders when his house was a fire ; for you see many o' them old Grecian men had wimming's 
names, and wisey warsey tew. But what took my cheese was the parsing's tellin' us abeout tew 
fellows as got up the biggest chunk of a fight, and kept right at it for ten years stret out, and all 
abeout a gall named Ellen what skeeted from her moorings, and run off to Paris. Then the par- 
sing tried to pint out the island of Lip Salve, where a she-conjuror, called Sarcy, from her boldness, 
used to keep a hull skeul o' singing girls called Syringes, cos they sucked the sailors ashore and then 
chawed 'em right up like a piece o' sweet cavendish. Then the midd)' who'd been keepin' dark 
and layin' low all this time, show'd his broughten's-up, and let fly a hull broadside at the parsing 
abeout them ar' Syringes and other fabbelus wimming, sich as king Nepching's wife Ann Thiacite 
aad hei she Try-it-ons, and Neer-a-heads, and river galls, right down to marmaids. 

Waell, you see, all this here talk made us dry as thunder — so the chapling said he guessed the 
sun was over the fore-yard, and baled us out another horn o' licker all around. Then he took a 
" spell ho !" at the jawin' tackle, and allowed there was a river in Jarminy, where all oui Dutch 
imegrants hails from, and that a naked gall used to locate herself in a whirlpool, and come up on 
moonshiney nights and sing a hull bookfull o' songs as turned the heads of all the young fellers in 
them parts. 'Waell, reports ruz up as she'd a hull cargo of gold stowed away at the bottom o' the 
■whirlpool, and many a wild young Jarming, seduced by the gall's singin' and hopes o' gold, lept 
into the river, and wam't heerd on never arter. These matters hurt the young gall's kariter, and the 
old folks, who'd always allowed that she was a kind of goddess, began to think that she war'nt the 
clear grit, and the young fellers said her singin' was no great shakes, and that her beauty warn't the 
thing it was cracked up to be. 

There was a famous Gineral who was'nt raised in that section o' the country, but had swapped a 
castle on a mounting in Spain for one o' them ar' water lots near the whirlpool ; he began to find 
himself rayther short o' cash to buy his groceries, and concludin' that he could not dew without a 
leetle whiskey to keep off the aguy, resolved to pay the whiilpool gall a visit, and jest see if he 
could'nt soft soap the young critter out of a leetle rhino. Next full moon, he toitles to the bluff, what 
hung over the bilin' and foamin' river, and jest at eight bells, up ruz the gall, staik naked, a sittin' 
on the white froth o' the whirlin' water, and singin' " Won't you come to my bower what I've 
shaded for you 1" " Waell," says the Gineral, not a bit daunted — says he, " Look here, my gall, 
I mean to eat a lobster salad with you to night, if you promise to behave like a lady, and wo'nt cut 
up no d — d shines." Waell, the gall give her word of honor, and the Gineral dove into the whirl- 
pool, and down they went right slick. Next morning, the Gineral was found to hum, with a sight 
of old gold pieces, bigger round than the top of a 'backer box, and a hull pot full of the tallest kind 
of jewels ; you see, the sojer had carried a small flask of Monongahely in his pocket, and the river 
gall could'nt get over the old rye — tew glasses opened her heart, I guess, and she let the Gineral 



A CAPE CODDER AMONG THE MERMAIDS. 289" 

slip his cable in the mornin' vvilh jest abeout as much gold as he could stow away. Some of his-- 
friends kalkilated us he'd better drop his anchor ihar' again — and there was some talk in the settle- 
ment of forrain' a jynt-stock company foi the purpose of gettin' up all the gold — but the Gineral 
tell'd 'em he guessed he'd got enough for him, and he seed quite enough down thar' not to want to 
go no more ; and refusin' to say what he had seen, or tell 'em how they was to go to work, it kinder 
stopt the jynt-stock company. The river gall she fell quite in love with the gineral right up to the 
hub, and sot on the bilin' water night arter night, singing " Meet me by moonUght alone" — but the 
Gineral said he'd see her d — d lirst afore he trusted her agin — for, says he, " no woman was never 
deceived twice," which riled the river gall like mad, and in revenge she sot the whirlpool a bilin' 
like all creation, as if resolved to keep the neighborhood in hot water. From the sarcumstance of the 
Gineral's gettin' so much gold out o' the river, the Jarmings called it the Rhino, and its been known 
by somethin' like that name ever since. 

When the chapling had expended his yarn, he sarved out another allowance of licker. I recking 
that he was the raal grit for a parsing — always doing as he'd be done by, and practisin' a darned 
sight more than he preached. " Taint Christian like," says he, " to drink by one's self, and a raal 
tar never objects to share his grog with a shipmate." Them's the ginnewine Bunker Hill ^nti- 
ments of spiritual salvashing, and kinder touch the bottom of a sailor's heart ! 

The middy then uncoiled another length o' cable abeout the fabbelus wimming o' the sea, and 
said it were a tarnation pretty idea, that them angels from hewing as ruled the airth should keep 
watch over the treasures o' the water. Then he tailed a yarn consarnin' the captingof a mar chant- 
man as was tradin' in the South Seas, layin' at anchor, becalmed, one Sunday mornin' abeout five 
bells, when a strannge hail was heerd from under the bows o' the craft, and the hands on deck as 
anserd the hail seed somebody in the water with jest his head and arms stickin' out and holdin' on 
to the dolphing-striker. Waell, I guess they pretty soon throw'd him a rope and hauled him aboard, 
and then they seed he was a reglar built marman, one half kinder nigger and 'tother half kinder 
fish, but altogether more kinder fish than kinder nigger. So, as I was tellin' you, they got him 
aboard and he made an ennquerry arter the capting, who come out of his cabing, and the marman; 
made him a first-raie dancin'-skeul bow, and says in ginnyv.ine Enghsh, " Capting, I sorter reckorj 
it aint entered inio your kalkilation as this here is Sabberday, for you've dropped your tatnal big 
anchor right in froiit of our meetin' house door, and I'm d — d if eeny of my folks can go to pray- 
ers." Waell, the capting was rayther taking aback, and the calm, you see, overlayin' him in that 
thar' hot latitude, had sot his back up above a bit ; and beside that, he felt considerable streeked at 
bein' roused out of his mornin' nap for nothin'; so, altogether he felt sorter wolfish, and lookin' at 
the strannger darned savagerous, says " who the hell are you .5" This here speech put the mar- 
man's dander up, for he says right sassy, " I guess I'm appinted Deacon over all the marmans and 
marmaids in these here parts, and I'll jest trouble you to treat me with the respect due teiv a strann- 
ger and a gentleman." Waell, I reckon the capting's ebenezcr loas roused, for he seized hold of a 
harpoon that was layin' on the fowksell, aird hollerd to the marman, " You fishy vaggybund, make 
tracks out o' my ship, you sammony-tailed son of a sea cook, or I'll drive the grains shck through 
your scaly carkiss, I will." Waell, the critter seein' as the capting meant danger, made but one 
flop with its tail, and skeeted over the side o' the ship into the v.-ater. The capting did not weigh 
anchor, nor nothin', only durin' the night the cables was cut by the marman, and the ship drifted 
on tew a korril reef, and rubbed a tarnal big hole in her plankiu'. 

" That's a good yarn," said the parsing, " and I b'leive its true as gospel. INothin's impossible 
in natur' arrd the hull o' these strannge fixens as we hears tell on, is nothin' more than links in the 
almighty great chain cable of universal rratur'. Bats is the link of hetweenity that connects the 
naturs of fowls of the air and the beasts of the field. Seals and alligators links the naturs of beasts 
and fishes. Babboons and apes links beasts with humans; and why should not marmaids be the 
links between humans and the fishes of the sea 1 But there's the signal for the boat's return ; here's 
jest a leetle horn apiece in the bottle — let's licker once more round, and then absquattle." 

We pulled quietly back to the ship. The barrel of brandy had not been found, and I wish I may 
be sniggered if the capting did not fly into the biggest kind of quarter-deck passion I ever did see. 
He stormed great guns, and fired hull broadsides at the boat's crews, swearin' that they should keep 
on dredgin' till the tub was found, if it was the day arter etarnity. So, you see, the hands was 
piped to dinner, but I weie ordered tew keep in the boats and take keare they did'nt stave each 
other. Waell, I laid down in the capting's gig, and what with the parsing's licker, and the talk 
abeout marmaids and syringes and water gals, and one thing and t'other, a very pretty muss began- 
mixen' in my brain pan. So, as I was layin' corafortabl)'^ moored in the starn sheets, with my head 
a leetle over the boat's quarter, I thought it highly unwrong that the brandy tub hadn't been fetched 
up, and that the men usin' the grapnels must have shirked as we did, cos, if they'd sarched as they 
oughter they must have seed the barrel, for the water vvas so petikler clear that you could dissarn the 
crabs crawlin' over the korril rocks at the bottom o' twenty fathom water. Waell, while I was 
lookin' into the ocean to see if I could light upon the barrel, a leetle of the largest fish I ever did 
see, come and swum right close to the bottom of the sea, jest under the boats. Then it kept risin' 
and risin' till I seed its long fins were shaped like men's arms ; and when it come near the sarfis, it: 



BURTON'S GENTLEMAN S MAGAZINE 

turned on its back and then I seed a human face ! I knowed at once that it was a niarmaid, or a 
marman — or one of them amfibberus critters called flibbelus syringes as the chapUng had been 
spinnin' his j'arns abeout. So, the critter popt its head up jest above the water, which was smooth 
as glass, and a leetle smoother tew by a darned sight, and jest as clear and jest as shiny, and says 
he to me, " Look here, strannger, you and your shipmates aint doin' the genteel thing to me no how 
jou can fix it, for they're playin' old hub with my garding grounds and oyster beds by scratchin' and 
lakin' 'em all over with them thar' darned anchors and grapnel fixens in a manner that's harrowin' 
to my feeiin's. If the capting wants his thundernation licker tub, let him jest send eeny decent 
Christian down with me, and I'll gin it him." 

Waell, I'm not goin' to say that I did'nt feel kinder sheered, hut the chapling's yarns had mbbed 
the rough edge off, and the notion of findin' the capting's cask pleased me mightily, cos I knowed 
it would tickle the old man like all creation, and sartingly get me three or four liberty-days for shore- 
goin' when we returned to Port Mahon. So, as I had'nt on nothin' petikler as would spile, only 
a blue cotting shirt and sail-cloth pantys, and the weather being most uncommon warm, I jest told 
the marman I was ready, and tortled quietly over the boat's side into the blue transparent sea. The 
marman grappled me by the fist, and we soon touched bottom, now I tell ye. I found as I could 
walk easy enough, only the water swayed me abeout jest as if I war a leetle tight, but I did'nt seem 
to suffer nothin' for want of breath nyther. We soon reached whar' the brandy cask was lying 
right under the ship's keel, which accounts for its not bein' seen nor nothin' by the boat's crews. I 
felt so everlastingly comical abeout findin' the tub that I told the half-bred-dolphing feller as pinted 
it out, that if I knowed how to tap it, I wish I might die if I would'nt give him a gallon o' the stuff 
as a salvacre fee. 

•' What's in itl" says the marman. 

" Why, licker," says I. 

" Waell," says the marman, " so I heerd them scrapin' fellers in the boats say ; but I guess I've 
licker enough to last my time, tho' I recking your licker is somethin' stronger than salt water, seein' 
its hooped up in that almighty way." 

" Why, you lubber," says I, " its brandy — the raal ginnewine concyhack." 

" And what's that V says the marman. 

" Why, dew tell — want to knovi' 1" says I, " Have you lived to your time o' lif.3 without tastin' 
spirretus lickei ? Waell, I swow, you oughter be the commodore of all them cold water clubs, and 
perpetual president of all temp'rance teetotallers. Go ahead, matey ; pilot the way to your shanty, 
and I'll roll the barrel arter you. I'll sune gin you a diink of licker that will jest take the shirt 
tail off eeny thing j^ou ever did taste, now I tell you." 

Waell, the critter flopped ahead, for you see its the natur' of the marmen, seein' as they've no 
legs, only a fish's tail what's bent under them jest like the lower part o' the letter J, to make way 
by floppin' their starns up and down, and paddlin' with their hands — somethin' between a sv/im and 
a swagger — but the way they get through the water is a caution. I rolled the tub along over the 
smooth white shiny sand, and the crabs and lobsters sheeted off right and left sides out o' my way, 
reglar sheered, and big fishes of all shapes and makes, vi'ith bristlin' fins, swum close alongside me, 
and looked at me quite awful with their small gooseberry eyes, as much as to say " what the nation 
are you all" Byrne by, the marman brought up in front of rayther a largish cave or grotto of rock 
and shell work, kivered with kon il and sea weed. So, you see, the tub was put right oir eend in one 
comer; I made an ennquirry of the marman if he'd a gimblet, and he said he b'lieved there was 
sitch a thing in the hold or cellar ; he'd found a carpenter's tool chest in a wreck a few miles to the 
easterd, and he fetched away six or seving of the leetle fixins, thinkin' they might be useful to hum — 
so, he opened the back door and hailed a young marman to bring him the gimblet. 

Seein' as there was no benches nor nothin' to sit down on, which marmen and marmaids don't 
desire, cos thej^'ve no sittin' parts to their bodies, which is all fish from their waistbands, I jest sot 
on the top o' the brandy tub, and took an observashing of the critter before me. His face was reglar 
human, only it looked rayther tawney and flabby like a biled nigger, with fishy eyes, and a mouth 
like a huge torn cod. His hair hung stret down his shoulders, and was coarse and thick like un- 
twisted rattlin' ; his hands were somethin' like a goose's paw, only the fingers was longer and 
thicker — and his body was not exackly like an Injin's, nor a nigger's, nor a white man's — nor was 
it yaller, nor blue, nor green — but a sorter altogether kinder mixed up color, lookin' as if it were 
warranted to stand the weather. Jest about midships, his body was tucked into a fish's belly, with 
huge green scales right down to the tail. 

Whilst I weie survey in' the marman fore and aft, the back door opened, and a she critter flopped 
in. with a young marman at the breast. The leetle sucker was not bigger than a pickerel, with a 
tail of a delicate sammon color, and a head and body jest like one' o' them small tan monkeys, with 
a face as large as a dollar. The marman introduced the she critter as his wife, and we soon got into 
a coil of talk right slick all abeout the weather, and the keare and trouble of a young family — and 
I wish I may be swamped if the marmaid warn't a dreadful nice critter to chatter. Like all wim- 
ming folk, she was plaguey kewrous as to whar' I was raised and rigged — and when I said I guess- 
ed I hailed from Cape Cod and all along shore thar', she looked at the marman, and said to me, 



A CAPE CODDER, AMONG THE MERMAIDS. 291 

" Wacll, I never — Cape CoJ ! why, stianngcr, I guess there must be some 'finnity in our 
breeds." 

Waell, you see, I grew ray ther kewrous tew, and wanted to log the petiklers of the natural history 
of the race of marmen — so I made a few ennquerries respectin' their ways of life. " I guess," says 
I, "you've a tarnal good fish market in these here parts, and keep youi table well supplied with hol- 
libut, and sea bass, and black fish, eh 1" 

" Why, strannger," says the niarman raythcr wrathy, " seein' its you, I won't be offended, or by 
hewing, if that speech aint enough to make a quaker burn his stockin', why then it aint no matter. 
We claim to be half fish in our natui', and I recking you don't kalkilate we gobbles our relashings? 
there's sea varmint enough in all conscience, sitch as oysters, and clams, and quahogs, and muscles, 
and crabs, and lobsters. We go the hull shoat with them ; and then we cultivates kail and other 
sea truck in our gardings, and sometimes we swims under the wild fov/1 as the3''te floatin' and jerks 
down a fine duck or a gull, or gathers their eggs off the rocks, or the barnacles off drift wood." 

Jest then, the raarman's eldest son-fish fetched in the gimblet, and brought up the marman's 
jawin'-tacks with a round turn. The young 'un was abeout the size of an Injin boy jest afore he 
runs alone — half papoose, half porpus. He got a leetle skeered when he ciapt eyes on me, but I 
guv' him a stale quid o' backer to amuse himself, and the sugar plum made the marmaster roll his 
eyes above a bit, now T tell you. 

Waell, I bored a hole in the brandy tub, and pickin' up an empty clam shell, handed a drink to 
the lady, and told her to tote it down. She swallered it pretty slick, and the way she gulped arter- 
wards, and stared, and twisted her fishy mouth was a sin to Moses. The marman looked rather 
wolfy at me as if I'd gin her pison ; so I drawed a shell-full and swallered it myself. This kinder 
cooled him down, and when the marmaid got her tongue tackle in runnin' order agin, she said she 
guessed the hcker was the juice of hewing, and she'd be darned if she wouldn't have another drink 
right off the reel. 

Seein' this, the marman swallered his dose, and no sooner got it down than he squealed right out, 
and clapped his webby hands together, and waggled his tail like all creation. He swore it was olcgant 
stuff, and he felt it tickle powerful from the top of his head to the eend of his starn fin. Arter takin' 
two or three horns together, the sonny cried for a drink, and I gin him one that sent him wrigglin' 
on the sand like an eel in an uneasiness. So, the marman said as the licker was raal first-rate, and 
first-rater than that tew, he guessed he'd ask in his next door neighbor and his lady, jest to taste the 
godsend. Waell, in a minnit, in comes a huge marman of" the most almighty size, lookin' jest like 
Black Hawk when he was bilious ; he fetched up his lady with him, and his eldest son, a scraggy 
hobadeho}^ marman, and his darters, two young marmaids or raarmisses, jest goin' out o' their teens, 
who flapped their yaller-skinned paws over their punking-colored chops, pretendin' to be almighty 
skeered at comin' afore a strannge man in a state o' natur' — but they forgot all abeout that thar' 
when the licker was handed to 'em. 

Arter takin' a few sraallers, the fresh marman said he guessed the clam shell was altogether too 
leetle to get a proper amount of licker vi'hereby a feller could judge correctly of the raal taste of the 
stuff — so he went to his berth in the next cave, and fotched a large blue and silver shell that held 
abeout a pint. The news o' the brandy tub spred pretty slick, for in half an hour, I'd the hull grist 
o' the marmen belongin' to that settlement cooped up in the cavern. Sitch a noisy swillin' set o' 
wet souls I never did see ; the drunk cum on 'em almighty strong, for they kept me sarvin' out the 
licker jest as quick as it would run. I thought if the capting could have seen me astridin' his brandy 
cask, in an underground grocery at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by sich a skeul of odd fish, 
how many dozen at the gangway would he have ordered the boson's mate to have sarved me out 1 
The way the diunk affected the difl'erent critters was right kewrous, now I tell you. One great 
scaly feller stiffened his tail all up, and stood poppindickler erect oir the peeked pints of the eend fin, 
like a jury mast, and jawed away raal dignified at all the rest, wantin' them to appint him a sorter 
admiral over the hull crew. Another yeller feller with a green tail, was so dreadful blue, that he 
doubled himself into a figgery 5, and sung scraps and bits of all sorts of sea songs, till he got tew 
drunk to speak at all. Some of the marmen wanted to kiss all the marmaids, and tew of the ladies 
begun scratchin' and fightin' like two pusseys, cos one trod on t'other's tail. Some went floppin' 
and dancin' on the sand like mad, raisin' sitch a dust that I could not see to draw the licker — but the 
party round the tub soon driv' them to the right abeout, as interferin' with the interest of the settle- 
ment. Every minnit some fresh marman dropped on the ground with the biggest kind of load on ; 
I never seed a set of critters so almighty tight, yellin', svvearin', huggin', and fightin', till they growed 
so darned savagerous that I kinder feared for my own safety amongst them drunking moffradite sea 
aborgoines. So, you see, I up and told them that I'd clapt my veto on the licker, and that they 
should not have any more. Waell, if ever you did hear a most etariral row, or see a hull raft of 
drunking fellers cut didoes, then was the time. It was voted that I were a public enemy, and every 
half drunking marman suddenly became very 'fishus to have me Lynched, and it were settled at last 
that I was to be rode on a rail, and then tarred and feathered. But while some of the varmint went 
arter the rail and the tar. the rest of the critters begun quarrelin' who was to sarve out the licker ; 
and as each marman, drunk or sober, wanted to have the keare of the precious stuff, they soon raised

a pretty muss, and kept on tearin' at each other hke a pack of wolves. Seein' this, I jest kinder 
sneaked quietly away from the cave grocery till I come in sight of the ship, when I struck upperds 
for the sarfis, and swum for dear life. I soon seed that the boat's crews were musterin' for another 
bout of draggin' for the brandy cask, so fearin' lest the capting should miss me, I jest laid hold o' 
the edge of the gig, and crawled in pretty quickly, and laid myself down in the starn sheets, as if I'd 
never been out o' the boat. Waell, I hadn't laid ihar' half a second when I heerd a noise jest for all 
the world as if somebody was squeezin' a small thunder cloud right over my head. I ruz up, and 
thar' were the capting and the hull crew lookin' over the ship's side at me — the officers in a tarnal 
rage, and the men grinnin' like so many hyenas. 

" Eouse up, you longsided lazy svi^ab, and bring the boats in from the boom. Are you going to 
sleep all day '!" 

" Ay, ay, sir," said I, jumpin' up in the boat, when all the water lun off me like forty thousand 
mill streams — I'd been so outrageous soaked while down with the marmen. I felt kinder skeered 
lest the capting should see it, but when I stood up he laifed right out, and so did the hull crew tew. 

" Why, he's not awake yet," said the capting. " Bosen, give him another bucket." 

You see they wanted to persuade me that I'd feel asleep in the gig as fast as a meetin' house, and 
slept thar' the hull while the crew were at dinner, and that no shoutin' nor nothin' could'nt waken 
me up — so, the bosen run along the boom and jest gin me a couple o' buckets o' sea water right 
over me. When I told 'em my yarn abeout the marman poppin' up his head, and invitin' me down, 
and all abeout findin' the brandy tub, and the rest, they swore that I'd got drunk on the parsing's 
licker, and dreamt it all in the boat. But I guess I know what I did see, jest abeout as slick as any 
body ; and the chapling b'lieved the hull story ; and said that as I'd larnt the marmen the vally o' 
licker, they'd get huntin' up all the tubs and barrels out of the different wrecks in all the various 
seas ; and that intemperance would spile the race, and thin 'em off till they became one the things 
that was — ^jest like the Injins what's wastin' away by the power o' rum and whiskey gin them by the 
white men. 

I recking the parsing war'nt far out in his kalkilayshing. The love o' licker has had its effect 
upon the marmen and the marmaids ; they must have thinned off surprisingly, for I aint seed none 
since, nor I don't know nobody as has, nyther. 



STANZAS 



liADT " thy vows were traced in sand," 
With pencil light, and careless hand, 
And every idle wind that blew. 
Declared the feeble lines untrue ; 
Trembling I saw thy plighted faith. 
The sport of every vagrant breath — 
Yet lingered still, like one who stands, 
To view the flight of golden sands. 

Thy heart was like the sweetest flower, 
That blossoms in a lady's bower ; — 
And like the bird of golden wing. 
That sips the honied dew of spring. 
Like fancy loved to hover near. 
The nectar'd leaf that glittered there ; 
Deceptive leaf ! so bright to view. 
So sweet to taste ! so trifling too ! 

Lady resume thy pencil now. 
And write thy cruel vows in snow ; 
For that is cold as maiden's heart. 
And fiail as sand, will soon depart ; 



nd glist' ning as the maiden's tear, 
When Hymen's burning torch is near, 
But when 'tis brightest, feeblest, proves 
Decaying by the warmth it loves ! 

But while along the faithless line, 
New loves, and hopes, and raptures shine, 
To 'guile some raw enamored youth, 
That recks not of a woman's truth — 
Forget thy promise pledged to me — 
Forget thy heart's inconstancy — 
Nor let a darken'd hour like this 
Intrude to blight thy transient bliss. 

For should'st thy truant fancy rove 
Back to the vernal days of love. 
When new-boin hope thy bosom thrill'd, 
And vows were sworn, by kisses seal'd. 
The blush of shame would brightly glow, 
Along the chilly page of snow. 
And melting tablets far and wide, 
Display thy faithless maiden pride !

THE PRIVATEER 



A TALE OF THE LATE AMERICAN WAR, 



[Concluded from page 219] 



CHAPTER IX. 

THE MINSTREL AND THE END. 

Still weep'stthou, wanderer? some fond mother's glance 

O'er tliee, too, brooded in thine eai-ly years — 
Think'st thou of her whose gentle eye, perchance. 

Bathed all thy faded hair with parting tears ? 
Sptak, for thy tears disturb me— what art thou ? 

Why dost thou hide tliy face, yet weejiing on ? 
Look up ! - oh ! is it— that wan cheek and brow ! — 

Is it— alas ! — yet joy ! my son, my sou ! 

He.nans. 

The orphan's prayer was heaid, and she was not marked for a cheerless pilgrimage through the 
singing vale of life. A love, like that of sisteis met in heaven, sprung up between Catharine and 
Agnes. It was a sight of rare and tender interest to see that beautiful pair together — a graceful task 
for the most gifted pencil. Each was an exquisite specimen of the two fairest orders of female love- 
liness. Agnes was the girl — playful, timid, gentle, and earnest; and Cathaiine, the matured and 
magnificent woman; the one, a sylph, living on the air of roses — the other, an angel, with a lyre. 

Yet how imperfect is human joy ! The mute devotion of her brother and his gentle wife to each 
other, partaking so much of the romance of passion, their sweet and holy confidence, and the elo- 
quent worship of their eyes, as they read, with a thrill, each other's meaning, would often start the 
tinconscious sigh, the brimming tear; and Catharine thought, with a pang, how much and how lit- 
tle of happiness was hers. 

" Tell us again of your fortunes at sea," said Catharine to her brother one day, as, with an arm 
of Agnes around hei neck, and their cheeks softly touching, they reclined on an ottoman. " I al- 
most envy the ocean its interest, since it could win you from your home and me." 

"I have told you all, dear sister, except" — and Charles hesitated. 

"Except, brother"!" 

" Do you know thisl" he inquired hurriedly, drawing a braid from his bosom. 

Catharine paled as she took it ; she compared it with her curls, and looked beseechingly at her 
brother. 

" Walter sent it to you, with his last blessing." 

" It is mine," shrieked the agonized lady, " and my poor cousin is dead — dead !" 

Her low and melancholy sobs were exquisitely touching ; the weeping Agnes shielded her on her 
tosom, and Harman, agitated almost beyond words, took his sister's passive hand. 

"No, no — not dead, my own dear sister; listen, and I will tell you all. I was a captive at sea, 
in a British vessel — one teirible night, in the fury of an appalling storm, we were startled by the 
bursts of cannon and the shout of battle. Shortly came the rattle of musquetry, and the furious 
trampling of fighting men ; but louder than all was the wai-ciy of my country's name. For more 
than an hour, the angry battle raged, till theie burst a deafening hurrah of victory, and all was silent. 
We were free, and Walter De Berrian was among the conquerors." 

" Then he is alive ! Oh, where is he ]" 

" We parted in a foreign port, two years ago. I would have sacrificed my commission to induce 
him to return ; but he shook his head, and told me the Sea-Gull was his home." 

"The Sea-Gull ! — then he is gone for ever !" slowly lepeated (ilatharine, in the hollow tones of 
despair, while the fast and burning tears were streaming over her cheeks. She remembered to have 
read a mysterious account of the Sea-Gull's last fight. 



294 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" And he never spoke unkindly of meV inquired the heart-stricken lady, with a strong attempt 
at composure. 

She listened with intense distress while Harman related their parting interview, and De Berrian's 
last, touching message. 

" Tiien he always loved me — wronged and devoted Walter ! That sad, last prayer has gone up, 
and he knows how bitterly I repent and love him ! My kind brother, and you, sweet Agnes, dearer 
far than a sister, cheer me no more with false hopes — seek not to win me from my lone communion 
with the memory of tlie dead. I am calm now, and for ever !" 

And there was something so melancholy, yet beseeching, in the calmness that henceforth settled 
over her lonely hours, that its spell was sacred. 

Months crept on, and the world, slurabeiing from the fatigue of its mightiest struggle, was shaken 
from its momentary rest by the stirring blast of war. The thunders of Waterloo pealed from pole 
to pole, and died away in the echo of the sea. The world was again at peace, and what kept the 
wanderer away 1 There was now no strife to gather those of burdened and joyless life, yet still he 
came not. Harman, at length, despaired; and the name of Walter De Berrian was heard only in 
whispers in the home of his childhood. 

And autumn came — the queenly Cleopatra of the seasons dying in her robe and crown. It was 
the time of pensive rambles and lonely thought, when a story is written on every leaf, and a warn- 
ing tongue whispers in every breeze. It was one of those sad and poetic evenings in the Indian 
summer that Harman and his bride had driven out, when Catharine took a stioU to the grove on the 
slope of the bay. She sat on the rustic bench so sacred to melancholy thought; for Walter assisted 
to build it. It was shaded by a bower of vines, and sheltered from storm and sun by an ample oak, 
above, while the cool, smooth beach swept at its foot, so that the waves of the high tide sometimes 
washed the ripe blue grapes that clustered on the lowest bough. The bay was beautifully tranquil, 
and the handsome oak that spread above saw itself in the tide, and dropped a gentle leaf to woo its 
shadow. The frail messenger drifted to Catharine's feet, and was stranded on the sand. "Emblem 
of my hopes," thought the lady, stooping to pick it up, while her long hair fell from her shoulders 
and hung over her cheeks in raven volumes, giving to her face the softest light of eve. Catharine 
might have well been pardoned for that long and involuntary gaze, as she caught her image in the 
water. A flash of womanly pride was beaming in her eye, and the soul-entrancing triumphs of that 
matchless beauty were sweeping in brilliant array before her. She was again whirling through the 
dance on her birth-night ball, the unquestioned queen of the fair ; and then came tiiat solitary mid- 
night reverie, when the revellers were hushed in sleep. 

" Yes, I deserve to be unhappy," she said ; and, twining a hand in her mourning tresses, she gazed 
en the tinted sky as some exiled angel awaiting a summons to her home. 

But who was that half minstrel, half beggar-looking itinerant, that watched her with the eyes of 
a lynx? Dressed in a foreign vagrant costume, a dusty, sun-burnt mendicant, with heavy mousta- 
ches, long brownish curls, and an old guitar, stood, half-hid by the nearest tree, gazing with a wild 
and half-affrighted air at the unconscious Catharine. He stole nearer, and Altered. He advanced 
again — his foot was on the sand — and he raised an unsteady hand to the strings of the guitar — his 
arm was stilled as by the wand of an unseen spirit ; for Catharine had begun to warble a half-for- 
gotten air of her girlhood. It was a song of dreaming, melancholy meaning, and she had often sung 
it in Walter's presence, for the mute flattery of his looks. Her voice, so low at first and exquisitely 
sweet, seemed to float and melt in mystery, as if to puzzle the hstener to find its origin. Concealed 
as the songstress was by boughs and vines, one might have fancied it the lament of some lone-heart- 
ed mermaid, who had stolen from the dark blue sea to die. The song rose by soft degrees, like the 
tide's murmur in sea-shells, till it swelled to the richest volume of melody. The minstrel stood for 
a moment in the attitude of a spell-bound listener. As if suddenly recollecting himself, he lightly 
stepped to his tree, brushed a mass of dusty curls over his features, diew down his slouched hat, and 
listened eagerly again. Never had Catharine sung so divmely, even in the wildest rapture of deli- 
cious coquetry. Now, all the poetry of early and blighted love, of youth robbed of its sunny charm, 
and memory hallowed by joys that were, seemed breathing in her tones of passion; and when the 
last clear note slept in the pathos of sound, the songstress bowed her noble head and wept. 

She started, as some holy spirit wakened from the shrine of its worship ! At first, low and un- 
steady, she caught the tinkling of a rich-toned guitar, and then the trembling concord of a mellow 
voice. Mute, breathless, and amazed, she drank the bolder harmony of a lament as sad and touch- 
ing as her own. It spoke of young love scorned by a proud and cruel one ; then, bursting haugh- 
tily to a loftier strain, it sung of the battling sea, and the conqueror's shout. Sinking to a wail 
again, it mourned a dark imprisonment, misery, a desolate home, and forgotten friends. There was 
something in the last melancholy stanza that spoke the beautiful faith of a breaking heart ! 

Yet if amid a desert land, 

My sinking limbs I lie, 
Her name I'll trace upon the sand, 

And kiss it as I die. 



THE PRIVATEER. 295 

The poor minstrel had ceased, and he seemed lost in a lamble of thought. Catharine stood at 
his side without knowing how she came there. 

" Look uj)," she hoarsely whispered. 

The startk^d minstrel was on his feet, and turned an unknown countenance to the lady. Poor 
Catharine — it was not Ids face ! 

" Lady !" said the minstrel, beseechingly, (and alas ! his voice, too, was strange,) "lady, I have 
travelled far to-day, and rested in this lovely spot for one short hour. I would have gone, but your 
song, lady, was music to the heart of a homeless wanderer." 

" Your dress — whence came you ?" 

"From over the ocean, lady." 

"Then, oh, perhaps you have seen him — Walter V 

Catharine stopped, and shuddered at her unmaidenly betrayal. A slight tremor shook the min- 
strel's frame. 

" Your pardon, lady," he said, " I could weep that one so young and lovely should know sorrow. 
Youi tears — pardon again, kindest lady — those tears, though not for me, betray a gentle heart, and 
you will not turn away from the stoiy of wo. Listen, lady ; for once I had a name and home per- 
chance as fair as thine ; but, in a day, I was friendless, homeless, and unknown. This is my coun- 
try, and hither I have come to day. For a tedious time, I was a prisonei in a foieign cell ; but peace 
came at last, and I breathed the free air of heaven. One of thy gentle sex taught me this guitar on 
the banks of the Xenil, and with home before my eyes, I took up a lonely wandering. At the gates 
of Grenoble, I first saw the great Napoleon. Catching the mad enthusiasm which that wonderful 
man could inspire in a smile, I was marching under the imperial eagle. Lady, I was at Waterloo, 
The sable curtain fell, and I was again a homeless itinerant for bread. I stand upon my country's 
shore, a stranger in my home. My name is graven on the tomb, and my blood is cold beneath." 

" Come, sir, vi'ith me," said Catharine, in the warmth of her feelings, " and accept a stranger's 
assistance ; you shall go away with a smile." 

" Take the fervent thanks of a grateful heart," said the minstrel, with an eloquent look. " Lady 
you, too, shall smile again !" 

Catharine had no time to question the meaning of those last words, for a distant shriek and the 
increasing rattle of carriage wheels came faintly from a grassy woodland road that swept in winding 
caprice through the grove, not far from the shore. Springing wildly up the slight bank, followed 
closely by the minstrel, Catharine shuddered to see the carriage of her brother whirling furiously to- 
wards them. Suddenly, it dashed from the road, as if coming directly to the spot where they stood, 
the frightened horses plunging aside at every turn, evidently beyond the control of the driver, and 
the invisible wheels grazed and scattered the bark from the trees. 

" Oh, can no earthly power save theml" screamed Catharine, as she turned to the minstrel. He 
was pale, erect, and not a muscle moved. 

" Who are they, dear Catharine — that is — sweet lady 1" 

" My name I Walter 1 Save them — my brother — my sister !" 

The minstrel was gone. With a bound he gained the shelter of an oak, and at the next instant 
he had grasped the reins. The fierce animals flung him from his feet, as they reared and leaped 
frantically forward. With the grasp of a Hercules, the minstrel held on, but they reared again, and 
leaped within a few feet of the swooning, helpless Cathaiine. Snorting with wildest terror, the 
horses plunged convulsively again — the next instant Catharine would have been crushed, when she 
was snatched from the ground in the arms of a sailor-looking negro, and borne to a place of safety. 
The negro bounded to the minstrel's aid, and by their united force, the foam-coveied horses stood 
trembling under their hands. 

" Hah ! hah ! dey know you now, Mas Walter," chuckled the negro, Peter ; " hat gone, and de 
hair hab drapt off your face !" 

The driver had flung open the door of the carriage, and Harman, with Agnes in his arms, jump- 
ed upon the ground. At the first glance of the minstrel, Harmnn exclaimed " Walter Do Berrian I" 
and rushed into his arms. De Berrian tore himself away, and knelt at Catharine's side. 

" Wake, dearest cousin !" and he folded her to his breast. 

" Are they safe V she languidly asked. 

" Yes, my adored Catharine !" 

" And you are" — 

" Walter De Berrian !" 

" My Walter !" murmured Catharine, with a blissful confusion, as she hid hei lovely face upon 
his throbbing bosom. 

" Yar ! y ar !" laughed Peter, almost crying with delight, as he surveyed the happy group ; «' God 
hress 'em — bress 'em all !" And, reader, with equal good will, do I also say — '• God bless ihee !"

ELDER, COLUMBIA, PA, 



Twilight slept upon Eden. The bright flowers | 
That had all day their richest odors flung 
Out on the gentle breeze, were closing up, 
Like some great mind that for a time hugs close 
Its glorious thoughts, until their painful weight 
Compels the miser to unlock his store 
And yield its treasures. Here and there a star 
Stood out upon the lirmament. The breeze, 
Which stirs on summer nights so mournfully, 
iBore on its wings the dull and solemn bleat 
Prom distant folds ; and the quick silvery sound 
Of a bright rivulet, that circled by, 
Rippling along, came full upon the ear, 
Sweet and monotonous. 

It was a beauteous scene — 
And aught but conscious guiltiness had hung 
Upon that spread of glory, with a heart 
Warm with devotion ; but not so was Cain's — 
Gloomy and sad, he trod his lonely fields. 
And his heart sicken'd, and his spirit sunk. 
As his eye rested on it ; and his thought 
Went back to other days, and memory sketclrd 
The faithful likeness of his childhood's hours. 
" Long ago," thus mused the gui!t-worn fratricide, 
" In those bright bowers of Eden have I strayed, 
And, with my little brotlier by my side. 
Chased the gay-liveried butterflies about 
From flower to flower ; and how my heart would 

beat 
To see him bound along in frolic mood. 
And mock the blithesome carol of the birds 
As they poured forth their noontide chant ! and 

then, 
.When play had tired his young and feeble limbs. 
On beds of loses, shelter'd from the sun 
By the rich foliage of some fragrant shiub 
•Or willow-jasmine, have we laid us down, 
Lock'd in a close, fraternal, warm embrace, 
Till sleep restored the vigor of our frames. 
When the day's toil was o'er, and evening came, 
And the bright stars were scatter'd over heaven — 
How often have we sat, I on the knee 
Of my kind father, and my brother press'd 
Close to his mother's bosom, and there heard 
Our parents tell of all the happy days 
Before their dreadful fall — before that sin 
Which tore them from the confidence of God, 
And seal'd misfortune on the human race. 
The tale was oft rehearsed, but Abel still. 
With childish waywardness, would crave it more, 
A.nd then our father, with a gentle smile. 
Would tell it o'er. Oh, happy hours, long past, 
Why does stern memory call ye up again ! 
Why is my tortur'd brain wrung with the scenes 



Which erst gave happiness ! My brother's blood 
CUngs to my guilty hands, and the dread thought— 
The thought of murder— oh ! the cursed deed — 
Like a barbed arrow rankles at my heart !" 
Thus mused the guilty one. His past delights, 
His dear remembrances of Eden's joys, 
Sprung up like venom'd things within his soul, 
And sicken'd every thought. Before him lay 
Scenes that the eye might feast on — that would 

once 
Have roused his every feeling into play 
And nerved his soul to energy ; but now, 
His only thought was Abel ; and those scenes, 
Breathing of happier days, but sent the shaft 
Deeper and deeper to the conscience-seat ! 
He gazed in passive listlessness upon 
The imager}^ of henven. until a voice 
That in times past had pleased him well to hear, 
Startled the dreamer. At the voice of God 
The murd'rcr trembled, and his spirit quailed 
Back to its deepest black recess. But guilt 
Wears oftentimes the bright habiliments 
Which robe the form of innocence ; and Cain, 
The guilty Cain, upraised his voice to speak, 
And to the stern demand, "where is thy brother!" 
Essay 'd prevarication ! But the voice 
Of Him who bade this glorious world to BE — 
Who spread the precious jewelry of heaven, 
Whose wisdom and whose knowledge brook no 

bound. 
Spoke forth again : "What hast thou done 1 the 

voice 
Of innocent blood, spilt by thy treacherous hand, 
Thy brothel's blood, cries to mc from the ground! 
And, now, thou spoiler of the work of God; 
Thou worm, whotrod'st another worm to dust — 
iS'ow thou art cursed from this beauteous earth. 
With all its pageantry of glorious things, 
Which opens wide its mouth to drink the stream, 
The purple current of thy brother's blood ! 
No more the earth (which erst in plenteous store 
Would yield her fruits) thy labor shall repay. 
The world will scorn thee. Epithets of hate 
Will follovir in thy footsteps : thou wilt be 
Spurn'd by thy fellows as a loathed thing — 
A fugitive and vagabond !" But Cain, 
Smarting with conscious guilt and deep remorse ; 
Humbled in spirit by that bitter curse, 
Spoke to the Lord in terms of gentle plaint; 
And the kind Father of the human race 
Mark'd him, lest men should slay him — and the 

first 
That dipp'd his hands in human gore, went out 
From the dread presence of the Lord !

TRANSLATED FROM THE TALES OF KRASICKL 



BT THOMAS DIKN ENGLISH, M. D, 



r. juzup. 



Isr the commercial town of Bassora there lived a citizen called Juzup, He was of mean extract- 
ion, but understanding something of commercial affairs, he was enabled to supply the wants of life 
and bestow on his children an education suitable to their condition. In short, by his industry he 
attained the middle station of life, the one which is freest from temptation, and therefore the hap- 
piest. His uncle, Rachib, was a merchant, industrious in his profession. Being industrious, fortune 
favored him ; and as he decUned in years, he became possessed of a consideiable amount of proper- 
ty. Feehng himself growing feebler daily, he made his will, to which he attached the following co- 
dicil : " I leave this world childless. Though my nephew Juzup will inherit all my property it is 
against my wish that it should ever be divided. I therefore command him to bestow it all, at his: 
death, on that one of his sons whom he shall deem worthy to be its master." 

It was known to Juzup that he would inherit the estate, but of the existence of the codicil, which 
forbade a division of the inheritance, he was, for a time, ignorant. At length Rachib, feehno- him- 
self near an end, sent for his nephew. When he had come unto him, he spake as follows ^ « My 
dear nephew, since Allah did not bless me with any children, with entire satisfaction do I look 
upon thee as my heir, for thy virtues and thy prudence have forced me to admire thee. Thou 
knowest that, in my will, I have made thee the inheritor of ray wealth, and I feel confident that thou 
wilt use it well. Now I will tell thee that which I have nevei told thee before. I cannot bear the 
thought of having my property so soon divided. Thou hast three sons, and if it were equally di- 
vided among them, it would make them tolerably independent, and no more. Now, it is my wish 
that, when I die, one only shall live abundantly from the fruits of my toil." He then showed the 
codicil to Juzup, which ran as we have before shown. Then, having sworn him to secrecy Rachih 
expired. ^ ' 

After the death of his uncle, Juzup became immensely rich, and using his wealth with economy 
and prudence, he added thereto ; endeavoring at the same time to discover who was most worthy 
of the inheritance. Mustapha, the eldest of the three sons, departed, and became a courtier in the 
palace of the Pacha of Aleppo. The next, Abul, went to the schools, and studied law making in 
a short time such progress, that the teachers weie of opinion he would soon equal, and perhaps 
excel them. Achmet, the youngest, remained at home in the store of his father, and assisted 
him m his busmess. The difficulty of bestowing the estate on the most deserving harrassed 
the mmd of Juzup. But sickness came upon him, and when, after the care of the most skilful 
physicians, he felt his end approaching, he called all his sons to his side. When there assembled 
he spoke to them thus : " Already, my dear children, the spirit of death knocks at my door and the 
decree of nature and of Allah orders me to leave you. I know your attachment to me to be great— 
now, tell me how you will show it when I am no more." 

"I," said Mustapha, the eldest, " adoring your virtues, will build you a tomb such as Bassora 
hath never yet seen." 

"I," said Abul, "will search for the most learned writers, that, in prose and verse thev mav 
praise thy virtues," ' ^ ^ 

It now became the turn of the youngest to speak, but he was, from excess of emotion, unable and 
stood mute, until, at length, a flood of tears gave him relief. The father bade them all to go out 
from him, and calling the cadi, on the next morning indited a will. On the next morning he 

After the funeral ceremonies were over, the will was opened and read. In it was written : « The

property obtained from my paients, and that which my own industiy added to it, is to be equally 
divided among my three sons. That which my uncle Rachib left at my disposal I resign to Ach- 
met, my youngest born, whose tears of love at the thoughts of my loss would not suffer him to 
speak his love for me." 



II. THE DEPOSIT. 

A merchant of Damascus,'about to visit a distant nation, requested a neighbor of his, in whom be 
had great confidence, to take charge of a hundred pounds of steel belonging to him, until his return. 
When the merchant departed, his neighbor, tempted by its value, appropriated it to his own use. 
After doing so, he thought carefully how he should conceal his dishonor. Meanwhile, the traveller 
returned, and asked for the steel. 

" I know not what to say," observed the neighbor, " and what I am about to tell thee I would not 
have believed, did I not witness it with inine own eyes. A rat, of immense size, entered my ware- 
house, and destroyed thy steel. I, seeing it become lesser and lesser every day, determined to watch 
it, and fulfilled my determination. I saw him myself as he was devouring the last of it." 

After such a vicious and shameless falsehood, the merchant easily saw the dishonesty of his neigh- 
bor. He, however, nfiected to believe the fable, and went home. In a few days after the occurrence, 
he saw several children playing in the streets, among the rest his neighbor's son. This latter he en- 
ticed into his house, and there concealed. The parent soon missed his child, and searched every 
where for him, in great distress. After spending the whole night in an useless inquiry, he came in 
the morning to the merchant, and relating the disaster, asked if he knew aught of the child. 

" Perhaps a hawk might have taken him," said the merchant, " for yesterday evening I saw one 
passing over the house with a child in his talons." 

" Thy jokes are unseasonable," replied the distressed parent ; " how could so small a bird lift so 
great a weight 1" 

" In a town, my dear neighbor," replied the other, " where a rat can consume one hundred poundsj 
of steel, why could not a hawk be found able to lift a child in the air 1" 

" I. have told thee an untruth," said the neighbor ; " come and take back thy steel." 

" I, also, spoke not the truth," said the merchant ; '• thy child is in my house." 



III. IBRAHIM AND OS MAN. 

There were two brothers in Cairo, one of whom was named Osman, and the other Ibrahim. 
They were both rich, and, as the}' managed their affairs with prudence, theii wealth became in- 
creased, till they were considered the richest men of the place. As they lived in amity, they came 
to see each other whenever their business did not prevent such visits. Once, when walking on the 
shores of the Nile, Ibrahim said to Osmaxiy " Brother, Allah has blest us with wealth, in what way 
have we shown our gratitude?" 

" I do my utmost," repHed Osman ; " I observe Rhamazan strictly, frequent the mosques, do not 
neglect the five ablutions, and, as thou knowest, have visited Mecca and Medina." 

" I did not visit either," said Ibrahim, " though I wished to do so. I was prepared for the pilgrim- 
age, when a circumstance prevented me from enjoying the greatest happiness a man can have on 
earth." 

" What was the circumsta,nce 1" inquired Osman. 

Silent was Ibrahim, and though his brother pressed him, would return no answer. 

Offended by this, Osman left the place, and his departure cast a gloom over the mind of his bro- 
tlier. While he was depressed by this, he seated himself in the shade of some palm trees, and sleep 
overcame him. Then he perceived a dignified and venerable man before him, who spoke thus : — 
" To visit the grave of the prophet is laudable — but thou didst better in not doing so, when thy un- 
cle Hassan was in a declining state. Thy brother forsook him that he might go to Mecca ; his pil- 
grimage was vain, and disregarded by Allah. Thy denial was worthier, and now is of ten-fold value 
since thy modesty forbade thee to tell the reason why thou wert not a pilgrim." 



IV. H AZ AD. 

Not far from the celebrated city of Damascus lived a venerable old man, named Hazad, tvhortfeiii- 
bled from age as the leaf in the wind. He had three sons, to each of whom he gave an educati on ap- 
propriate to his nature. When, bent down by years and infirBGuties, he called them to him, and 



EASTERN FABLES. 299 

thus spoke: " Azar, the spiiit of Heaven, seems to be a kind protector over us. Last night, he 
showed himself to me, and acquainted me that thou, Ibrahim, my first-born, wilt be a soldier ; thou, 
Osman, a lawyer, and thou, the child of my old age, Juzup, a merchant." 

" He furthermore predicted your future success in life, and gave me those three silver boxes you 
see before you." He then gave each of his sons a box, saying, " when thou, Ibrahim, who art to be 
a soldier, becomcst the leader of thy band, open thine. Thou, Osman, when thou becomest a judge, 
do likewise. And thou, Juzup, follow their example, when thou hast realized ten bags of gold. Ex- 
ert yourselves, therefore, my dear children, that you may be soon enabled to open your boxes." 
And so saying, he expired. 

After having, with great regret, buried their father, they recommended themselves to Azar, the 
heavenly spirit, and set diligently to work to fulfil their prescribed duties. After having for some 
time honestly labored, the eldest became a commander of his band, the second a judge, and the 
youngest in possession of ten purses of gold. They then met together. 

Ibrahim first opened his box, and found a paper bearing the following inscription : " End as thou 
hast begun, and thou mayst become a vizier." 

Osmati next opened his, and found therein the inscription ; " End as thou hast begun, and thou 
mayst become a mufti." 

Within his box, Juzup read : " End as thou hast begun, and thou mayst obtain a thousand bags 
of gold." ' 



V. ALEXANDER AND THE INDIAN PHILOSOPHER. 

After Aiex'&amp;rider had rna'stered Peir^a, He planned an expeidition foT the conquest of India. Hear- 
ing of 'tJhis ihtettded inviisioh, 'king fcobad sent, as an amhaissador, a well-known sage, in order, if 
possible, to appease or mollify his ardour. The philosopher had discovered many useful things, and 
being known, through faiiie, to Alexander, that monarch received him courteously. Being desi- 
rous, however, of testing the extent of his wisdom, the conqueror sent him a vessel of oil, so full, 
that a single drop vvould cause it to overflow. The sage laid a thousand needles on the oil, one by 
one, and sent the whole back to AlexarideV. 

When the vessel was brought back, the king brdered the whole to bs poured out, and from the 
needles found upon it, ordered the lilost perfectly round ball to be made, and sent to the sage. The 
latter, oh receiving it, ordered it to be stretched out, and made into a highly polished mirror, and in 
that state gave it into the hands of the messengers to be re-delivered to the monarch. Alexander sent 
back the mirror in a vessel filled with water ; and from it, the ambassador made a cup, which he filled 
with part of the water from the vessel, and despatched in return. The monarch returned the cup 
filled with earth. When the sage saw this, he wept, but returned no answer. On hearing of this, 
Alexander ordeted the philosopher before him, and asked him if he could explain the meaning of 
the symbols. 

"Oh ! grand mona.rch !" exclaimed the venerable Brahmin, " the vessel so well filled with oil 
signified thy knowledge gotten by education, and the experience thou imaginest thyself to possess ; 
the thousand needles, which laid upon it caused it not to stir, ought to have given thee to know, that 
though we imagine our knowledge to be boundless, much remains of which we have no concep- 
tion." 

'" The lieedles," said Alexandei'," of which I ordered a ball to be made, why didst thou change 
them to a mirroi 1" 

" The ball," answered the philosopher, " with its hardness and weight, signified a lofty mind, 
firrti, but of little lise. I changed it to a mirror, in which every one might behold himself; that it 
might aflord a lesson to thee, and induce thee to be useful to others as well as thyself." 

" I sent thee back the mirror in a vessel filled with water," said the monarch, " and why dids 
thou create of it a cup, fill it with water, and send it back 1" 

"The water, in which the mirror was immersed, signified the approach to eternity, in which we 
shall all be hidden. The cup which I filled with water enforced this truth, that the mind which we 
receive from nature, if we use it properly, will contain many great things. I wept on gazing at the 
earth with which thou filledst the cup, for I remember the fact, that both thou, with thy greatness, 
and all living, will yet lie within the embrace of the grave." 



SKETCHES FROM 



THE LOG OF OLD IRONSIDES 



BY THE AUTHOR OF "OLD IKONSIBUS OFF A LEE SHOKE. 



Your gloi-ious standard launch again, 
To meet another foe .' — Camp. 



ALONE IN THE LEVANT, 

Is 1821, Old Ironsides, having been repaired, left the harbor of New York, on a cruize. After 
"various voyages, she at length reached the scene of her early exploits in the Mediterranean; and on 
the first of October, 1827, we find her lying in the Gulf of Ismyr, or Smyrna, under the command 
of the late gallant and much lamented Patterson, ready to watch over the commerce of our country 
during the vicissitudes of the European and Asiatic war — a war which Sir Edward Coddrington so 
soon brought to an end by the tremendous battle of Navarino. The late William the Fourth, of 
England, was at that time one of the admirals to execute the duty of the lord high admiral of Great 
Britain ; and upon one of the official documents, dictated by diplomacy, and worded in the cold and 
formal style of state papers, which issued from ihe admiralty, he had, in pure deviltry, written " Goi. 
it, Ned." The companion of the prince understood the hidden meaning of his royal messmate, and 
on the 20th of October, 1827, the Dartmouth having returned to the fleet, from Navarino, with an 
unsatisfactory reply from Ibrahim Pasha, admiral Coddrington made the signal to the combined fleets 
to get under weigh, and immediately the English, French, and Russian squadrons tripped iheir an- 
chors, and, spreading out their immense clouds of canvas to the breeze, bore up for Navarino bay. 
The Asia led the van, followed by the fleet in two columns. Abreast of the English admiral dashed 
the French three-decker, with a large white flag — or, as the American sailors used to teim it, the 
admiral's table-cloth — hanging at her mizen ; and next, the Genoa, with the black eagles of the 
czars floating over hei poop. Beautiful was the sight ! The shores of Greece were before them — 
the dark blue mountains of the classic land rose in the distance, and a silver veil hung carelessly 
over their giant heads. The town and castle smiled amid the foreground of the landscape, and the 
Turkish tents, like a flock of sheep, rested upon the mountain side. A wreath of smoke hung over 
a neighboring village, and a body of Turkish horsemen returning slowly to camp, told but too well 
the cause of that symbol of destruction. 

It is not my intention to describe the battle of Navarino. I shall therefore leave the gallant fleet 
entering the harbor, in face of the Turkish and Egyptian fleets, drawn up in the form of a crescent 
to receive it, and return to our solitary frigate, whose stars and stripes waved proudly amid the gor- 
geous banners of the nations of the eastern world — amid the brightness of a Grecian sky. Morn- 
ing dawned upon the Asiatic, and the rays of the ascending sun tipped with gold the mountains of 
Natolia, and flashed in splendor from the mosques and minarets of Smyrna. The Constitution now 
began to make signals for getting under weigh — already the blue peter floated at the foie, and the 
heavy thirty-two pounder echoed the captain's order, " Come aboard," in a voice of thunder, to the 
lagging midshipman on shore, when a steamer, under French colors, entered the gulf, and passed 
swiftly in towaids the anchorage. As she swept by the Constitution, she hailed her, and the asto- 
nishing news of the unexpected battle burst upon the ears of the American officers. As might well 
be expected, as soon as the news got wind on shore, the English, French, and Russian residents de- 
parted on board of the vessels of their respective nations, leaving the American frigate almost alone 
in the port, and the American residents about the only Franks in the city of Smyrna. Captain Pat- 
terson immediately repaired to the divan of the bashaw, and while ship after ship of other nations 
dipped their topsails in the waves, the American frigate furled her loosened sails, hauled down her 
signal of departure, and rested in majesty alone. 

The Turks had not expected such boldness — exasperated as they were almost to madness, and 



OLD IRONSIDES. 301 

every hour goaded on to revenge tlie insult offered to their flag, by the arrival of some shattered bark- 
from the scene of action, black with smoke, and wet with blood. A tumult raged in Smyrna; many 
an English and French residence was sacked ; the flags of foreign nations floated no longer upon 
the Morena, with the exception of the banner of freedom that waved over the portals of the Ameri- 
can consulate. Smyrna seemed to be on the eve of a dreadful massacre — " and women wailed and 
children shrieked in fear." 

Firm and undaunted, however, the gallant Patterson and his suite presented themselves at the 
palace of the bashaw, and demanded an audience. It was granted, and the x\merican officers were 
soon in the presence of the incensed governor. 

Around the entrance, stood the bow-string and the bastinado executioners, and the heavy scyme- 
tars that flashed by the side of ihe black slaves, spoke but too plainly the fate that awaited many an 
innocent citizen of the Turkish town. Pipes and sherbet were presented to the visiters in due 
form, and after a few salutations, the American captain demanded to know the intentions of the ba- 
shaw in relation to the American residents. 

This was bringing matters to a crisis in a style unusual in Turkish diplomacy ; but considering 
the boldness of the asker, and the faith reposed in the honor of the Turks by the American citizens 
who remained there, the bashaw relaxed his haughty brow, the scowl of anger left his countenance, 
and rising to his feet, he reached out his hand to captain Patterson, and exclaimed — " Bona Ameri- 
cana, let the consul hoist his flag over the dwellings of his countrymen, and they shall be protected." 

Noon came, and the excitement began to die away — anger now gave way to sorrow — vessel after 
vessel of the dead and the dying came into port, and ere the Muezzin called the hour of evening 
prayer, the weeping of the mourner was heard amid the tombs of the cypress groves, and the tears 
of woman fell upon the scarred and gory features of her dead husband. 

At midnight, the fears of the residents being quieted, and the captain feeling impelled to ferret out 
a Greek pirate in the straits of Sc'o, the Constitution unmoored and got under weigh, and at day- 
light, she passed the anchorage of Vourla, and stood siientl}- down the Levant. After seeing much 
hard service, and clearing the Mediterranean of the nest of pirates that infested its solitary isles, the || 

old frigate took her departure for the United Stiites, and on the 4th of July, 1S2S, amid the festivi- | 

ties of our national birth-day, she came to an anchor off the Navy Yard at Charlcstown, Massachu- 
setts, and fired a salute of twenty-four guns. 



LOSING HER FIGURE HEAD. 

Night reigns upon the stormy coast, 
The sentry sleeps beside his post, 
The lightning glares, the thunder rolls. 
And rats, half-drowning, quit their holes. 

Society is composed of eccentricities and ordinaries. Like an old Dutch clock, it has its big- 
weights and its little weights, its large wheels and its small wheels, its hour and its minute hands, 
its escapement and its regulator, its keys and its winding-up aflairs, and, above all, its enormous pen- 
dulum ; and notwithstanding it is constantly running down, it never stops, but being well oiled, it 
creaks, and ticks, and whizzes, and strikes, with a regularity only equalled by its constant want of 
repairs. Its face is brazen, its top is all sun or all moon, and its bottom is as useless as its super- 
structure is valuable. Its sohtary angel is a gilded one, and its brightest polish a coat of varnish. — 
Under such circumstances, is it strange that some persons should be found ready to serve the devil 
for fun's sake — or to trij) up their grandmother's heels just for the purpose of having a laugh at 
her awkwardness in rising ? 

It was the 3d of July, 1834. Night was slowly settling upon the good people of Massachusetts 
Bay, and dark rolling clouds, tossed by the whirlwind and rent by the bursting water-spout, hung 
over the harbor of Boston, and shut out the beautiful islands from the gaze of the spectator. Bright 
streams of liquid lightning singled out the most prominent objects in the distance, and the long hol- 
low thunder held an awful dialogue with the breakers on Chelsea beach. A brassy cloud hung over 
the setting sun, and the state house of the neighboring city seemed melting into sky, as the low^ 
white breath of the thunder-cloud played with the chimney pots on the tops of the houses, and wreath- 
ed around the little spire, like whifls of tobacco smoke around the peaked cap of Soutcr Johnny. 

Anxious mothers were seen looking out of half-closed doors for truant children and lagging hus- 
bands. Chamber windows were shut by frightened chambermaids, as if by magic. Timid matrons 
smothered themselves in huge feather beds, and cowardly children put their fingers in their ears and 
hid in the clothes-presses and dark corners of their mothers' bed rooms. 

A few lamps glimmered, so as to let the people see how wet they got in walking a given distance 
as they passed along the streets. Lower-story window-blinds were closed, to prevent the lightning 



302 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

from knowing that some people burnt candles during the gust ; and stray dogs, with their tails " hard 
up," streaked it along the streets like express mails in the back settlements. 

Take it all and all, it hid fair to be a gulf-stream night of the first ivaier, and such an one as the 
inhabitants of the earth undoubtedly experienced before the morning watch of the ark of Noah took 
a final departure from the highest mountain peak of Asia, and scudded over a deluged world. 

Old Ironsides — for we have come to her at last — having been thoroughly repaired in her hull, and 
having had a splendid figure of Old Hickory stationed at her bows, now lay moored at the Navy 
Yard a-t Charlestown, between two seventy-fours — the Columbus and the Independence — and await- 
ed her commission. The cabin light of the commander of the Receiving Ship fell broad upon the 
threatened figure-head, and a marine, with a loaded musket, with fixed bayonet, paced along the heel 
of her bowsprit. Surely in such a night, and with such safeguards, no mortal could be silly enough 
to deem her in the least danger of a visit from the spoiler. Human reason and human experience 
went against such a supposition, and therefore, when the ship's bell tolled eight, " the sentry walked 
no more his rounds," but, if common fame be true, (which, by the way, is often an inveterate liar,) 
he pillowed his head on the softest plank in the solitary gun-deck, and slept beneath his post. 

There was at that time in Boston, a perfect dare-devil of a seaman, from Barnstable, or some- 
where else, who had been a commander of a vessel, and whose propensity for a frolic often led him 
into dangers as uimecessary as they were uncommon. This seaman, whose name was Dewey, and 
who said he was friendly to the administration, had heard a great deal said about the figure-head, 
and feeling a desire to see it closely, and wishing, at the same time, to prove to the natives that 
some things could be done — even in a midnight thunder-storm — as well as others, he waited until 
ten o'clock of the evening above mentioned, and then, with a tarpaulin hat and monkey jacket Upon 
his Hpper man, he put a handsaw under his arm, and took a stroll along the deserted wharves of the 
thunder-echoing city. 

Having taken a ship's boat without sails, he sculled up stream Until the lightning showed him the 
arches of the old Charles River Bridge — which, by the way, are square — and then, shipping his rud- 
der, and seating himself in the stern-sheets of the boat, he floated swiftly down upon the top of the 
tide, and made fast to the gallant frigate's hawser. 

The storm had now come on in its fury. Darkness, dreadful as the shades of Erebus, rested on 
the scene, except when the red chain lightning ran down the mountain side of clouds, and crinkled 
along the diverging conductors that protected the roofs of tlie giant ship-houses. The rain fell in 
buckets full, and puft's of almost resistless wind rocked the old hulks beside the wharf, and rattled 
their mooring chains in stormy glee. 

Drenched with rain, baffled by the wind, and almost blinded by 'the vivid lightning, the adventu- 
rous spoiler hauled his boat under the bows, mounted to the bowsprit of the frigate, and sawed away 
at the head of the wooden figure. 

The rain, as it ran down the wood, made his saw Cut still and deep, and having scalped the vete- 
ran, the daie-devil of the day, or (more correctly speaking) the night, bagged the trophy, and let 
himself down into his water-logged boat. Soon he pulled across the river, and leaving his boat at a 
great distance from its parent vessel, he made for his boarding-house, and upon ascending to his 
chamber, locked the head in his chest, and went to sleep. 

Morning came upon the sleeping city and its environs, as beautiful and balmy as the evening pre- 
vious had been wild and cheerless; and when the first ray of the rising sun tipped the heights of 
Woburn and Cambridge, hundreds of heavy cannon, and scores of deep-toned bells, ushered in the 
anniversary of Freedom's Jubilee. The sentry on duty on board the frigate now began to cast Sus- 
picious glances towards the head. Sawdust was strown in rich profusion round the head rail, and 
the flat neck showed evidence of a nocturnal application of cold steel. Long and anxiously did the 
guard look at the object of his solicitude, and feeling certain that foul plai/ had ha.d full play during 
his watch, he said nothing about the circumstance, but shouldered his musket, saluted the corpofral 
of the guard as he brought him his relief, and followed him to the garrison. 

Feeling desirous of hearing the moining salute at the dock yard, and being weary of the turmoil 
&lt;of the night, the captain of the Receiving Ship arose from his pillow, and looked out upon the dt ;p. 
A slight haze was floating swiftly along the water. The flags on the distant shipping waved grace- 
fully amid the fog, like banners amid the clouds of battle : and now the Eric sloop of war sheeted 
home her topsails, and swung round upon her heel, while her parting thunder-note died in echoes 
along the babbling shores. Having looked around upon the gay scenes before him, and having gra- 
tified a seaman's curiosity, vyhich is far inferior, under any circumstances, to that of the backwoods- 
man, the commander of the Columbus was about to turn upon his heel, when his eye rested upon 
the mutilated figure-head of the Constitution. He thought at first that it was an optical illusion. 
He looked again — it could not be — the top of the veteran's shoulders was as flat as a'pancake, and the 
glory of the watch had departed. Soon an official report was made to the commanding ofScer of 
the station, and after a fruitless endeavor to discover the perpetrator of the midnight outrage, a piece 
of canvas was nailed over the figure-head, and the sentinel was sent to the barracks. 

Some months afterwards. Old Ironsides sailed for New York, and as she left the port of Boston, 



DISAPPOINTMENT. 



303 



I discoveretl that a fine striped flag enveloped the mutilated figure, and that her parting salute was 
fired towards Williams' Island. Whether these things meant any thing or not, I leave for those of 
more experience to guess. Upon her aiiival at New York, the covering was removed, a new head- 
piece was clapped upon the figure, and the gallant frigate went upon her ocean way rejoicing. 

But where was Dewey all this tiuie 1 Where the successful adventurer, who, in spite of rain and 
wind, and darkness and lightning, and leaping wave and rolling thunder, and sentinels and sea- 
watches, had mounted the forecastle of Old Ironsides undiscovered, and had sawed oiT, in journey- 
man style, the much-talked-of figure-head"? 

He tossed to and fro in his truckle bed, in broken slumbers. Now half-awake, he began to re- 
flect of the risk that he had run, of the crime that he had committed — for it was a crime to mutilate 
a national vessel. Then, as he dozed more soundly, district attorneys and United States' marshalls 
floated before his eyes ; every shadow seemed to betoken the awful presence of deputy Bass, and 
the bag of wool in the corner seemed to be the district judge in his bob wig, while a row of empty 
porter bottles, in an old lemon box by the fire-place, seemed to be the gentlemen of the jury, duly 
impannelled, and waiting to be charged. At length, a flash of light, followed by the heavy roar of 
the morning gun, fully aroused him. He started from his bed, put on his Sunday suit, pocketed a 
shirt from his trunk, called in a brother lodger, and making known to him the circumstances of his 
midnight undertaking, left the head in his charge, and repaired to the city of New York. In this 
mighty London of the west, many adventures befel him, which I purposely omit, but which I may 
relate hereafter. 

After some months had passed away — when Old Ironsides returned from France — I met Dewey 
in one of the Broadway hotels, near the city hall, and received from his own lips an account of the 
manner in which he had performed his perilous enterprise — an enterprise which, in a good cause, 
would have covered him with fame, and added to the stock of his country's glory. He informed me 
that he had carried the head to Washington, confessed his ofience to the head of the navy depart- 
ment, and left the trophy in its charge. 

Several years have elapsed since our meeting. I took no minutes of his communication .at the 
time, and have had to depend upon memory alone for my incidents. I have endeavored to give a 
trtie, though playful account of the manner in which he performed his service ; and, with this dis- 
elaitaer, I bid good-bye to the decapitator of the Constitution.

BT MISS SARAH L. LAMBERT, FRAXKFOKD, PA. 



I'ye wandered oft with careless feet 

Where flowers were blooming bright and fair. 
And breathing perfume wild and sweet 

Upon the soft and balmy air ; 
But when I stooped and fondly nurs'd 

One little plant with watchful eye, 
Soon as its buds began to burst, 

'Twould droop and die. 

I've gazed at midnight on the skies. 

When countless planets brightly shone. 
While in my heart calm thoughts would rise, 

Inspired by their sweet light alone ; 
But when I marked a star more clear, 

Or shining more serenely bright. 
Oft would a gloomy cloud appear, 

And veil its light. 

I've been surrounded oft by those 

Who while my heart was light and gay, 

And no fond thoughts for them arose. 
Would pass before me day by day ; 

VOL. V. NO. TI. IT 2 



But when I learned for them to wear 
The smile to friendship ever dear. 

Then some far land would win them there, 
Or death was near. 

O ! when the youthful fancy flings 

A brightness over days to come. 
And when the heart's imaginings 

Are all untouched by giief or gloom — 
Ah ! then how often must we see 

The storms of sorrow rise and rage, 
Blotting each joyful memory 

From life's sweet page. 

Delusive are our hopes and joys. 

False as the sunlight on the sea — 
A word, a look, our peace destroys, 

And life is naught but vanity. 
There's but one ra}' that — fadeless, pure — 

Can light with joy the troubled eye ; 
'Tis that blest hope that shall endure 

Beyond the sky. 



THE LUMP OF GOLD 



BEAUCHAMP JONES, THILABA, 



CHAPTER I. 

"Farewell, Mary!" 

" Good bye, George — you must think of me often." 

" Think of thee, Mary 1 I can think of o?z/y thee, the queen of all my biightest hopes. By day, 
when we wandered along the clear stream together, thou wert ever the smiling genius of my youth- 
ful heait — the only one who could beguile my weary spirit during the relaxation between my 
studies — and at the solemn hour of midnight, when reclining on my lonely couch, and all was 
silent, save the cricket, which chirped from the hearth within, and the constant song of the katy-did 
from the rose-bush under my window, without — when the slanting rays of the silvery moon stole 
through the pane, and illumined the chamber with soft enchanting light — in such an hour have my 
eyes voluntarily opened, and in the indistinct figures around, pictured the forms of celestial images — 
and thou, ever thou, wert the directing angel of the scene — the fixed star of my destiny !" 

" George ! — the carriage waits — but I will write to you soon — and thou must come and see me, 
and we will speak of our old haunts. Indeed I will never forget thee. Be not so sad, dear George !" 

" Maiy, were it bad fortune had befallen thee, I should be merrier — I should then never be 
separated from thee." 

" Dost thou think my good fortune will estrange me 1 Believe it not, George. It may be possible 
we will be much separated during the next few years — but when I shall have acquired the education 
which they say is necessary to be accomplished, and thou hast distinguished thyself at the bar, which 
thy genius must some day effect — then, George, no one can object to our meeting to part no more. 
Farewell !" A pressure of the hand in silence, and they were separated for many a long day. 

The sun sank gradually down the west and vanished — but still the youth remained motionless, 
Ms arms folded on his breast, and his eyes turned towards the city which could be distinguished in 
the distance, whither the companion of his happy childhood was suddenly destined to take up her 
future abode. 

The father of George was a poor but contented man — his only possession a few acres, the cultiva- 
tion of which was his dependence for a support. His wants were few, and his frugality afforded a 
plentiful supply. He had once been a wealthy man, and in the wreck of his fortunes retained a 
philosophic equanimity of temper, and preserving a clear conscience through all the perplexities of 
bankruptcy, he breathed calmly, ever reposing the utmost confidence in a future state of felicity, 
which he hoped his actions and meditations would secure to him. When bidding the scene of his 
misfortunes a lasting adieu, accompanied by his little George, (his wife being dead,) and reflecting 
on the probable destiny of his child, he was accosted by a little orphan girl, whom he had frequently 
noticed with peculiar interest, who now wept piteously, and desired to bfe taken along with him. 
Little George seconded the entreaty, and she was accordingly added to the party. Mary was soon 
so beloved that she was regarded as one of the family, and long this trio enjoyed uninterrupted 
happiness. 

At the age of sixteen George evinced so great a disposition to study, that his father, whose economy 
had now considerably replenished his purse, treated with a professional gentleman in the city to 
take him into his office for a brief term of years. George exceeded his parent's most extravagant 
anticipations, and surprised his preceptor by his unprecedented advances in the usually repugnant 
study of the law. Once a week he flew to his father's cottage and kissed his alfectionate Mary, who 
grew in native beauty, and daily improved in intelligence by the instructions of her aged protector. 
George not only studied the works pertaining to his profession, but found time to regale on the 
emanations of mighty geniuses, and thus he revelled in theresplendentfieldsof poesy, felt the ecstatic 
influence of the magic of imagination in the unbounded realms of fiction, and treasured in his 
memory all the most important incidents recorded by the faithful historian. These books he waa 
permitted fo take to Mary, who read them during the intervals of his visits, and thus was engendered 
a congeniality of sentiment which rendered their interviewfs felicitous. And thus their lives con- 
tinued up to the time of their separation. 



THE LUMP OF GOLD. 305 

George bad outstripped his years — passed his examination ttiumphantly, and now only waited 
to arrive at the age required by law to enter on the practice cf his profession. The few months to 
intervene before he could be admitted to the bar, he resolved to pass at the cottage with Mary and 
his fond parent, araid his pleasing books, and the various sweet flowers. His father smiled on him 
a father's welcome, and Mary culled the most beautiful roses, and read to him the most thrilling 
passages of the bard of Avon, the great poet of Nature, and thus their hearts exulted with a rapture 
known only to youth, an atrial enjoyment like some intermediate existence between heaven and 
earth, which endures not, and is only remembered as some pleasurable dream. Yet it is real happi- 
ness to the recipients for the time being, for they dream not of the bitterness of maturer years. 

It was in the midst of these halcyon days that Mary was sought out by a rich relative, who had 
never condescended to notice the sufferings of her parents whilst living, but at the termination of 
his miserly life (hard hearted old misers are never held in grateful remembrance after they are dead,) 
sought to atone for his neglect by heaping an overgrown fortune on the abandoned orphan. Having 
removed her to the city and appointed a wealth-giasping guardian, he yielded up his detestable life,. 



CHAPTERII. 

A TEAR had passed, and the father of George was among the lamented dead. Although the 
grieved youth frequently heard from Mary, yet during the whole twelve months he had not spoken 
to her, nor seen her but for a moment at a time, as her carriage rattled past to some fashionable 
party. Still he could not believe her disinterestedness and simplicity were changed to pride and 
folly. Her notes breathed the same familiar and affectionate tone of the frank and devoted girl. Yet 
George was very unhappy. His success was any thing but encouraging in the courts where so many 
heads had grown gray in the practice. He was embarrassed in his finances, and having in vain en- 
deavored to dispose of his few paternal acres, he now drooped over the sad contemplation of im- 
pending difficulties. And dreary is the one dependent on a selfish world for support, whereiw he 
has neither kin nor any one to feel an interest in his welfare. And far more dreadful is this utter 
loneliness to the virtuous being ; he feels that he deserves a station and a happiness which he can- 
not attain — and ho beholds others in posession who do not merit them. The evil one is contaminated 
by no bad company, but ready for any fellowship, and but little apprehension for the future preys 
upon his spirits. Bui the honest will be rewarded, and the wicked punished, in a future state of 
existence. 

His incessant studies had stamped a thoughtful expression on the features of George, and his 
■wardrobe betrayed the want of replenishing in his threadbare dress. But he felt no disgrace in the 
disparity of costume, even at the moment some finely-attired beau flitted before him, for he enjoyed 
a pride in the consciousness of superior intellect. He imagined (and often truly,) that the butterfly 
of the day sported the sum total of his treasure in his gaudy wings — and he would fain believe that 
his was an inexhaustible wealth of mind. Thus, notwithstanding frequent clouds of despondency 
hung darkly over him, still there were moments when his ardent fancy painted triumphs of the 
noblest kind, when his spirits were on the wing, and his eye lit up with an almost preternatural 
brightness. 

It was under tlie influence of these feelings that he left his office one pleasant evening in summer, 
for the purpose of taking a solitary stroll, and indulging the splendid train of images which his teem- 
ing mind seemed prone to exhibit in successive reveries. He passed through street after street — 
traversed densely thronged promenades and thinly populated alleys, without heeding the jargon of 
voices around him, and his eye arrested not even by the beautiful or grotesque. 

Long he continued his measured pace, unconscious of his destination, and forgetful of the link 
that bound him to his grovelling species. jfVt length he paused in front of a row of snow-white 
marble buildings, his ear attracted by a strain of sweet melody, and his imagination seized in its 
erratic flight by that soothing power which is said to have moved even stocks and stones — to listen. 
Harmony is an attribute of Nature : the music of the spheres and the warbling of the bird attest it. 
Its vibrations most powerfully affect the upright and sympathising heart : the man who is guided by 
the holy impulses of nature, feels his soul swell within him when his ear is regaled by soft melo- 
dious tones. But the base man of coppers is delighted with no sounds but the jingle of coins. 

George rested his arm on the railing of one of the princely habitations before him, and gazed up 
at the million twinkling stars. Although his ear was charmed with earthly tones, yet with his eyes- 
fixed above, he associated them with heavenly visions. 

Ere long his meditations were startled by a rustling of satin on thebalcorry hard by, and he beheM' 
a female richly attired, standing but a few paces distant, her brow clasped by her ivory hand, and 
sighs proceeding from her unquiet breast. Regarding her intently, a few moments sufficed to reveal 
to him his long adored Mary I Undecided whether to accost her, or to retreat unperceived, he is- 
mained motionless and silent, until he distinctly heard her utter the following words — 

" I will sing no more — the song reminds me of George, and I am sad to think he cannot be witl 



306 burton's gentleman's magazine, 

me as formerly ! What has become of him ] Can he suppose my good fortune has made me forget 
him 1 Whatever frivoUties my gay associates may urge me into, I am sure, at least, that I shall never 
cease to think of George !" 

" I thank thee, Mary !" responded George. 
" Who art thou 7 Art George 1" 
" Ay, Mary — dost thou not know mel" 

" Yes! I know thy voice — come within, and I will introduce you to my newfiiends. Oh, George, 
I have often been very unhappy to think thou wert so long away ! They tell me I must not think 
of thee, because thou ait poor, and my guardian asserts his power over my actions, and the swarm 
of my never before heard of relations drag me from one amusement to another, and continually in- 
troduce me to their ^reo^ people, whose etiquette and unmeaning forms are not half so pleasing to 
toe as our old unrestrained sociability i" 

They proceeded to the rooms where the fashionable guests were assembled, arrayed in costly ha- 
biliments for the occasion, the head nodding to head, the eye in quest of peculiarity of dress, or de- 
formity of person, and the tongue too often running riot with scandal. 

When Mary attempted to introduce our plain hero to this company, an unequivocal coldness and 
"haughtiness could be observed in the slight attentions he received. This he perceived, but exulted 
the more in the decided pieference shown by Mary, whom he knew to be the centre of attraction. 
She was the greatest fortune in the city, and he rightly conjectured that all the fine gentlemen were 
drawn thither by the potency of her solid charms. But he had loved her in indigence, for herself 
only, and yet indulged the hope that the passion was reciprocal. The sneers and scornful glances 
-of the perfumed beaux and detracting belles, only stimulated him the longer to protract his conver- 
sation in a half undertone with Mary. Hei eyes sparkled with remembrance and her brow flushed 
■with delight, when he reminded her of their many rambles along the verdant banks of the winding 
rivfer — the books once read together, and all the various flowers they admired in childhood. She 
yielded to the interest of the subject, and the fascinating tones of her youthful companion so absorbed 
her fancy, that her attention was for an unusual length of lime withdrawn from the rest of the party, 
and her presence of mind only regained, when she perceived ?^Ir. Gragg, her guardian, advancing 
towards her. 

*' Mr. Gragg, permit me to introduce George — Mr. George ." 

George rose and bowed, but Mr. Gragg's eyes were riveted, in astonishment, on his ward. After 
a significant stare, the watchful guardian, who considered himself fully authorised to select the ac- 
quaintances whom Mary should entertain, withdrew without bestowing the least attention on the 
mortified student. But the blushing girl continued the conversation with redoubled earnestness, 
although she was unable to conceal her wounded feelings. 

The next effort to separiite the heiress from the vulgar intruder was successful. Some half dozen 

of her adulating cousins came round and reminding her of an appointed lounge with Major , 

or game of chess with Colonel , swept her away by force, leaving our hero the only occupant 

of the now deserted room. The servants peeped in and chuckled. Bursts of uproarious laughter 
Were heard in the adjoining apartments — and George felt that his poverty debased him in the eyes 
of the world. He was also pained to recognise in Mary's guardian, the rich banker to whom he had 
once made an unsuccessful application to raise funds on the cottage and grounds left him by his 
father. But what was yet more poignant, he had accepted an offer made by advertisement, to 
transcribe some documents of official correspondence, the recompense but a trifling sum, but his 
exigencies requiring it — and his employers were the Major and the Colonel to whom Mary attempted 
to introduce him that night ! He recollected the curl of the lip at the recognition, and the smile of 
derision as they withdrew ! 

George remained some moments alone in painful and intense anxiety: he hoped that Mary would 
break away from her officious companions, if but for an instant, to reassure him that he held a place 
in her regard — and, pained with fear that her young heart might eventually be estranged, and her 
memory be gradually weaned from old recollections. She came not — and when he rose with a heavy 
spirit to depart he cared not whither, a servant entered with his hat, which George threw violently 
on his head, and abruptly rushed away. 

Again our hero strode onward, bestowing no notice on the thousands he overtook and passed, 
with a far more miserable breast than before he entered the rich man's dwelling. Magnificent creations 
of the imagination no more beguiled his fevered head — but the reality of his unenviable condition 
flashed upon him. He possessed not five dollars in the wide world — he was despised by those whom 
he had never harmed — and in all probability abandoned by the only being he loved. With the 
harrowing feelings of utter loneliness, he directed his weary steps towards the peaceful cottage 
■where he had so often been joyous in infancy, hoping to pluck a cheering thought, or a balm among 
the dew-besprinkled roses, to allay the burning of his throbbing temples. 

He lifted the latch of the cottage door, but all was dark and silent within, like some deserted 
tenement of a past generation ; it was awful and still as a mouldering sepulchre ! A chillness fell 
.upon his breast, but his brain was in frantic commotion. He rushed away, striding through the 



THE LUMP OF GOLD. 307 

neglected garden, and paused not until the grave of his father aircsted his steps. He gazod upon 
the green mound and seemed to hold communion with its solitary tenant. 

" Thou art at rest, father !" he said in tones of thrilling solemnity — " yes, thou art at rest. The 
humiliation of penury — stings of malice — scoffs of the proud — deceptions of friendship — fickleness 
of love — all arc nothing to thee now ! The racking agony of crushed ambition is unknown to 
thee — no more cherished hopes can be disappointed — oh! — that I were cold and pangless — slumber- 
ing at thy side a slilfencd corse ! Oh, that I too were dead !" He ran to a wild summit jutting 
above the wmding stream which murmured among the rocks some fifty feet below. He paused at 
the very verge and glared at the waters, wherein the starry heavens were reflected, and he was 
tempted to make a leap, which his frenzy intimated would hurl him into the eternal skies, and for 
ever release him from the shackles of a tormenting world. He flew back a few paces — paused, and 
then sprang forward with a determination to plunge into the undescribed eternity — when his foot 
becoming entangled, he was piostrated so near the edge of the precipice that his head hung over the 
descent. Not yet deterred from his desperate purpose, he struggled to cast himself off — but was still 
withheld by the obstruction mentioned, which seemed to be planted firmly in the earth. He drew 
back to disengage himself, when he discovered the object which thwarted his will, to be a heavy hoe, 
which some hand had stricken so deeply into the ground that it was almost impossible to remove it, 
and there it was providentially suffered to remain. Sanity now resumed its empire, and our hero 
reflected upon the act he was about committing. Reflection in such cases is salvation, for the act 
IS never done deliberately. When the head can reason cooly, the hand can never be raised rashly 
for self-destruction, 

" Heaven be thanked," cried he, " that I have been prevented from accomplishing my unnatural 
purpose ! I tremble now, even to think of the horrible thing I was intent upon doing ! Should a 
young man, possessing perfect health and bodily vigor, despair in this changeful world 1 Shall the 
vexation of the moment subdue my spirit, and make me a miserable victim of melancholy ever 
after 1 No ! Here I seize upon this good implement of labor, and I stand henceforth an independent 
man upon my own soil ! Here I cast the worthless objects of fell -ambition to the fleeting winds, 
and in future will engage in the rational pursuit of peace and humble contentment. My stout limbs 
shall procure me a sustenance, and my books shall yield amusement. Here will I abide, the solitary 
and happy ascetic. I will find fellowship in the inexhaustible resources of mind, and repose in the 
peaceful pulsations of an honest heart. Fool that I was to entertain a thought of suicide, when I 
could work!" Saying this, he sprang up, wrenched the hoe from its confinement, and struck it 
again into the green sod — but when he attempted to repeat the blow something beneath the surface 
which the iron penetrated, prevented him from raising the instrument for some moments. He suc- 
ceeded in extricating it, however, and repeated the blow with still greater force, some inches distant 
from the spot indicated before, but it again clung to the same hidden substance. 

George's heart almost failed him in his first effort to reduce his resolution to practice — but not to 
be so suddenly driven into a relinquishment of his chimera, he threw off his coat and determined to 
see what it was that thus impeded his exertions. In a very few minutes he had the earth removed 
from the object in question, which he discovered to be an immense mass of metal, that his whole 
strength was insufficient to remove from its bed. He then struck it with the blunt part of the hoe, 
and the dust falling away, revealed to his astonished vision (the moon being risen above the city and 
shining brightly,) a glittering body which his joyful imagination whispered was gold ! He endeavored 
to prize the treasure from its location, but this too, from its great weight, he was unable to accom- 
plish. Throwing aside his hat in his struggles, he perceived a folded note fall from it, which he had 
no previous knowledge of, and though he saw by the light of the moon it bore his name on the 
back, yet being too intent in the more important affair, he thrust it back, to be perused at a more 
leisure moment. He succeeded in chipping off a small particle from the huge lump, and replacing 
the sod, set off for the city, with the specimen clenched in his hand. 

His brisk step soon brought him to the great metropolis, and he proceeded without consulting any 
one else, to the director of the mint. 

"What is the matter 1" demanded that gentleman, observing the anxious looiis of our hero, whose 
heart could be distinctly heard to beat. 

" Look at this !" said George, thrusting the specimen into the gentleman's hand. 

" Well, there's not more than a pennyweight." 

" Is it gold 1" demanded George. 

" Pooh ! you don't expect this is a fortune 1" 

" Is it gold /" shouted George. 

" Assuredly, but this is a very smalt quantity," replied the gentleman, handing it back to our 
hero, who now calmly smiled, having entirely recovered his self-possession. 

George then briefly related his discovery, and that night the director accompanied him to the 
cottage, followed by a strong dray, which was to transport the great treasure to the mint. 

When they arrived at the summit on the bank of the river, George ran forvyard and found every 
thing in the same condition as he left it. He removed the sod and displayed to the delighted eyes

of the man of coins, a huge misshapen mass of solid gold. It was heaved into the dray without loss 
of time, driven to the city, and deposited in the mint for instant coinage. 



CHAPTER III. 

The next morning our hero rose from his couch a happy man ; for after all, the most exquisite 
enjoyment is of the mind — and to dwell in anticipation of certain good is more than equal to the 
actual possession. He now broke open the mysterious note, which he was delighted to find came 
from Mary, whom he had more than once feared would soon learn to look with contempt on his 
hopeless poverty. She had hastily penned the epistle, and thrusting it into his hat, which had been 
left in the entrance to the chamber, sent it to our hero by the servant. The lines informed him 
that her heart v^as unchanged and unchangeable — and when the legal period should place her be- 
yond the domination of her guardian, she would instantly become George's wife, if he desired it 
This was new rapture for our hero, and he again upbraided his impetuosity, which was well nigh 
defeating all the good intended him. 

Satisfied of the faith of his Mary, our hero now set al)out meditating what should be the first step 
he must take. He recollected having enjoined the strictest secrecy on the officers of the mint in re- 
gard to his sudden acquisition, and he now resolved to discover his wealth to the world in his own 
peculiar way. A smile played on his lip as he arrayed himself in his most homely clothes. When 
his toilet was finished he started forth on foot, and traversed all the streets wherein he was most 
likely to encounter his old acquaintances. He soon accosted numbers, who merely stared at his 
poverty-stricken tout ensemble, and passed hastily on, as if not wishing to be seen speaking to so- 
miserable an object. George bowed and stepped on, without feeling the least slighted. The next 
persons he met were the Colonel and Major already alluded to, who regarded him with a detecting 
leer of the eye, but hastened on without turning the head. George Vv^as not pained by their con- 
tempt, but diverted at their estimation of his insignificance, and thought he might improve in their 
opinion were they to see his lump of gold. Next, a company of ladies with gorgeous equipage drove 
by, and to his inexpressible joy the lily hand of Mary was waved to him as they flew past. 

Being now in the vicirrity of the mint he stepped in and filled his pockets with the glittei-ing new 
money just made from his lump of gold. He then went to the tailor's, who seeing George enter the 
door, handed out a bill of long standing, which he declared must be settled that day, or our hero 
might look to taste the atmosphere of a prison. George threw him a handful of gold, and Mr. 
Cabbage stared like a wild man. He asserted that he was only joking about having a warrant 
issued — would wait until it was entirely convenient for the gentleman to pay, and hoped to have a 
continuance of his custom. George laughed outright, but paid the debt which had truly been due 
a considerable time, and ordered several costly suits, for which he settled in advance. 

George next purchased a very costly carriage, beautiful horses and trappings, and hired a dozen 
servants. He then authorised his friend, the director of the mint, to purchase him a commodious 
dwelling in the most fashionable part of the city, into which he moved without delay, and in a few 
days w-is established in grand style. 

On the Sabbath our hero drove to church, the same he had ever attended, but where the discern- 
ing sexton had been in the habit of placing him on some mean and obscure bench. When he 
alighted the crowd gave way with instinctive deference, and the gaping door-keeper led him to a 
cushioned seat, and bowing very low, condescended to inquire after our hero's he dth. George felt 
an inclination to tell him to go to the devil, but bridled the impulse. He soon became so great an 
object of curiosity that even the parson was in a measure neglected ; and when the service was over, 
more than a score of young ladies whom he thouglit had long since forgotten him, graciously nodded 
as he passed out to his carriage. The Colonel and Major themselves spoke to him. 

By the next morning George's astounding acquisition was rumored over the city, and before 
evening his residence was beset with applying clients. Mr. Gragg himself waited upon him, and 
now proposed to purchase the cottage. Our hero was not anxious now to part with his few acres, 
but named another affair to Mr. Gragg, who acquiesced in the most obsequious terms, and they 
drove together to his' residence, and that evening oar hero and Mary were united. 

" Now, Mary," said George, when they were seated together after the ceremony was over, " if 
("ood fortune can metamorphose a vagabond into a noble gentleman in the eyes of the world, no doubt 
our old cottage will be considered a magnificent palace." 

"In the eyes of the world, perhaps," replied the happy bride, "but in the eyes of neither you nor 
I does it require a change, to bring back all the cherished recollections of our childhood, and I 
should be delighted to pass all my days in it." 

"Then we will remove thither immediately: and by merely enjoying the desirable comforts of 
life in our retirement, and ministering bountifully to the needy around, will disappoint the venal ex- 
pectations of our many new friends, and study the best means of promoting our lasting happiness." 
The joyful couple retired to the humble cottage ; and though they remained separated from the 
dissipated votaries of fashion, yet they were remembered and respected as the possessors of th

PREDESTINATION 

A MORAL RECORD. 



BT JOHN- T. MAULL, ESQ , PHILADA. 



That the mind is alwa^'s active in the development of whatever carries with it the semblance ot 
mystery, is a moral axiom attested at all times by the perverse folly of mankind ; witness among a 
thousand and one extravagant phantasms, the elaborate research after the philosopher's stone, en- 
grossing the mental energies of the wisest of ancient days. Let experience, whose testimony is the 
strongest, declare that mankind have been more setluced and ruined by the ephemeral fancies of 
theii own brain, than by any mere combination of circumstances, arising out of that prolific theme 
of declamation, the alledged unfitness of things. The Pride of Intellect ! How deeply rooted in the 
frail tabernacle of human life ! Let but some gauzy, mist-like delusion float athwart the tether of 
the imagination, and there will presently appear a cloud, lowering and darkening, until the storm of 
passion shall cast its desolation confusedly around. Strange ! a being endowed with faculties and 
powers that should raise him high above the regions of error, could by their perversion, be so debased, 
aye, bowed in the dust of humiliation. Behold him basking in the torpid and deceptive glare of 
fancied felicity — a blank in creation, oft a burden to himself and useless to his fellows. Should this 
be the measure of his existence 1 yet let m.e ask how numerous these examples 1 Turn again, and 
■view the torrent of impetuous desires, ambitions and revenges, pursuing its headlong career and 
deluging society under the vortigenous gulph of soul sickening crime. Do we shudder at this, and 
inquire the cause? our natural sense whispers the reply, " there has been a perversion — a departure 
from the obvious dictates of reason and morality." Each and every of us have it in our power to 
become what nature has intended us, but, like the generality of those efforts whose aim points to per- 
fection, they require such restriction, privation, and self-tutorship, that few, if any, will be found to 
attempt what they deem impossible to execute. Then, too, the reward is not of a sufficiently daz- 
zling character ; the high and horrored places in the land are not uniformly open to the " great and 
good." Whence, say they, " we lack inducement." Inducement ! what nobler incentive do they 
lequire than that which is nurtured in the holy temple of man's divinity — his conscience ! Let not 
the shallow contemner of virtue or the profligate libertine deride the thought, for says the Bard of 
Nature — 

Conscience hath a thousand several tongues. 
And every tongue brings in a several tale. 

"What has made the crouching sycophant and yielding applauder of other men's conceits and 
foibles 1 — Habitude ! What has trammeled with iron chain the virtuous energies of those who 
have wanted the moral courage to withstand the attack of fashion and vice 1 — Dread of Reproach ! — 
and what is more, I opine that he is a brave man who would undertake to reform in practice, the 
idle ceremonies and cold heartedness of the cunent times. Then let us adopt the sage decree of the 
Celestial empire, and " let no man pretend to be wiser than his fathers." We had better float quietly 
down the crooked stream, than attempt by unassisted effort to stem the tide we are unable to resist, 
and content ourselves with the reflection that just so long as the spring of action is confined for the 
most part within the servile pale of lucre and self-interest, so long from the nature of things, we must 
confidently expect a " crooked and perverse generation." The exalted spirit would aspire to the 
contemplation of what is sublime and praiseworthy around us ; debased, it would grovel in scerres 
that only glitter the more readily to seduce. 

Philosophically writing, what should be the main object of life; ought it not to consist in happi- 
Dessl to obtain this, must we not possess contentment? possessing it in whatever degree we are so 
much the more relatively happy. How many of us, apparently not satisfied with the stem realities 
of actual life, wander about in the mazy labyrynths of the imagination and conjure up idealities, in- 
dulging in dogmas and dreamy abstractions, that gradually exert such powerful influence over the in- 
tellectual and moral faculties, that they impede the growth of correct principle, and oftentimes ter- 
minate to our most serious disadvantage. How often, opinions orrce formed, establish their own 
dominion, and defy the keenest efforts of reason to eradicate. 

The incidents which I am about to unfold, owe their chief interest to this infatuation of the mind. 
Youth and its many fascinations, health, friends, and fortune, were no obstacles to the advance and 
victory of this arch-enemy of our race — it triumphed, trampling down the barriers of the judgment,

as if in solemn mockery of human frailty : — a lesson fraught with leeming instruction to those who 
set up the pretensions of their own powers contrarient to their legitim:ite purview. 

" 'Tis fixed, then, and the unalterable finger of fate points me to my destiny," exclaimed Meron 
abstractedly, and passing his hand across his manly brow. " Men may think me strange, but what 
is to be must be. I am content. Let me reflect upon myself. Has not some spirit written me an 
existence distinct from mine own ? yes ! and it is even sounding in my brain the knell of gloomy 
dissolution. Well ! sound on, and let it come. Death is easily braved. The separation of the soul — 
that epliemeral essence, from this cumbrous clod of mortality, is my eternal welfare. Oh, how I 
revel in the thought ! Yet prate not, proud spirit, of thy daring ; shall words alone belie thy 
cowardice 1 for veil it as thou mayst, there is still a latent feeling quivering in my heart, that 
assures me I am a coward — and forsooth, a knavish one. What is it that appals me thus — 'tis the cer- 
tainty of the issue ! no avoidance, no refuge. Clutched in the grasp of lime, I'm hurried to my 
doom ; the day — the hour awaits when the obhvious gulph shall gorge its victim. Move on, then, 
ye sluggish moments, and seal your reckoning." 

Excited by this mode of soliloquising, to which he Vv-as so frequently addicted, he relapsed into a 
silent dejection, lost to external impression, and awake only to his approaching destiny. Possessed 
of an ardent temperament and buoyant with expectation, a few years before he stood amid his friends 
the dehght of them all ; of a searching and inquiring tone of mind, he had dedicated his energies to 
a close inspection of whatever theory bore upon its face the impress of learning ; his profession he 
had early selected, and at this period, afforded bright promises of distinction in its pursuits. Promises 
sadly to be blighted I From some vague and undefinabie impression he entertained the idea that 
his death would occur on a particular and predestined day, and from this cause alone, arose the 
gloom that shrouded his every thought and action. In those seasons of reverie, no jocund voice of 
friendship could wean him fiom the contemplation of the future. In the ordinary intercourse of life, 
he demeaned himself in all its duties and civilities, in a manner that betokened in him a high siense 
of honor and capacity. Bereft of the fostering influence of relatives, he had in their stead retained 
the confidence of those in whose society the blandishments of his manners and the easy elegance of 
Ms conversation had won for him a regard as pleasing as it was deserved, Meron was one of that 
order of persons whose refined spirit could never brook an action that wore in its semblance the de- 
parture from a manly and honorable course. He paw around him a commingled mass of humanity, 
whose chief object was engrossed in the grovelling pursuit of lucre, and his gouI sickened at what 
he thought their mean and overreaching policy. He had re?id and heard of the veteran who bled 
in the wars of his country, confined within the dungeon walls of a common prison — his crime, ati 
insignificant debt, while the heartless creditor, living under and enjoying the blessings which that 
old man had toiled to achieve, stood by and claimed his own, aye! to the veriest farthing. The 
lonely hearth and squalid tatters of poverty too, were scenes which though he might fain blot thenii 
from his vision, could not be banished from his sympathy. The fell dominion of unbridled vice threW 
a cold, an icy chain around the warm filaments of his heart, that froze it into an apathy for mankind, 
verging almost to hate. His sensitive nature would invariably prompt him to dwell on the dark side 
of every picture, both that he might contemn it, and at the same lime indulge in his reflections on 
the base depravity that he thus saw revealed to him. The position thus assumed, and being an en- 
thusiast in the noble cause of right, and withal possessed of the advantages of youth, education, and 
competency, he determined to have the frown, nay, if need be, the scorn of the multitude, who might 
deride or ridicule his endeavors, recollecting 

'Tis noble to fall in a great attempt. 

His habits consequent upon too much retirement were of a serious bent, and his aptitude for phi- 
losophic research led him to the investigation of most of the principles that form topics for the 
learned. His fault was here — he believed in a certain and fixed destiny, which neither change of 
circumstances or nature of thins;s could affect. This was the root that rankling, festered the goodly 
tiee, just budding forth so fresh with promise. 

" Come, Meron," exclaimed Romond to his friend, " a walk along the river's bank by this glorious 
twiUght hour will be delightful. The cause indeed I cannot divine, it may be from boyish associa- 
tion, or perhaps from congeniality of feeling, but it appears to me that more pleasure is aflTorded to 
me in your society than in all others ; with you I can speak as my heart dictates — and this, too, I 
know, that if a score of accusers should rise up against me, armed with your good opinion, I would 
defy them all : — this I have learnt from friendship." 

Meron to whom this social converse was addressed, was seated in his study occupied in his usual 
leverie. The doctrine of predestination was engrossing his thoughts, and the scattered books and 
papers were commentaries on the elaborateness of his research. For hours in the loneliness of ihat 
closet, apart from society, did this mistaken philanthropist and scholar dream in waking abstraction 
over the probabilities of his theory. As Romond concluded his request, and was about taking him 
by the hand, he was surprised by the wild glare that shone upon him from the full dark eyes of 
Meron; his manner so changed ! Where were now the gentleness and docility, so strongly 66a- 



PREDESTINATION. 311 

trasted with his present aspect. An energetic fire — an inspiration seeOied to possess him as he ex- 
claimed — 

"Thou ait them:m! my destroyer ! Who brought you here? strike, if thou canst ! and then 
proclaim to the world you too have killed afellow-cieature — a friend — a bosom one! noble act ? 
They will applaud you for it: but be sure you fabricate some tale of plausibility — some deceit or 
treachery of mine, which they will credit, and you have gained for yourself a name among your 
fellows. But is this the fated day ! No. Yet there stands my destroyer. Fiend! I defy thee, for 
my time is not yet come, I will abide it." Having concluded this rhapsody, he relaxed not his 
muscles, nor changed the fixed gaze that rivetted Komond to him, but exhausted by the unequal 
efforts of his disordered brain, he relapsed into an almost insensible stupor. Romond supported hiiii, 
and strove to recall his scattered senses; he awoke as from a vision, and complaining momentarily of 
some serious disquietude, inquired — " whether he had been waiting for him long." 

The tie of friendship that cemented the tinion of Meron and Romond was strengthened by every 
feeling of respect and affection. Years had they lived and grown together, their diversions mutual 
and their pursuits blended to the same common end. Continually in each others society, they had 
imagined to themselves a miniature world, wherein they, the chief actors, noted the traits of each 
others character, and so moulded them that the one seemed but a reflection of the other. But here 
they differed. Meron was a Predestinarian. He intuitively believed that that cherished object, his 
boyhood's companion — the sharer of his joys and ills — ^in whom he never knew a wilful act that 
tended to his prejudice — was to be his miirdsrer — that Fate had fixed his time, whose heavy hand 
was to strike him down an unresisting victim. 

'T was twilight ; the liver rippled joyously along in its eddying course, while the dark greein hills 'in 
the vista mellowed by the declining light, weie shadowed forth in all the sombre and holy grandeur 
of the universal spirit. 'Mid this scene of loveliness, the two friends strolled on alive to thefascina- 
tions of the ever opening prospect. Theirs was a mutual pleasure — that of well attuned and sympa- 
thetic spirits. How grateful to them, then, were the thanks of some befriended passer by, who had 
partaken of their charities, extended to him at some crisis of misfortune — or the gladsome laugh of 
childhood, that welcomed them to the cot made happy by their saving relief. These greetings met 
them where'er they turned ; they were the effusions of gratitude from those whose hearts yearned 
in thankfulness for fiivor received. Indeed so much had the manners and actions of these young 
men gained the affections of the neighboiing country people, that their presence Was always the 
foretoken of gladness. How grateful these tributes! Could monarchs command them ? no: this 
homage to virtue might only be envied. Elated by the welcome they received, they strolled along 
the river's edge until an abruptly risin:: eminence caused them to turn aside, and seek the sober 
quiet of an adjacent slope, which studded with rocks and trees, blended the picturesque with the 
dasky grandeui of the outstretched larldscape. In the west yet lingered some liquid tifits of rosy light, 
which bathing the horizon with their heavenlv splendor, seemed to embody forth the spiritual realities 
of the blessed. The soul loves concourse with these ethereal imag^inings, which at times seem to 
afford us a glimpse into the veiled futurity of the grave. Obedient to this impulse, Meron and Ko- 
mond, as day slumbered into night, sat in mute contemplation of the glories that encircled them. 

Meron at length spoke. "Romond I've been bearing a grievous weight upon my mind for years, 
and since now I can speak of it dispassionately in thet ranquillity of this holy hour, bear with me, 
my friend, while I impart its nature. Deride me for entertaining a foible if yon vvill, but teach me 
to forget the theme. I'm a fatalist: my reason convinces me of it; and to shake off the impression 
is for the miserable and condemned captive to sever the chains that bind him to his destiny. A'h 
appointed doom is the common hit. This fair Earth and all its fairer denizens a'C but the harvest- 
field at the ripening of which Time's relentless weapon shall utterly destroy. ' The heavens shall 
be rolled together like a scroll.' Mark the Sacred prophecy. Why 1 — from the beginning 'twas 
ordained. Both revelation and nature inculcate a knowledge of divinity, and the vast complexity of 
things connected with it. Revelation commands us — for it is based on miracle ; human knowledge 
founded on the records of authentic history, sacred and profane, declares this. On the contrary, 
Nature persuades us, addresses our understanding and speaks to our wayward hearts, which respon- 
sive vibrate to the touch, and thus it is, that I see made manifest in colors of living light, the 
infinite goodness of God — the grand sublimity of revealed power — the gentle whisperings of the 
voice of Nature ! God-like agents. Here in this dancing rivulet kissing the dews from off the bend- 
ing flower, may we see portrayed the true picture of simple loveliness — nay, open the book of Nature 
at any page, and there read reaso?i, and ' rise from Nature up to Nature's God.' Romond, inark 
me, there is a lesson to be learnt from a source where men least have recourse to, 

yiU^l 0-S4UTOV. 

'" Turn thyself in upon thyself, and hold commune with that eternal spirit there, which by times 
em'ulates the rage of the devastating storm, or the tranquillity of the sleeping starlight ; oft it assumes 
a middle aspect, and seems to sport the creature of circumstances — now pleased — perplexed — fretful : 
again inquisitive, and seeking by its own agency an insight into the mysteries of the unexplored 
future," 



312 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

" But Meron," responded Romond, " why should you thus embitter your existence by subjecting^ 
your faculties to the ordeal of in vestigating such a subtle essence, nay, I may term it — ideal nonentity^ 
Would you arrogate to yourself powers which belong to God-head alone, and take upon yourself to 
decide on events solely because you have an impression of their happening. Meron, my friend, 
this is madness, and in you, at least, unpardonable." 

" Well, well, chide me for this weakness if you please, but be assured that such root has it taken 
in my brain, that to eradicate it will be to tear up the foundation of my mind, and make me, indeed, 
a moral wreck. Romund, if I am verging to it now, let me know it." 

Momentarily aroused, he spoke with a strange wildness, subdued by a certain self-control. There 
was a pent up storm — a raging within, that seemed to struggle with itself, but suddenly calmed as 
if by the exertion of some superhuman influence. 

" Romond, listen to what I now say, nor start at the recital. You are my fated destroyer ! The 
day, the hour, is fast appioaching, that will witness the act that is to consign me — me, whom you 
have always loved — to the grave. This it is that has lain like a foul incumbus upon me in my 
sleeping hours, and haunted the bright visions of my dreams, until I've sprung from my restless couch 
and struggled with a phantom — it had your garb, face and form, but unlike a murderer, it smiled 
upon me, and seemed to court my favor ; it looked as you now look, and as I scanned the shadowy 
spectre, cold drops of fear oozed from my aching brow. It aimed the deadly weapon, and through 
my curtained sleep, I saw and cowered at — thy pi-csence ! Fm doomed. Romond, tuie as I be- 
hold you I believe me of the certainty of my approaching death, this in itself should not disturb me, 
but when I reflect on the actor — that you should be the perpetrator — you, whom I have so long 
loved — 'tis horror ! and I gasp for breath — the thought chokes my utterance — I despair !" 

Such were his wild rhapsodies, and his impassioned gestures too well gave fearful note of the 
struggling encounter of his feelings. Romond was silent, and absorbed in grief at the recollection 
of the past, and the reality of the present. The disordered state of mind portrayed to him when he 
had called upon his friend that day, coupled with what he had just heard, held his senses in suspense. 
Momentarly he doubted the truth of what had occurred. 

Could it be possible that he to whom he had hitherto looked up to as possessing a mind and heart, 
the one as remarkable for its well regulated strength, as the other for its enduring goodness, should 
be thus fallen ! 

Romond ivept. 

That most pernicious bane to our well being, repose, and governance of our actions — a belief in 
predestination was the canker worm that preyed upon his mind, reducing its symmetry and solidity, 
until the stately edifice tottered under the pressure of its own weight. Such was its effect on Meron, 
a commentary on the weakness and instability of the most gifted capacities, when bereft of the 
simplest elements of common reason. Vainly did Romond philosophize on the wild absurdity of 
what he termed the caprice of his friend. An indifferent and moody abstraction was all that was 
evidenced by Meron to the urgent appeals which Romond's eloquence of soul poured into the hearing 
but not the feelings of the predestinarian. 

Arm in arm they retraced their steps homeward, but with what different emotions. The one like 
a condemned felon, sullenly brooding over the misery of his fate, the other, infusing the balm of 
consolation into the wounded spirit, and seeking to reclaim a friend from error. If we would dilate 
on the affections, that ivy-like entwined themselves around the very existence of these young men, 
we must dwell on their early friendship, and observe how the first mouldings of sympathy, perfected 
that esteem, that mutual pleasure in each other's society, in fine, that holy alliance of their every 
thought and feeling. 

As rivulets fed by continual dews and showers run rippling on, increasing their tiny limits, till 
at length they burst with a joyous bound, and mingle their flowing waters, in the wide expanse of 
the broad and noble stream ; so grew and flourished the intercourse of those thus commingling to- 
gether the bright glad waters of the heart. Time and its changes had wrought no blight in the 
affections thus holily matured, except in the individual sensations of Meron. What behoved to him 
the exhibitions of those vhtues which do honor to man's nature 1 Could Friendship drive off the 
dungeon gloom that pervaded the inmost recesses of his soul. It could not. Despair came to the 
relief of his shattered intellect. 

Some few days after the time of the above narrated incidents, Meron was laid on the bed of sick- 
ness, and when the fever was on him, he would call loudly on Romond, reproaching him for his 
criminal intent, would fasten his clenched hands before his distempered vision, and raving, upbraid 
the partner of his youth for his treachery. The sedulous attention of medical men of the first re- 
pute could not alleviate his condition, or expel the phasma, that in reality was the sole and efficient 
cause of his present woes. Solicitude of the dearest and tenderest kind availed nothing ; in his dis- 
ordered exclamations the eventful period now within a few days of its consummation, was the all 
absarbing topic. His attendants, conscious of the importance of that day in effecting a convalescence, 
used their best endeavors in soothing the irritation of his mind. His companions by his bedside 
strove in gentlest manner to wean him from his infirmity. But his "Romond," " his friend," were 
his only responses. 



PREDESTINATION. 313 

The day anived. From the moment the sun's biight beams struggled thiough the bowed case- 
ment, he assumed the aspect of a strange and subdued terror, as if the epochs of a life were blended 
within the compass of a few short hours. An unnatural fne glowed and glared from his full dark 
eyes that seemed to burn their sockets. Although his room bore the semblance of a living sepulchre, 
such death-like stillness pervaded it, yet ever and anon would he raise his body from the couch and 
hurriedly throwing aside the curtain, peer into the darkness beyond, apprehensive of his doom. 

By the lequiiements of his physician strict care was taken that none be admitted during the day, 
in obedience to which all ingress to his chamber was prevented. 

At home, not far from the residence of his sick friend, sat Romond, v^atching the anxious moments 
as they progressed and eagerly intent on the issue of the trial. He sighed over the scenes that onct 
were, and yet gloried in the anticipations of brightening hopes. 

" Let this day be past," he exclaimed, " and to-morrow restores me to what my heart raostearnest- 
ly craves. Oh, Friendship ! blest of human attributes, what honied drops can'st thou instil into the 
fragrant flowers of the aliections, giving to life the fairest, sweetest fascination. To-morrow ! and 
what a h-.ippy meeting. He convinced of the error of his ways — myself once more returned to the 
place I had held in his regard. Fly on apace, ye sluggish hours, and give to Friendship — its own." 

Filled with such generous emotions did Romond pass that eventful da}\ At length the shadows 
of the night darkened around him, and yet Meron lived ; morning came and with it was witnessed 
the triumph of reason over the errors of predestination. If he had consulted his feelings alone, Ro- 
mond would have rushed to embrace his friend, but was prevented by the solicitation of the physi- 
cian. However he was told that Meron had so far recovered as not to evince a vestige of the phrenzy 
thit had possessed him. To consummate his happiness it only remained for him to congratulate 
Meron on his restoration to health, and thus to cure him of the cause of his illness, an overweening 
telief in predestination. Joyous epoch ! On the evening of that day Romond accordingly left his 
home, and wended his hasty and delighted steps towards the social idol of his thoughts. A slight 
shower had just fallen, and the spangled drops shone like ghstening gems in the cool twilight air, 
while the various rich and waving crops, browning for the harvest, added an entirety to the pleasur- 
able objects around, imparting a serene gratification in the bosom of Romond. " What a world of 
beneficence," exclaimed he, as he walked. " Yes, it must be so, there is a sympathetic cord in our 
natures, degenerate though we be, which vibrates to the song of the soul — a strain of beatitude — a 
heavenly inspiration ; even now I feel it." 

Elated with this hope, he soon arrived at the well known mansion. The customary salutation 
awaited him. All were as happy as renovated hopes could make them. Romond ascended to the 
Toom of his friend. With the door ajar, he gazed in upon him. He slept — a favorable opportunity 
to watch the features of the predestined. That placid serenity which had won over so many to its 
possessor, now glowed over his placid features with ineffable sweetness. 

The dawn of youth's blight season yet gave indication of the full and perfect day of life: and 
oh ! what transport to him who now bent over his couch, were the expression of returning health, 
and the re-establishment of the empire of reason. This to him w-as indeed a feast of the affections — 
a day dream of resplendent promise. He spoke to him in kindly accent, in soothing manner took 
his hand, and pressed it to his own. 

Meron slowly awoke — stared vacantly on Romond — groaned, then daiting upon him, with tiger- 
like ferocity, with maniac violence, clutched him by the throat ! Soul-sickening scene ! The 
frenzied fatalist, as if to vie with the blackened guilt of the first fraternal sin, screamed defiance over 
the person of his prostrate, bleeding victim; it seemed as if the king of darkness had been invoked to 
consummate an act at which humanity recoils. Grasping a pistol, which lay concealed under his 
pillow, he aimed it — fiied ! — and thus by his own hand fell the bosom companion of his early years : — 
he, who was the predestined murderer of yesterday, was the confiding and slaughtered friend of to- 
day. The fruit of Predestination — destroyer of every virtuous and moral incentives to our actions. 
What shall we say of the perpetrator? — this — that from that moment — he was a raving madman. 
A faint ray of returning reason had enabled him to scan the horrid act, and then, m pity for ever 
took its flight. The thought, that he, of all others, should be the actor — nay, the fiend ! was in 
itself a moral thunderbolt that shivered and smote him with resistless might ; he yielded to the stroke, 
like the storm-rooted flower, lived a short and wretched period, till pitying Providence severed the 
chord that connected the lost spirit to its unnatural teneinent. Oh, Man ! fearfully and wonderfully 
art thou made. To how many servile influences — the slave ! From the cradle to the grave, thy 
history is but a continued series of cares and vexations, the fruits of thine own weakness and in- 
consistency : — then mould thyself to the image of thy God. Possessed of faculties, which if pioperly 
controlled, would establish thee in strength, yet deluded by dogmas, pride, passion, and prejudice, 
you fall the patient victim to thine own misguided imaginings. 



YES! TELL ME OF MY MOTHER! 



Yes ! tell me of my Mother — for my pulse scarce tlirobs the while 

You paint to me her angel look, the starlight of her smile ; 

The softened impress of her soul her very accents took 

Like music of Eolian chords, or tone of bosky brook; 

Her eye that beamed with tenderness, her brow with talent rare, 

Her cheek — but, ah ! the spoiler had placed his signet there. 

I will hush mj heart's proud beating and still my spirit wild, 
'Till listening I seem again to be that happy child 
Who used to cull the flowers of morn in all their freshest bloom, 
Then seek with stealthy step her couch within the darkened room ; 
Who loved to cool her parched skin — her faded lip to press 
That seemed to murmur forth his name, and murmuring to bless. 

Yes ! tell me of my Mother — for the world's tempestuous jar 

Can never sweep from out my breast the mem'ry of the star 

That shed such gentle lustre from hfe's blue and early sky, 

No after rays however bright can with its splendor vie — 

The flaunting light of wayward Love, Ambition's fleeting gleam. 

Or Pleasure's glare grow pale, and fade before its "heaven-lit beam. 

No blissful day-dream }'et hath cheered the loneness of my heart, 
By fond Hope wildly woven, but her image bore its part ; 
And oft when o'er my senses sleep her mantlet soft hath thrown, 
A gentle form bends o'er my couch whose shadowy features own 
A Bister's look, save pale and meek as such you said she bore — 
With morning's light those visions fleet, and I am sad once more. 

Yes! tell me of my Mother — for remembrance of the past 

Can steal some drops of bitterness that in my cup are cast ; 

To me the time gone by is like the fabled silver string 

Of the lyre whose dreamy tone sweet forgetfulness could bring, 

Though its music lindeth me in malady and sorrow 

The present is forgotten, undreaded is the morrow. 

Many a time when Autumn's moon was fading o'er the hill, 

And silence left its mountain horns the slumbering vale to fill, \ 

I've stretched myself along the grave where sweet briars gently waved. 

And in the holy calmness there my troubled spirit laved 

'Till every thought grew pure and bright as infant's sinless brow — 

But few short years have fled since then — where are those pure thoughts riow 1 

Yes ! tell me of my Mother — for amid the careless throng 

Where Pleasure whirls in giddy dance, and weaves her syren song, 

I am not iis I have been where a voice each streamlet lent. 

And echoing from ancestral tombs admonishment was sent, 

To remind me of the innocence my childhood's bosom wore 

And bid me be as innocent 'till that bosom beats no more. 

Then tell me on — I will not tire, for every word doth roll 

Like a cool refreshing wave through the desert of my soul. 

That wakens as it rushes on the soft and soothing strain 

Of feelings that so long unheard and musicless have Iain, 

And bids Affection's fiowrets, that were withered in their bloom, 

To spring again to loveliness, and shed their sweet perfume. E. G. M. 



THE MIAMI VALLEY 



(Comlmiet; IVom page 91.) 



BY A PIONEER OF OHIO, 



CHAPTER IX. 

GinxT and I reposed upon the summit of a rock which capped one of the highest hills in the val- 
ley, and looked upon the far-stretched land below. Girty had lost, in early youth, a mother, whose me- 
mory clung around his heart. He had been treated, like myself, with brutality by his father, but the ' 
mild disposition of his mother invariably soothed the pangs Vi^hich his father occasioned. The good 
aie commonly taken first, and Girty, at an early age, was depri^'ed of his mother, whose spirit he 
often said had taken its abode under the form of a dove;* consequently, he would never injure one 
of those birds. 

While we lay upon the rock, a dove perched upon a tall tree, and iu its peculiar plaintive voice, 
sang its low melancholy song. There is a peculiar effect conveyed with this bird's song, which hap- 
pily concords with our natures when its fire is partly quenched with grief. The bird never sings 
unless depiived of its mate, or of its young, and then there is such a deep pathos mingled with its 
strain, and which appears to me the only combination of sounds that can convey an idea of utter 
loneliness. Girty lay upon his back, looking upon his favorite bird, which ever and anon breathed 
its mournful notes, apparently unconscious of the many discordant screams of the woodpeckers 
around it. For the first time in my life, I saw Girty affected, even to tears — the bold lion was a lamb. 

While Girty indulged in his thoughts, and looked upon his favorite bird, I gazed upon the lovely 
landscape beneath me. The beautiful Miami glided beneath my eye, with its banks lined with trees, 
which threw theii tall shadows in the water, and presented a refuge for the kingfisher, which sat, 
with eagle eyes, watching the fish, that occasionally ruffled its calm surface, as they leaped into 
the air. Sometimes the shrill cry of the kingfisher would reach my ear, and darting into the wa- 
ter, with a wilder scream bear away its prey. The Miami stretched as far as the eye could see, till 
it appeared at the far distance like a golden thread carelessly thrown upon the beautiful map, as the 
declining sun's rays were reflected from its surface. Farther on, the dense wilderness commenced ab- 
ruptly, as if the woodman's axe had cleared an open space for his little farm ; but it was not so, for 
none but ourselves and the aborigines had trod there — no other white man had yet gazed upon the 
beautiful scene — the axe had not marred the beauty of the landscape — nor the rifle driven away the 
deer, which I could see grazing carelessly, unconscious of the proximity of a deadly enemy. This 
side of the wilderness, the brush prairie spread over a great extent, while here and there rose a 
towering oak which had been touched by the lightning, yet still threw up its head, and spread 
out its giant arms tc the blast, as if mocking the storms which for centuries had passed by it harm- 
lessly — but time was silently accomplishing what the rough storms could not ; the bark had de- 
cayed and fallen in long strips to the ground ; the dry and withered limbs were hanging by their 
parent boughs, trembUng with the gentlest gale ; the huge arms, which had sheltered from the storms 
the many animals that dwelt there, were now sapless and withered, and the woodpeckers preyed 
upon the worms which gnawed its heart. The sun was reclining behind a mountain of clouds at the 
iar west, of a thousand airy and fantastic shapes, and of all the evanescent shades of the rainbow — 
from the deep cerulean blue to the mild and lovely carmine — while the objects below appeared to 
partake of the heavenly colors and sparkled with a ruddy glow. Mountain upon mountain of clouds 
appeared piled up, apparently of porphyry, sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. I gazed upon this 
lovely sight in silent rapture. 

Girty remaiiied wrapped in profound thought. The wind now arose, and bore along the brealli 
of the myriads of flowers upon its bosom, and the birds at once ceased singing. I looked up, and 

' Girty had somehow imbibed the Platonic doctrine of transmigration, and imagined that the soul 
of the departed never left this beautiful world, but still lingered here, clothed with the material part 
of some animal, possessing in a great degree the minds, freed from its worst faculties. 



316 BURTOx\'s gentleman's iVIAGAZINE. 

the bright clouds had changed ; a deep blue curtain had apparently fallen over them ; the gold, the 
silver, and the ciimson had faded away, and the sun had departed ; the lovely landscape beneath ap- 
peared wrapped in a gloomy fog — it was night. The whippoorwill and the bat fluttered over our 
heads, and the owl's wild laugh could be heard from the wilderness, like some evil spirit exulting 
over the departuie of day ; the cry of the night-hawk, and the angry howl of the wolves, which had 
now left their lairs, and ware prowling about to glut themselves upon some unfortunate deer. 

The dove which Girty had been listening to, now ceased its mourning, and spreading out its 
wings, sailed for its lonely nest; gradually it receded in the gloom, till its form was almost lost from 
our sight, when it turned, and with a wild scream, again flew towards us. The cause of its pecu- 
liar motions was now solved. With wide spread wings and rapid evolutions, a large night-hawk 
followed close upon it, and with a terrific sc;:eam, darted upon the bird, and bore it shrieking down 
the hill. Girty sprang upon his feet; his face was flushed with excitement; he compressed his lips, 
as was his habit when excited or in danger, and rushed down the steep, with his finger upon the 
trigger of his gun. I followed as rapidly as the darkness would permit, but Girty soon left me be- 
hind, and his heavy tread died away at the distance. I slowly took my way down the hill, guessing 
at the course my companion had taken, and listening for the report of his gun, till it became so dark 
I could scarcely see my hand before me. I sat on a log at the bottom of the hill, and, to pass away 
the time till the moon should rise, washed out my gun in a brook which flowed at my feet. I knew 
Girty was within an easy distance, and every little sound that was borne on the air made me start, 
thinking it was the report of his gun. 

At length, as I had just finished cleaning out my piece, a feint report, which might be more than 
a mile off, reached my ear. I shouldered my gun, and rapidly commenced my march for the direc- 
tion whence the sound proceeded. It was dark, and the hazel bushes were so completely matted, 
that in a short time I got so entangled I could not move without getting my face scratched ; so I re- 
mained where I was till the moon had risen, when I again commenced my laborious journey for the 
wilderness, which rose abruptly from the low hazel bushes, and appeared, by the pale light of the 
moon, like the rocky bank of some large river which I was then in. 

I progressed slowly. As I walked, I whiled away the time by singing to the extent of mj^ voice, 
hoping my friend would hear me and ansvver ; but it was only answered by the wolves with a long 
dismal howl, that ended in broken notes, similar to the barking of a dog. I fired my gun in the air, 
and stood for some time in one spot listening — nought but the same monotonous bark reached my 
ears. I loaded my gun, and continued my march. When within one hundred yards of the woods, 
I observed the dusky forms of apparently hundreds of wolves, which were afraid to venture in the 
moonlight, but kept as much as possible in the shade of the trees, where they kept up a continual 
howl. I was well aware of the savage and bold nature of these animals when half famished, and 
my anxiety increased as I approximated the woods ; for the nearer I advanced the louder the animals 
howled. 

I was now in a dilemma. My pride would not permit me to retreat; still I feared to encounter 
such a number of starving wolves. I stood doubting what to do, and own I felt ashamed to be 
bullied by a gang of cowardly wolves; still I was experienced enough in their natures to know that 
their courage increased in a direct ratio with their hunger. I now observed them jumping, and for 
the first time conjectured the cause of this assemblage. I could indistinctly see in the moonlight a 
deer suspended by a sapling about ten feet from the ground, which some large black wolves were 
making very energetic, yet inefl'ectual, leaps to reach. My plans had to be soon taken, for already 
the wolves saw me, and were venturing out in the light, with their keen eyes glittering like red hot 
coals, and their long teeth shone in the moonlight like ivory. Wolves — and, in fact, nearly all wild 
animals — are afraid of lire. I drew from my pocket a ball of tow, and holding it close to the trigger 
of my gun, fired it off. With one wild howl, which echoed far among the trees, lilie the equally 
wild voices of as many Indian warriors, ihey rushed in the woods, and were hid in the darkness ; 
nothing could be seen of them but their eyes, which appeared as if the woods were alive with coals 
of fire, that twinkled like bright stars of a fair night. The tow caught fire, and I waved it over my 
head till well ignited, and then laying it on the ground, I gathered a few dry sticks, and soon had a 
bright blazing fire, which shed its lustre around, and discovered distinctly the forms of wolves in 
every direction. I could perceive them leaping the high bushes around me, and their rapid breath- 
ing could be distinctly heard from the woods, as they, nearly exhausted, continued their efforts at 
the suspended deer. I siezed a fire-brand, and examined the carcass : it appeared as if it had been 
killed at least twelve hours, and Girty had not been away more than half that time, so I knew that 
Indians had been about, and would be certain to return ; besides Girty could not have shot it, or I 
would have heard the report of his gun. 

I kept up my fire, and shot four wolves ; which lesson kept the rest beyond the light of the fire, but 
occasionally one would venture to the buck, and after one or two leaps, hurry in the dark again. 
About an hour before day, as I was just cocking my gun at a wolf, I heard a cry like an owl ; ano- 
ther succeeded it, like the bark of a mastiff, which was immediately followed by a cry similar to a 
turkey. These imitations were good, and might deceive an inexperienced ear, but they could not 
deceive mine — there was too much of the human voice in the sounds, which, particularly that of 



THE MIAMI VALLEY. 



317 



the turkey, sounded familiar to my ear, and I began to suspect that perhaps my comrade was striving 
to play a trick on mc ; still I took the precaution to retire beyond the light of the fire, for feai I 
might be mistaken. The wolves gathered close around me, and snapped their teeth quite malig- 
nantly, apparently disposed to eat me, despite my exertions to keep them off. I drew out my hat- 
chet, and with it in one hand, and my gun in the other, awaited the confirmation of my suspicions. 
I listened, but could hear nothing ; for the wolves, which formed a ring around me, kept up a con- 
tinual snapping and growling, and occasionally I would have to make a shght noise, in order to 
frighten one away that would have the temerity to venture almost on me. In this disagreeble kind 
of suspense I remained about halt' an hour, when I heard the dry sticks slightly crack, as if some 
one was walking slow and lightly, and also distinguished voices in a whisper. They were directly 
between me and the fire, and were coming towards me ; I stealthily glided aiound the tree as the 
forms of two men passed, treading lightly, and walking very slow. It was so dark that I could not 
see whether they were white men or Indians. They were not niore than ten feet from me, but their 
whispers were so low, I could not hear whether they spoke the Indian langaage or my own. The 
fire was blazing brightly, and near it lay the dead bodies of four wolves, and my own racoon-skin 
cap, which I had forgotten to put on when I left the fire. After a long consultation, which was car- 
ried on in such a low tone as to be inaudible to me, one exclaimed, in a voice little over a whisper — 
" Pete, you go round the fire, keeping out of its light, make some noise, and I will shoot." 
This voice was as familiar to my ears as Girty's ; it was the voice of my friend, John Walker, 
and I knew the other to be Peter Smith — two young hunters, who I knew were out at this time, 
trapping otter. My heart, bounded with joy to see two beings of my own species in this wilderness, 
where I expected to see nothing but wild animals and more dangerous men. " I'll have some sport 
with then\," thought I, as I prepared to arouse the lion within them, by impressing them with the 
belief that they were about having a brush with Indians. This was dangerous sport for me, for these 
men were dead shots with the rifle, which they could use in the dark nearly as well as in the light, 
if the object was only distinguishable ; still I could not resist the temptation of enjoying some sport 
at their expense, as I had undergone some anxiety on their account. Smith was stealthily walking 
around the fire, occasionally making a noise, to arouse some sleeping Indian, while I heard the click 
of Walker's gun, who was now prepared to shoot at the shortest warning. He stood but a few feet 
from me — I raised my gun over his head and fired ; the flash, for a moment, lighted the whole space 
around; the wolves yelled — Walker yelled louder, and Smith ansvi'ered. Before I could more than 
leave iiie spot where I stood. Walker fired ; he had seen me by the flash of the gun, but not with 
sufi^ici#^distinctness to discern me from an Indian — my fortunate move saved me from Walker's

reflected the light from the fiie, shone like silver. Peter Smith was advancing rapidly

in a laugh, and my voice betrayed me. We went to the fire, laughing over the fright 
crgone, and prepared to cook our breakfast. The first red stieaks of morning began to 
e east, and after a few final and desperate attempts to reach the deer, the wolves, as if 
by muluaf agreement, all at once disappeared. I informed my companions of Girty's absence, and 
of the suspended deer — which they had not shot ; therefore, my suspicions about the Indians were 
not at all decreased. 

About daylight, Girty arrived, hungry and exhausted ; he had been fighting wolves all night, and 
consequently had not enjoyed one hour's sleep. He saw the light of our fire, but could not reach 
us sooner; every moment he was forced to turn about and fight off the wolves. For many years 
after these events, this spot was famous for wolves ; but as the population increased, they were driven 
off, or killed, for the sport of hunting them.

"Tis dark December now. The early eves 

Are starless, long, and cold ; — the rain-winds

The robin perches most on household eaves, 

Craving the crumbs he sings for from the

The slim deer shelter from the bitter wind 
Behind broad trees, couching on withered leaves.

A RESUSCITATED JOE.* 



There ceitainly is no more dangerous thing 

Than vanity ; 

As you shall see, 

If you'll but read the history 
Of him, who of flute players was styled the king. 
He played night at'lei night at Druiy lane, 
And his reception made him very vain. 
He'd been encoied so oft — they clapped so loud, 
He fairly lost his wits, and grew exceeding proud. 

It chanced, one night, in shifting of the scene, 

A peg. 
Which was not fastened as it should have been. 

Slipped out of place. 
And down the scene came thundering on the stage. 
Slap on the tooling wonder of the age, 

And broke his leg. 
Slowly oui hero from the stage was led. 
And, groaning sadly, taken home to bed. 

Months passed away, 

And there he lay ; 
A thousand busy rumors circulate 
About the poor, unhappy flutist's fate. 

Some said 

That he v.^as dead. 

And actually buried ; 
Whilst others, with a knowing kind of leer, 

Checked every body's consternation 

With the important infoimation. 
That, prior to the closing of the year, 
Once more before the public Fluty would appear. 

At last, 
Thanks to the doctor's healing art, 

The crisis past. 
He got right well and able to resume his pait. 

It was upon the very night 
On which king George the Third was there ; 

And, as was right. 



Flocked thither all the noble, lich and gay and fair. 

'Twas quite the thing ; 
And, as is usual upon such occasion, 
To gratify a loyal happy nation, 

Some how, 
Just as our flutist made his first low bow, 

The orchestra struck up " God save the king." 
All hats were off" — claps sounded loud and long, 
And all united in the loyal song. 
With swelling heart, he bowed still lower down; 
He felt as ought to feel the favorite of the town. 

This cordial salutation — 
This loud and deafening applause. 
Without a pause — 

This anthem of the nation. 
Conveying such a delicate compliment. 
For him, the king of music, only could be meanf.

A gentleman, who in the stage-box sat, 

Observing Fluty's sad conceit, 
And deeming the occasion pat 
For harmless fun. 
Hinted the joke to one on the next 
His neighbor whispered to a third, 
He to a fourth — a fifth. Soon, round the word 
Through all the theatre like wild fire ran, 

Till not a man. 
Woman, or child, in boxes, pit, or gallery, 
But was quite eager to enjoy the raillery. 
" Once more God save the king," they shout with 
zeal- 
There stood the wonder of the agC' — 
The wonder of the age there stood — 
Tears in his eyes, brimful of gratitude — 
Bowitig and blowing kisses to the pit. 
When, quite unable thus to stomach it, 
Amidst a shower of orange peel. 
The audience, hissing, drove him from the stage.

FIRE-SIDE SO 



E T 



For very want of thought and occupation, 
Upon my fire, as broad and high it blazed, 
In idle and unweeting mood I gazed, 
And in that mass of bright and glowing things 
Fancy, which in such moments readiest springs. 
Soon found materials for imagination : 
Within the fiie, all listless as I mazed, 
Tbeie saw I trees and towers and hilk and plains, 



Faces with warm smiles glowing, flocks and 
swains. 
And antic shapes of laughable creation. 
And thus the poet's soul of fire contains 

A store of all things bright and glorious, raised 
By fancy, that daft artizan, to shape 
Into fair scenes and forms that nature best may 
ape. W. T. M 



HE SCOTCHMAN AND THE TWA S A R K S. 

A TRUE STORY. 



SosiE four or five years ago, T met a friend who told rae that a shoemaker in Rose street, whom 
he employed, talked a great deal about me, and that if I would call on him he was sure he would 
take it particularly kind. I therefore called and found an oldish dark-faced little man sitting cutting 
leather with specs on. 

" Well," says I, " friend, you want me it seems, my name is Mitchell." 

" Aye," says he, " sir, I have long wanted to see you, but I never liked to call — ye'U no mind me 
sir, or I'm cheated." 

" No," says I, " I really do not." 

" Geordie Manners is my name," says he, " I was in the company you commanded in the Scotch 
biigade, and if there is a man on earth I owe gratitude to, it is you. Yes, sir, ye saved my life^t 
ae time, and then prevented me from being flogged at another ; besides mony other kindnesses, and 
I am unco prood you have been so good as call. Do you no mind me noo, sir, that ye have had 
time to look at me !" 

" Indeed no," says I, " Geordie, I do not recollect you ; for I don't remember having such an ugly 
looking body in my company." 

" Oh, sir," says he, " that's so like your old way ; but remember it is thirty-five years since you 
wsa me, and make allowance for age and change of dress." 

I then look another keen survey of his black fiz, and said, " Now 1 think I do recollect at least 
something of your features; but tell me," says I, " for I forget all about you, how I was of so much 
service to you." 

"Well, sir," says he, "I will begin at the beginning of my story. I was a raw rattling inexperienced 
lad, about nineteen years of age, when I enlisted. I had been brought up a shoemaker, and in a 
frolic took the king's money, and became a soldier ; but I had a sweetheart, and I could not leave 
her, and '(therefore wc got married. AAvay we went as happy as crickets, and landed with the re&lt;n- 
ment al Hilsay barracks, where we were unmercifully drilled for three months, and then embarked 
on board of transports at Portsmouth, to go naebody kent whare. Well, sir, we lay at St. Helen's 
for at least seven weeks. One day we were going to the West Indies — another day we were going 
to Leel Du, (L'Isle de Dieu,) — another we were going to the coast of France, and so on. A' ye- 
no mind, sir," says he, " how we were dumfoundered wi' contrary stories ?" 

" Quite well," says I, " Geordie, go on." 

•' Well, at last," says Geordie, " an order came to send ashore all the supernumerary wives over 
and above ten to a company, and that the ten per company were to be fixed upon by drawin'' lots. 
Oh, sir, that was the most awful moment of my life. The thoughts of parting with my dear bonny 
Christy was death to me ; but no time was to be lost — the ten longest cuts in each company of one 
hundred men and perhaps eighteen wives, were to decide our fate, and many an anxious wae-like 
face there were amongst us. At last ye came round yourself with cuts, and after three or four had 
drawn, you called me up. ' Come along, Manners, and try your luck,' says you. Weel, sir, the 
light forsook my eyes. I pooed a cut, and jumped right up, not knowing what I was doing; and 
oh ! sir, it was a lang gin. Weel, I thought I would have gone raving mad with pj. I grat wi' 
pleasure ; and poor Christy was crazed and, deed sir, I thought you was happy tu. An awful scene 
followed, sir ; the strait cuts were all obliged to leave the ship, and mony a sair heart andwat cheek 
was to be seen ; but I was as happy as a king, and far happier, faith. Well, sir, we continued in 
hourly expectations of being ordered to trip our anchors for three days, and when the fourth ar- 
rived, and we were beginning to think we would remain at least another week, a bum-boat came along- 
side that our mess dealt with, and my bonny Christy having a great wish to go ashore for some bite 
of tape, and things o' that sort, I consented in a rash moment to let her go ; but oh, sir ! months and 
years of vexation did that consent give me ; the boat was not away an hour, when smack went a 
gun from Admiral Christian's ship, and up went the blue peter ! The boatswain's whistle went to 
njy heart. ' All hands up to trip anchor.' Oh, sir, it rings in my auld heart yet. There was a 
kind of gleamor cam ower my een. I got quite stupid. I knew not what passed. A heavy rain 
cam on. I was at last roused up by one of our company. I was wet to the skin. I looked towards 
Portsmouth, I could hardly see it — our transport sailed fast. At last the Isle of Wight was out of 
eight, and my misery was at its height. Weel, sir, to dwell on my situation would be nonsense ; 
yoo can guess, but I can't tell it ; at one time I thought of jumping overboard — at another I thought 
she might perhaps be in some of the ships that left St. Helen's the last : but altogether my mind was

any thing but composed. At last I unbuckled my knapsack, and found in it Christy's tvva sarks 
and her bit housewif for keeping her needles and preens. Oh, sir, how the blood ran cauld through 
every vein of my body. I kissed them ten thousand times, and huggit them to my heait. I really 
thought, sir, there was a something of Christy's heart aboot them — they composed my brain, and I 
determined they should never be out of my possession. My knapsack was my pillow, but before 
laying my head down every night, I slid my hand in, and took all that Christy left, and wept over ihem 
and pressed them to my bosom. Ye'el mind the storm we had in the Bay of Biscay, sir," says Geordie. 

" Oh, yes," says I. 

"I'll never forget that sight," says Geordie ; " there was about nine hundred sail of us, and the 
sight was awful. I'll never see such another in this world. The waves were as big as Arthur's 
seat ; and when we were doon in the hollow, and looking up we saw mair than half of the ship's 
bottom that was on the top of the wave before us ; and sometimes when our ship was on the top, I 
looked down as if from a precipice, and thinking on poor Christy, I wished from my heart we might 
all go to the liottom ; — however , hard as my lot was, I was obliged to bear up. We landed at 
Gibraltar, where we did duty for nine months, and then we went to the Cape for three years, during 
all which time I never heaid a word of poor Christy. At last we weie ordered on to Madras, which 
pleased all my comrades ; but with regard to myself, I was quite indifferent. Oh, sir, how many 
hundred times have I stole my hand into my knapsack and pooed out some of Christy's trifles, and 
in the dead of the night, when no human eye witnessed it, how often have I retired behind a gun 
when on guard in Gibraltar, and kissed and weeped over them ! — and in the tall wild heather at the 
Cape, how often have I done the same ; and in the burning sands of India, how often have I stolen 
out from our tents in the night time, and kissed the only relic of my only love ! Ah weel, sir, after 
serving in India for nine years, my health got indifferent ; and I, with other twenty-five, were ordered 
home to be discharged. Off we came, and in eight months we were landed and marched into 
barracks at Chatham, where we remained for nearly three months ; but at last an order came for us 
to march to Chelsea, to be inspected. Ah weel, sir, just the night before we marched — and a nasty, 
cold, rainy night it was — one of my comrades came running into the barrack room : ' Manners/ 
Bays he, ' there's a woman wanting you.' ' A woman!' cried I, and in a momeiit Christy was in 
jny aims. Well, sir, I was perfectly delighted and confounded, for I had never heard of her ; — but 
she had heard, for a' that, of me ; and when she learned I n'as at Chatham, she did not stay for mair 
news, but off she came. After the first astonishment was over — ' Geordie,' says she, ' I am wet to 
the skin, and I must go back about a quarter of a mile for a bundle I left at the public house there, 
for I was not very fond of the road in the dark.' ' If it's for a dry sark,' says I, ' Christy, wait till 
the morning; fori have twa of yours that have never been out of rny company for thirteen years' — 
I displayed them — we both stared at one another, and my comrades showed their kindly feelings 
towards us by heavy sighs and sobs, and hearty hands-shaking." 

I was much pleased with honest Geordie's story ; "but," says I, "tell me how I saved your life, Geordie." 

" Oh, sir, I can soon satisfy you on that score. At the battle of Malavilj)' we had a desperate long 
hot march before the battle began — we discovered the enemy all of a sudden, posted on heights that 
commanded the village, the road, and the ground we were going to occupy, and on v^-e maiched in 
line to attack them — I am certain we marched three miles in line ; and what with the heat of the 
sun and the distance we had marched, I, with my mouth parched with biting the cartridge, was just 
going to fall down, when you saw me, and running up, you look ray firelock out of my hand, and 
propped me up, and taking your canteen from your back, you gave me a hearty swig of brandy and 
water, and I was myself again in a few minutes — had I fallen down, sir, I would have been cut to 
pieces in a few minutes; for just as I got better, a column of their cavaliy charged our regiment, 
and although none of them got through, there were about half-a-dozen got into our rear by passing 
between the flank of the grenadiers and the guns, and one of these cut little Scotty to pieces. He 
had charge of the doctor's instruments, and was killed just on the spot where you helped me from 
faUing down five minutes before — do you mind ony thing aboot that, sir 1" says Geordie. 

"Indeed, no," says I. 

" Ah, but I will never forget it," saj s he. 

" Well, as to the saving you from a flogging, Geordie," says I, " tell me about that." 

" Well, sir, it was at Seringapatam, I think, about a fortnight after we took it, we were paid our 
clearance money, and the whole regiment was drunk for three days. The first and second day little 
was said about it ; but when the third day came we were paraded, and a few faults looked over ; but 
when the fourth day came, every thing was expected to be right. Your company's roll was called 
and all present but me ; in a little I made my appearance, mortal drunk, and wrapped up in a white 
sheet. ' Corporal Ogg,' says lieutenant Buchan, ' take filanners to the guard.' Well, sir, the word 
was hardly out of his mouth, when you came on parade yourself, and taking Buchan to one side a 
little, you whispered to Ogg to take me to my barrack room. ' He'll no stay, sir,' says Ogg; 'he'll 
be cot again when my back's turned.' 'Reid,' says you to Corporal Reid, ' go up with Ogg, and 
help him to tie Manners to his bed.' I was tied, sir, to my bed for ten hours, and then I was re- 
leased, and have ever since been most grateful to you, for had I been confined and flogged, it would 
have done no good, for, to the best of my recollection, I never was drunk again in my life." 



THE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION. 



BT EDGAR A. P0£. 



EiRos. Why do you call me Eiros 1 

Chabmion. So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget, too, my earthly name, 
and speaJi to me as Charmion. 

EiROs. This is indeed no dream ! 

Charmion. Dreams are with us no more — but of these m3rsteries anon. I rejoice to see you 
looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has already passed from ofi your eyes. Be 
of heart, and fear nothing. Your allotted days of stupor have expired ; and, to-morrow, I will my- 
self induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence. 

EiRos. True — I feel no stupor — none at all. The wild sickness and the terrible darkness have 
left me, and I hear no longer that mad, rushing, horrible sound, like the " voice of many waters." 
Yet my senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception of the new. 

Charmion. A few days will remove all this — but I fully understand you, and feel for vou. It 
is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you undergo — yet the remembrance of it hangs by 
me still. You have now suffered all of pain, however, which you v/ill suffer in Aidenn. 

EiRos. In Aidenn 1 

Charmion. In Aidenn. 

EiRos. Oh God ! — pity me, Charmion ! — I am overburthened with the majesty of all things — 
of the unknown now known — of the speculative Future meiged in the august and certain Present. 

Charmion. Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this. Your 
mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memories. Look not around, 
nor forward — but back. I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event 
which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar things, in the old familiar 
language of the world which has so fearfully perished. 

Eiros. Most fearfully, fearfully ! — this is indeed no dieam. 

Charmion. Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Ehosi 

Eiros. Mourned, Charmion'? — oh deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a cloud of intense 
gloom and devout sorrow over your household. 

Charmion. And that last hour — speak of it. Eemember that, beyond the naked fact of the 
catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among mankind, I passed into Night 
through the Grave — at that period, if I remember aiight, the calamity which overwhelmed you was 
utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day. 

Eiros. The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated ; but analogous mis- 
fortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, 
that, even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings 
which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth 
alone. But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that 
epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame. The 
very moderate density of these bodies had been well established. They had been observed to pass 
among the satellites of Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses 
or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had long regarded the wanderers as vapoiy creations 
of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injurj' to our substantial globe, even in 
the event of contact. But contact was not in any degree dreaded ; for the elements of all the comets 
were accurately known. That among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery 
destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies 
had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind ; and, although it was only with a few of the 
ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed upon the announcement by astronomers of a neiu comet, 
yet this announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust. 

The elements of the strange oib were immediately calculated, and it was at once conceded by all 
observers that its path, at perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There 
were two or three astronomers, and these of secondary note, who resolutely maintained that a contact 
was inevitable. I cannot veiy well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people. 
For a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed 



322 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a vitally important 
fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that 
astronomical knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was not, at first, seem- 
ingly rapid — nor was its appearance of very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little 
perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, an d 
but a partial alteration in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all 
interests absorbed in a growing discussion, instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary 
nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The 
learned now gave their intellect — their sou! — to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the sus- 
tenance of loved theory. They sought — they panted for right views. They groaned for perfected 
knowledge. Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed 
down and adored. 

That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact, 
was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise — and the wise were now freely permitted 
to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated, that the density of the comet's 
nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas ; and its harmless passage among the satellites of 
Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and one which served gieatly to allay terror. Theologists, 
with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the 
people with a directness and simplicit3^ of which no previous instance had been known. That the 
linal destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit 
that enforced every where conviction ; and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now 
knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity 
foretold. It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and 
wars — errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet — were now altogether 
unknown. As if by some sudden convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled superstition from 
her throne. The feeblest understanding had derived vigor from excessive interest. 

What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question. The learned 
spoke of slight geological disturbances ; of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vege- 
tation; of possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible effect 
■would in any manner be produced. While such discussions were going on, their subject gradually ap- 
proached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilhant lustre. Mankind grew paler 
as it came. All human operations were suspended. 

There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained at length 
&amp; size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation. The people, now, dismissing any linger- 
ing hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. The chimerical 
aspect of their terror was gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their 
bosoms. A very few days sufficed, however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unen- 
durable. We could no longer apply to the strange oib any accustomed thoughts. Its historical 
attributes had disappeared. It Oppressed us with a hideous ttotelty of emotion. We saw it not as an 
astronomical phenomenon in the heavens — but as an incubus upon our heart, and a shadow upon 
t lu brain. It had taken, with inconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame 
extending from horizon to horizon. 

Yet a day. and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we were already within the 
influence of the comet — yet we lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of 
njind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent ; all heavenly objects were 
plainly visible through it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered — and we gained faith, 
from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage— utterly 
unknown before — burst out upon every vegetable thing. 

Yet another day — and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now evident that its nucleus 
would first reach us. A wild change had come over all men — and the first sense of pain was the 
wild signal for general lamentation and horror. This first sense of pain lay in a rigorous constric- 
tion of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that 
our atmosphere vv^as radically affected — the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modi- 
fications to which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of investi- 
gation sent an electric thrill of the intensest lerror through the universal heart of man. 

It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen 
gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in every one 
hundred of the atmosphere. O'xygen, whicli was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, 
was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic 
sigent in nature. Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life oi flame. 
An unnatural excess of oxygen vvould result, it had been ascertained; in just such an elevation of the 
animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which 
had engendered awe. What would be the result of g Mai extraction of the nitrogen ? A combus- 
■ lien irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate — the entire fulfilment, in all its minute and 
terrible details, of the fiejy and hoi'ror-inepiring deirjiaTiciatJOBs of the prophecies of the Holy Book. 



THE OLD LOVE. 



323 



Why need I paint, Clxarmion, the now disenchaineJ frenz)^ of mankind ? That tenuity in the 
comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. 
In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a 
day again passed — bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid modifi- 
cation of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious de- 
lirium possessed all men ; and, with arms immoveably outstretched towards the threatening Heavens, 
they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us. Even here 
in Aidenn, I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief — brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a 
short moment there was a wild luiid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then — let us 
bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God I — then, there came a great per- 
vading sound, as if from the mouth itself of him ; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which 
we existed burst at once into a species of intense fiamefor whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid 
heat even the angels in the great Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all. 



THE OLD L O Y 



BY C a K E I. I t" S 



'Tis twenty winters since we met, 

And still I dream of thee ; 
Though waking I awhile forg.et 

Sleep brings thee back to me ! — 
I see thee in thy beauty's prime, 

And not as thou art now — 
Eie one long line of lengthening lime 

Was traced upon thy brow. 

I see the summer of thy smile. 

The sunshine of thine eyes. 
And feel I am not old the while, 

And know no miseries !-^. 
The vision flies — thy smile is gone 

I wake again to care. 
And loathe the day, whose sunny dawn 

More darkens my despair ! 

If to mine eyes my feelings rush, 

And tears — unmanly tears — 
Again from this haid Horeb gush. 

The treasured grief of year?^ 
'Tis thou that bidd'st these waters Sow ; 

And if my tears condemn 
My manhood with this woman's woe, 

'Tis thou should'st blush for them I 

But no — I will not think of blame — 

I love thee still too well; — 
Be witness this poor wasting frame 

From fires unquenchable — 
The thought of thee when wandering where 

My happy hours were pass'd — 
The long, long groan when lingering there 

Where I beheld thee last ! 



Ah, Mary ! these are things which make 

My. heart and spirit feel 
What: I have suffer 'd for thy sake, 

But for thy, sake conceal !- — 
Oh may no agonies like mine, 

That make the heart their prey — 
Ko grief that makes the spirit pine. 

Wear thy dear life away ! 

My name is pei'haps forgotten now. 

And all I was to thee ; 
But thine is written on my brow 

Deeply — indelibly ! 
The world may read no record there, 

And faithful friends, who think 
They know my heart — its sorrows share, 

Behold not that I sink. 

Yet I am sinking — to the grave — 

Lone place, but one of rest ; 
Where, when the yew and cypress wave 

Above my silent breast, 
And gray light lingeis in the gloom. 

And solemn shadows flit 
Like mourning friends about my tomb, 

And evening hallows it- 
There if, some time, with pilgrim feet 

Thou piously should'st stray. 
To dress my verdant winding-sheet, 

And keep the weeds away. 
My spirit, hovering overhead. 

Shall breathe about thee peace. 
And bless thy homage to the dead. 

And bid thv sorrow cease !

down to the score of wide balls, and such balls shall not be reckoned as any of the four balls. 

13. If the bowler bowl a " no hall," the striker may play at it, and be allowed all the runs he can 
get; and shall not be put out, except by running out. In the event of no run being obtained by 
any other means, then one run shall be scored.

24. Or, if the striker touch, or take up the ball while in play, unless at the request of the other 
party. 

25. Or, if, with any part of his person, he stop the ball, which, in the opinion of the umpire at 
the bowler's wicket, shall have been delivered in a straight line to the striker's wicket, and would 
have hit it. 

26. If the players have crossed each other, he that runs for the wicket which is put down is out. 

27. When a ball shal,l be caught, no run shall be reckoned. 

28. When a striker shall be run out, the run which they were attempting shall not be reckoned. 

29. If a lost ball shall be called, the striker shall be allowed six runs ; but, if more than six shall 
have been run before lost ball shall have been called, then the striker shall have all which have been 
run. 

30. When the ball has been in the bowler's or wicket-keeper's hands, it is considered as no longer 
in play : and the strikers need not keep within their ground till the uaipire has called "^/ay,-" but, 
if the player go out of his ground with an intent to run before the ball be delivered, the bowler may 
put him out. 

31. If the striker be hurt, he may retire from his wicket, and return to it at any time in that in- 
nings. 

32. If a striker be hurt, some other person may be allowed to stand out for him, but not to go in. 

33. No substitute in the field shall be allowed to bowl, keep wicket, stand at the point, or middle

from cannot see sufficiently to decide upon, he may apply to the other umpire, whose opinion is con- 
clusive. 

38. The umpires in all matches shall pitch fair ■wickets, and the parties shall toss for the choice 
of innings. 

39. They shall allow two minutes for each man to come in, and fifteen minutes between each in- 
nings. When the umpires shall call '■'■'play" the party refusing to play shall lose the match. 

40. They are not to older a player out, unless appealed to by the adversaries.

43. No umpire shall be allowed to bet. 

44. The umpires are not to be changed during the match, but by the consent of both parties. 

45. After the delivery of four balls, the umpire must call " over," but not until the ball shall be 
finally settled in the wicket keeper's or bowler's hand ; the ball shall then be considered dead ; never- 
theless, if an idea be entertained that a striker is out, a question may be put previously to, but not 
after the delivery of, the next ball. 

46. The umpire must take especial care to call " no ball," instantly upon delivery ; — " wide ball,"" 
as soon as ever it shall pass the striker. 

47. The players who go in second shall follow their innings, if they shall have obtained one hun-

1. When there shall be less than five players on a side, bounds shall be placed twenty-two yards 
each in a line from the off and leg stump. 

2. The ball must be hit before the bounds to entitle the striker to a run; which run cannot be

obtained, unless he touch the bowling stump or crease in a line with it with his bat, or some part of 
his person ; or go beyond them ; returning to the popping crease, as at double wicket, according to 
the twenty-second law. 

3. When the striker shall hit the ball, one of his feet must be on the ground, and behind the pop- 
pJBg ciease, otherwise the umpire shall call " no hit." 

4. When there shall be less than five players on a side, neither byes nor overthrows shall be al- 
lowed ; nor shall the striker be caught out behind the wicket, nor stumped out. 

5. The field's man must return the ball so that it shall cross the play between the wicket and the 
bowling stump, or between the bowling stump and the bounds ; the striker may run till the ball shall 
so be returned. 

6. After the striker shall have made one run, if he start again, he must touch the bowling stump, 
and turn before the ball shall cross the play, to entitle him to another. 

7. The striker shall be entitled to three runs for lost ball, and the same number for ball stopped 
with hat; with lefeience to the twenty-ninth and thirty-fourth laws of double wicket. 

8. When there shall be more than four players on a side, there shall be no bounds. All hits, byes, 
and overthrows, shall then be allowed. 

9. The bowler is subject to the same laws as at double wicket. 
10. Not more than one minute shall be allowed between each ball. 



BETS. 

No bet upon any match is payable unless it be played out or given up. 

If the runs of one player be laid against those of another, the bets depend on the first innings, 
tinless otherwise specified. 

If the bets be made upon both innings, and one party beat the other in one innings, the runs in 
the first innings shall determine the bet. 

But if the other party go in a second time, then the bet must be determined by the number on 
the score. 



TO A PORTRAIT OF A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. 



T 31ALC0M GnAEME, lAKCASTEH, PA, 



The light brown tresses gracefully 

Hang round thy beauteous face, 
And lichly on thy white neck lie, 

That curves in youthful grace ; 
And like the Parian marble white, 

Thy pure and youthful brow — 
Thy soft blue eyes a tender light 

Throw gently on me now. 

Oh ! such as haunts the poet's sleep. 

Thy face so young and fair ; 
Thy lose-cheek shadowed soft and deep 

By thy rich sunny hair. 
Oh ! such the painter in his dreams 

At twilight hour might see, 
By Andalusia's peaceful streams, 

In vine-hung Italv. 



I gaze upon thy beauteous form, 

And round about me rise 
A crowd in memory's sunshine warm — 

Young brows and gentle eyes. 
A glowing vision comes with thee — 

A scene of other days — 
Of those who trod life's path with me, 

And fragments of old lays. 

And bursting through the clouds of care, 

Streams brightly on my heart. 
The suirshine of rich feeling where 

Those shadowy clouds depart ; 
And 'mid the cares of after life, 

Oft shall come back to me, 
In days of toil and feverish strife, 

Sweet joyous thoughts of thee. 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS 



The Museum of Religious KnovAedge, designed to illustrate Religious Truth. Edited by Marcus 
E. Cross. One Volume, pp. 264:. J. Whetham, Philadelphia. 

A valuable and judicious embodiment of various papers connected writh the exposition of the ne- 
cessity of religious truth. There is no sectarian violence in the matters broached ; and we earnestly 
recommend the essays on " Mental and Moral Culture" and " The Moral Influence of popular De- 
scriptions of Battle Scenes" to the attention of the reader. This unpretending volume may be ad- 
vantageously placed in the hands of youth. One of Sartain's brilliant mezzotints ornaments the 
work; it represents Robert Morrison and his Chinese Assistants engaged in the translation of the 
Bible into the language of the heavenly Empire. This plate is a beautiful specimen of art, from a 
painting by G. Chinnery. 



The Christian Keepsalce and Missio7iary Annual for 1840. Edited by the Rev. John A. Clark. 
W. Marshall, and, Co. Philaddphia. 

We hare purposely delayed noticing this splendid Annual until the advent of the season of Sou- 
venirs and Gifts, trusting that our recommendation, honestly set forth, will induce a demand for the 
Christian Keepsake among the remembrance-seekers of Christmas and New Year's tide. The 
present volume is in the same excellent keeping that won deserved praise in our notices of the Keep- 
sake for 1838 and 1839 ; the editor copies a portion of a letter from the Reverend Dr. Dick of Scot- 
land, referring to the tendency of the work to " promote the cause of pure and undefiled religion, 
inasmuch as nothing of a sectarian spirit pervades any of the papers, so that they may be perused 
with interest by persons of all religious denominations. As to their exterior," continues the Reverend 
Dr. Dick, " they are the most elegant volumes I have seen from your side of the Atlantic ; they 
reflect honor both on the paper maker, the printer, the book-binder, and the engraver, and will bear a 
comparison, in these respects, with mosi of the Annuals published in London." 

We freely indorse the Reverend's opinion, albeit we dislike his unnecessary and awkward use 
of the copulative conjunction. The engravings in the present volume are superior in value to the 
illustiations of the preceding years. The frontispiece is a speaking likeness of the Reverend Richard 
Channing Moore, the illustrious Episcopalian Bishop of Virginia, after H. Inman's celebrated 
painting. "The Burning Prairie" is an exciting scene, painted by one of the best American artists, 
Russel Smith, whose genius requires nothing but maturity to enable him to cope with the proudest 
sons of the easel. This subject, and another by the same artist, " A Scene on the Ohio," have been 
well treated by the engravers, Smilley and Cushman. Dodson has three superior plates — the frontis- 
piece, " The Nun," after Thompson, and " Innocence," after De Franca. We have no fault to find 
with Armstrong for his engraving of Washington — it is a creditable version of an inferior picture, 
and we regret that the publishers deemed it worthy of notice. The subject is of difficult nature, 
we admit, but there is a woful lack of skill in Kyle's method of arrangement. General Washington 
is said, while encamped at Valley Forge, to have frequently retired into the depths of a secluded 
grove for the purpose of prayer. The painter has placed the illustrious hero upon his knees, it is 
true, but there is a self-satisfied air about his figure, and a smirk upon his countenance, which sadly 
harmonize with the act of supplication to the God of Battles, 

The literary contents of this year's Christian Keepsake fully sustain the former reputation of the 
work. The editor has furnished the best prose article in the book, and we gladly point to our own 
esteemed contributors, Charles West Thomson, Miss Waterman, Professor Wines, Mrs. EUet, Dr. 
Mitchell, and Mrs. Sigourney, as conspicuous names in the list of writers. 

In the lengthful catalogue of " Contributors," placed at the commencement of the volume, there 
are upwards of thirty names given whose articles do not appear in the body of the work. We know 
not who is to blame, but the act is at least a reprehensible instance of neglect. The persons enu- 
merated may have promised contributions, and the editor may have printed their names in the 
belief that the various parties would fulfil their obligations. We are unwilling to allow the inten-

tion of deceit, but we are satisfied that such a statement is positively injurious to the work ; for while 
several of the announced names exhibit the well-known appellations of certain wordy poetasters and 
plagiarists, others are affixed to persons of worth and mark. The reader will readily excuse the 
absence of the pretty verses of vaiious of the Honorables and the Reveiends, of the Clarks, and the 
Jameses, and the Browns, but it is hard to be promised articles from such writers as James Montgo- 
mery, Mrs. Opie, the Rev. Thomas Raffles, George W. Bethune, and Professor Cleveland, and yet 
fail to find them in the pages of the work. 

One of the most impudent specimens of plagiarism that ever occurred, disgraces the pages of this 
Annual, and deserves exposure and castigation, inasmuch as it is an insult to the common sense of 
the leading community, and a positive wrong to the publishers, who have liberally expended the 
necessary sums in the procuration of superior literary worth. At page 305, there is " A Christmas 
Carol," by Richard W. Dodson, Esq. of Philadelphia. Now, this Christmas Carol is copied in 
substance and spirit from a Hymn for Christmas by Mrs. Hemans, We give the first verse of each 
article, and leave Mr. Dodson to speak for himself. 



MRS. HEMANS.

Bid our doubts and fears to cease, 
Ye that cheer'd the Syrian swains, 

Cheer us with that song of peace. 



The Poet : a Metrical Romance of the Seventeenth Century. 

phia, Carey and Hart. 



A Keepsake for 1840. Philadel- 



This well printed volume is one of the curiosities of literature. It is the product of the leisure of 
W. J. Walter, Esq. a gentleman now residing in Philadelphia, devotedly attached to the good old 
school of English Poetry, and known to the lovers of the belles lettres as the editor of the splendid 
London editions of Southwell and Herrick. 

" The Poet" is a combination of the beauties of the poets of the seventeenth century, placed, not 
" like orient pearls at random strung," but in relative order and connected bearing, to illustrate the 
origin, progress, and completion of an amatory siege. It is impossible to convey an idea of the ex- 
cellent finish given to this simple but effective matter by the pure taste and genuine poetic feeling 
of the compiler; the poet, "in imagination all compact," must hasten to secure this cyclopedia of 
Cupid's love, dehvered in the choice language of the quaint old masters who drank from the pure 
well of English undefiled. The lover must not neglect possessing this vade-mecum, wherein he can 
trace the passage of his own disease, and read, in choice and fancied epithets, the manner of his 
own pursuit. 

We beg leave especially to recommend " The Poet" as a Gift book most likely to be acceptable to 
the ladies. The delicacy of the conceit, and the variety of the gems embodied in the carrying-out of 
that conceit, must render this little volume peculiarly delightful to all sensitive minds. It is indis- 
putably the best collection of rare and approved selections from the ancient poets ever given to the 
world. 

The volume is dedicated by Mr. Walter to Nicholas Biddle. We congratulate the gentlemen on 
their acquaintance with each other. 



Albert de Eosann ,- or The Adventures of a French Gentleman. By G. M. W. Reynolds. Two 
Volumes. Carey and Hart, Philadelphia. 

This is decidedly the best reprint of the year. If Paul de Kock's name had appeared in the title 
page as the author, the work would have received a larger share of popularity, but we doubt if Paul 
de Kock, fond of him as we are, ever penned a better novel or tale of life than this same Albert de 
Rosann. Mr. Reynolds is the son of the old dramatist, who is notorious in histrionic record for the 
number of bad comedies which he has inflicted upon the suffering public, and for the quantities of 
monies that he obtained in payment for his trash. The young man is the author of a work on 
French literature, which has been severely handled by the English critics ; he is also the author of 
"Pickwick Abroad," a continuation of Boz's unequalled papers — but the dry humor of Samivel Weller

killed Mr, Reynolds, and the French travels of ihePickwickians have never been considered orthodox. 
We believe also that Mr. Reynolds is the anonymous author of the celebrated novel of "Miserrimus!" a 
■work of talent and worth. The book befoie us stamps him a writer of wonderful excellence; there 
is an originality in its plot, and a vividity in the details, that attract the attention of the reader, and 
hold him a willing prisoner to the close of the volumes. The style is leraarkably free and Parisian, 
particularly adapted to the development of the Adventures of a French gentleman and his companion, 
a chevalier cTindustrie of the first class. 



Memoirs of His Own Time ; Including the Revolution, The Empire, and The Restoration. By 
Lieut. Gen. Count Mathieu Dumas. Two Volumes. Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia. 

Count Mathieu Dumas will be remembered by all Americans as one of the aid-de camps of General! 
Rochambeau, during his command of the corps of twelve thousand men sent by the French Govern- 
ment to our assistance, in the year 1780. The' Count shared this appointment with the Chevalier 
de Lameth, Count Charles de Damas, the Count de Vauban, the Count de Fersen, the Count de 
Lauberbiere, and M. Collet. , 

The life of Dumas has been long, and exceedingly fruitful of events. He was bom in 1753, and 
these Memoirs extend from the year 1773, when he first entered the service of France, to the end of 
the year 1826, an extensive period rife with momentous occurrences, in many of which he bore an 
important, if not at all times a- conspicuous part. In 1826, he had considered his political career 
terminated, and thought only of enjoying, in retirement, the society of his family and friends ; but 
he was unexpectedly thrust back upon public life, wherein he played a busy role for the ten sub- 
sequent years — until 1836. Upon these latter years the posthumous journal now published does not 
touch ; although his various positions, during the period, must have imbued his entire spirit with 
intrigue. We now find him first, a member of the Chamber of Deputies ; then principal co-operator 
with the illustrious La Fayette in the re-organization of the National Guards ; then Counsellor of 
State, and lastly a Member of the Chamber of Peers. It is remarkable that from the year 1827, he 
had been totally blind ; and was prevented, in consequence, from prosecuting the historical under- 
takings which have been announced, as in progress, and for which he had collected a world of 
valuable material. These Memoirs are the result of dictation to an amanuensis. They are, of course, 
very interesting, and should have a place in every historical library. 



The Most Important Parts of BlacJcstone's Commentaries, Reduced to Questions and A7isivers, 
By Asa Kinjie. Second Edition. W. S. Bean, New Yoi-k. 

This work was originally prepared by Mr. Kinne (who is a citizen of Natchez) without any view 
to publication. His primary design was to impress more vividly upon his own mind the spirit and 
leading facts of Blackstone, than can be done by the ordinary system of perusal, even when careful 
attention is given to the text, and the whole matter thoroughly noted, or common-placed. There 
are few men of logical thought who have not, at some period of life, experienced the benefit of re- 
ducing a course of study to a system of question and answer ; and, certainly, no one who ever tried 
it, will hesitate to acknowledge its importance and advantage in the mtthodizins; of knowledge — in 
the stamping it upon memory, in the rendering it distinct, and, in short, in giving it all those quali- 
ties which make it enduring, and at any moment available. The system is applicable to all sciences, 
and in none is more essential than in law, whose complexity exceeds that of all others. Perceiving 
the great profit of his course, as he continued to pursue it, Mr. Kinne, at length, having completed 
Blackstone, digested what he had done, and arranged it, as we now see it, for publication. In testi- 
mony of the value of what he has accomplished the high authorities of Walworth, Kent, Story, 
Cranch, Bouvier, Du Ponceau, Ingeisoll, Paul Brown, and other eminent jurists, must be considered 
as decisive. But by the public at large the volume in question has scarcely yet been known ; a fact 
which is accounted for only by some very unusual scruples of the author, in regard to the mode of 
publication. We are now happy to find that these scruples are removed, and that the book will be 
circulated, as it deserves to be. 

The copy now before us is one of the second edition ; the first having been privately distributed, 
Mr. Kinne has materially enlarged and greatly improved his work, simplifying it by every means in 
Ms power. Among other important points we observe that the oidinary Latin, Greek, French, 
Italian and Saxon law phrases are very properly Anglicised. Many of the original answers are ex- 
tended beyond their former limits, in order to afford a more complete exhibition of the fundamental 
canons of the British law, the great original of our own judicial system, and with a view of making 
the abstracts plain, and easily comprehensible by the general inquirer. He has also interwoven more 
than five hundred additional questions and answers, and appended a very serviceable Index. In its 



330 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

pjEssni form the work must be regarded by all who survey it carefully, as a valuable addition to our 
l^al and ordinary libraries. To the jurist it will be exceedingly useful in its indicial and digestive 
ekffiracter ; to the scholar as an aid in the task of revision and condensation; and to every general 
jcffliler as a convenient manual, not only of law, but of its origin and ^micipia. In the latter respect 
we look upon it as a better book than the " Analysis" of Judge Field. We should have mentioned 
Siiat Mr. K. has judiciously forborne to touch upon those Chapters in the First Book of Blackstone 
i«rMch discuss subjects of a purely local application; such as the king, parliament, etc. He, of course, 
does not consider an acquaintance with the peculiar political structure of the government of Great 
Bjiiain either useless or unimportant, but the subject did not fall within the scope of his plan, which 
was simply to present to the reader an abstract of those laws which regulate the British administra- 
ti©B of justice, and from vvhich so large a portion of our own legal code has been derived. We 
sboald like to say more of this volume, which is indeed of uausual value, and with which we are 
especially taken, as with an important step in the simplification and unquacMng of an unnecessarily 
cosaplex and much bemystified science; but the truth is that the merits of the work speak loudly for 
theiBselves, and thus leave us verj' little to say. 



l%e Life and Aclveniures of Nicholas Nickleby. By Charles Dickens, fBoz.J Author of" Pick- 
'wick Papers,'" •' Oliver Twist," " Sketches of Every-Day Life," etc., etc. With numerous Illus- 
iraiions by Phiz. Lea and Bhmchard, Philadelphia. 

What shall we say of Boz, now that he has completed Nicholas Nickleby 1 Assuredly we could 
^j nothing in the way of commendation, which has not been said already by every person who 
reads. This last effort is perhaps the best of its author ; and this we regard as superlative praise. 
Again ; even of this last effort, the last passages are the most vivid. There could scarcely be a 
more forcible token of the extraordinary powers of the writer. His flight is still upwards. The 
pathos of " Nicholas Nickleby" is, in some respects, chargeable with exaggeration, but in general 
imay be considered as unequalled. Its humor is surpassingly fine. The incidents of the story are 
well conceived and admirably managed ; the interest never flags ; and the total eflect is highly 
graphic and artistical. Charles Dickens is no ordinary man, and his writings must unquestionably 
Jive. We think it somewhat surprising that his serious pieces have elicited so little attention ; but, 
possibly, they have been lost in the blaze of his comic reputation. One of the most forcible things 
ever written is a brief story of his called " The Black Veil," a strangely pathetic and richly imagina- 
tive production, replete with the loftiest tragic ability. 



An Address, Delivered before the GnetheaJi and Diagnothian Societies of Marshall College, at their 
Annual Celebration, September 24, 18c!9. By Joseph K. Chandler. 

We have read this Address thoughtfully, and with great pleasure. It assuredly does its accom- 
p&amp;bed author much credit, and we cannot be surprised at the intense interest with which, as we 
fearn, it was listened to by the institutions before whom it was delivered. Addresses, in general, are 
vsTy ordinary matters, and we dislike to say any thing about them, because we seldom have any 
JljJBg more to say than a few brief words of utter condemnation. The leading features of this branch 
of letters, at the present day, may be summed up in petto — stale wisdom, overdone sentiment, 
Ecliooi-boy classicalities, bad English, worse Latin, and wholesale rhodomontade. Mr. Chandler 
Ibas given us a good Address, and done an original thing. 

Originality is indeed, we think, one of the distinguishing traits of Mr C.'s mind, and the Essay 
BOW before us evinces the faculty in a high degree. He has deviated widely from the usual track 
^pon occasions like the present ; and, at the same time, he has deviated with judgment, and given 
token of the true spirit of independence. He addresses two associations supposed to be deeply im- 
hued with classical partialities. He does not blindly humor these partialities — but boldly confronts, 
aad, just so far as the truth warrants, condemns them. His design is to show the vast superiority 
which modern intellect, and its results, maintain over the boasted civilization and proudest mental 
eflbrts of even the golden Heathen ages — maintain by the means, and through the inspiration of the 
Ight of revelation — through the elevated knowledge of a futurity of existence — and through the 
glowing and burning hopes to which that knowledge of futurity gives rise. This is just such a turn 
as the man of genius might be led to give to a discourse upon an occasion of the kind, and such as only 
the man of genius would have given. 

Mr. Chandler has not merely well conceived the tenor of his Address, but very ably sustained its 
execution throughout. If there is, indeed, any one point of his argument with which we could find 
fach, it is where he yields, in too great measure, we think, the palm of eloquence to the ancients — -

thus weakening his own position. He has not, perhaps, sufficiently borne in mind the distincSsoa 
between eloquence abstractedly considered, and its positive effects. We might safely grant that the 
effects of the oratory of Demosthenes were vaster than those produced by the eloquence of any 
modern, and yet not controvert the idea that the eloquence itself, of the modern, was equal or sape- 
rior to that of the Greek. And this we firmly believe is the case. The circumstances of the au- 
dience make the important difference in the reception of the oration. The Greeks were a highly ex- 
citable and an unread race. They had no printed books. Viva voce exhortations carried with them, 
to their quick apprehensions and passions, all that gigantic force which the neiu possesses. These 
exhortations had, analogically speaking, much of that vivid interest which the first fable has upoa 
the dawning intellect of the child — an interest which is wornaway by the frequent perusal of similar 
things — the frequent inception of similar fancies. The suggestions, the arguments, if any, the ija- 
citements of the ancient rhetorician, were, when compaied with those of the modern, absolutely novel, 
and therefore possessed an immense adventitious force — a force which should be taken into conside- 
ration in a comparative estimate of the eloquence of the two eras. But the truth is, that even jm 
regard to any given Philippic, and any given modern effort of note, we have few means of rigid com- 
parison. Demosthenes appealed to the passions of a populace; the modern orator struggles toswaj 
the intellect of a deliberative assembly. The finest Philippic of the Greek would have been hooted 
at in the British House of Commons, but it may well be doubted whether one of Brougham's adirii- 
able efforts would not have had its weight, even in Athens. 



The Foets of America, iilustrated hy one of her Painters. Edited by John Keese. One volume, 

pp. 284. Colman, New York. 

This long announced and much puffed volume has at last made its appearance. For the sake of 
the publisher, whose enterprising spirit deserves at least the good-will of the critic, we regret tkaS 
we cannot award his beloved bantling a word of honest praise. We are compelled to pronounce this 
" splendid gift book," this loudly-vaunted specimen of American art and science, a common-place 
and profitless attempt. Our readers, who may have perused the fulsome praises bestowed upon tMs 
volume in the generality of the newspapers, will doubtless stare at the opposite nature of our dictsim. 
We are not sold to the will of any publisher ; we never criticise a woik without giving it an atten- 
tive perusal ; we never obtain the gratuitous presentation of expensive publications by the promts© 
of a puff; nor do we covertly slander a brother scribe because he is connected with another periods- 
cal. There are editors who cannot make these averments. The expression of our just opinioas 
may give offence to various individuals, but we are not to be deterred in the execution of our cu&amp;- 
cal duty. 

The editor of " The Poets of America" has wofuUy erred in the selection of some of the autkosrs 
iucluded in his list — we know not whether he has mistaken the quality of the chosen from the lack 
of a kindred spirit with the sons of poetr}- — from an ignorance of the attributes of those wkos® 
names, although not enrolled on the catalogue of his acquaintance, have awakened the echoes of tb« 
bi-forked hill — or whether he has suffered the interference of personal prejudice to warp his judgmeint 
and direct his choice. When we observe that some of the most celebrated poets of the day are ex- 
cluded from his selection, and that various minor lights burn in the highest places, we are tempted 
to doubt the truth of his averment that he has sought to present the finest specimens — the true spkife 
of American poeti}-. There are names in his list " alike to fortune and to fame unknown," and tfas 
merits of their doings will not compensate the reader for the offence of pushing better men from 
their stools. One writer, who has not yet attained the height of mediocrity, has three pieces withim 
eleven pages, while some of the best poets of the age, not being intimately connected with As 
publisher, are compelled to stand the ordeal of a single exhibition, and others are prohibited from all 
chance of show. 

Is the poem whence the following verses arc extracted an honest selection 1 



My grandmama has said — 
Poor old lady ; she is dead 

Long ago — 
That he had a Roman nose, 
And his cheek was like a rose 

In the snow ! 



I know it is a sin 
For me to sit and grin 

At him here ; 
But the old three-cornered hat. 
And the breeches, and all that, 

Are so queer ! 



We should like to know the whereabouts of the mysterious Mrs. ****, and why this anonyoMHiK; 
lady's veiy common-place version of the trite fable of " Love and Friendship" was deemed wortfey 
not only of a place, but of an illustration ? 

The pictures are tolerably fanciful in conception, but their execution is paltry and ineffective ; 
many of them are inferior to the woodcuts in Peter Parley's school books. The editor, in Ms p®-

face, remarks that the design of the present volume is to heighten the brilhancy of our poetic gems 
by the beauty of their setting. We doubt if Simms will thank " the painter" for the clumsy incar- 
nation of his " Zephyr Spirit," or if Charles Sprague will esteem his Shakspeare Ode, which is in- 
deed a gem " of purest lay serene," heightened in value by what the editor terms " spirited and 
graceful sketches, full of beauty and delicacy," which are inexplicable in their detail, and seem as if 
they had been engraved with a sharp fork on the back of a pewter plate. 

The letter press printing is a specimen worthy all praise ; the quality of the paper is unexception- 
able, and the binding deserves a better interior. 



Nix's Mate ; an Historical Romance of America. By the Author of " Athenia of Damascus" 
etc. Two volumes. Colman, New Yorh. 

Mr. Rufus Dawes has given us an original tale, full of exciting incident and wild and wonderful 
achievements. His plot is good, and his characters are well conceived and spiritedly displayed. The 
scenic descriptions are also particularly effective. 

It is a difficult and a dangerous matter to blend the ideal with the real in a narration of historical 
events so well known as the matters connected with Sir Edmond Andros' government of Massachu- 
setts. The introduction of the agency of witches in a New England tale is a good idea, but the 
author has sadly missed his aim in rendering their magical powers most positive and real. The in- 
disputable matter-of-fact details of colonial government assort but strangely with the freaks of an In- 
dian sorceress, exercising unlimited control over the fiends of hell ; and, according to our notions, 
New England witches are somewhat different from Mr. Dawes' hags of the Brocken and the Hartz, 
who leave their German mountains to boil their unholy cauldrons on the beach at Nahant. This 
strange mistake militates against the general effect of the tale ; nevertheless, we believe that the 
publisher will find it the best selling book of the season. 



National Melodies of America. By George P. Morris, Esq. 

There are few cases in which mere popularity should be considered a proper test of merit ; but the 
case of song-writing is, we think, one of the few. When we speak of song-writing we mean, of 
course, the composition of brief poems with an eye to their embodiment in melody. In this ultimate 
destination of the song proper, lies its essence, its genius, its spirit. It is the strict reference to mu- 
sic — the dependence upon modulated expression — which gives to this branch of letters a character 
altogether distinct and unique; which separates it in a ver}^ great measure, and in a manner not suf- 
ficiently considered, from the ordinary proprieties of literature ; which allows it, and even demands 
for it, a vast latitude in its laws; and which absolutely insists upon that certain wild license and in- 
dejinitiveness which is recognized by every musician who is not a mere fiddler, as an important point 
in the philosophy of his science — as the soul of the sensations derivable from its practice — sensations 
which bewilder while they enthral, and which, perhaps, would not so enthral, if they did not so be- 
wilder. 

The sentiments deducible from the conception of sweet sound, are, in themselves, exceedingly in- 
definite ; those derivable from harmony and melody the most indefinite, and the least susceptible of 
analysis, of any with which the metaphysician has to deal. Give to music any undue decision, im- 
bue it with any very determinate tone, and you deprive it, at once, of its ethereal, its ideal, and, as 
we sincerely believe, of its intrinsic and essential character. You dispel its dream-like luxury ; you 
dissolve the atmosphere of the mystic in which its whole nature is bound up ; you exhaust it of its 
breath of filery. It then becomes a tangible and easily appreciable idea — a conception of the earth, 
earthly. It will not, indeed, lose all its power to please, but all which we consider the distinctive- 
ness of that power. And to the uncultivated talent, or to the unimaginative apprehension, this de- 
privation of its most delicate nare will be, not unfrequently , a recommendation. A determinateness 
of expression is sought, — and sometimes by composers who should know better, — is sought as a 
beauty, rather than rejected as a blemish. Thus we have, even from high authorities, attempts at 
absolute imitation in musical sounds. Who can forget, or cease to regret, the many errors of this 
kind into which some great minds have fallen in a moment of precipitate enthusiasm 1 Who can 
forget the failings of the Battles of Pragues ? What man of true taste is not ready to weep over their 
interminable guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbusses, and thunder"? " Vocal music," says L'Abbate 
Gravina, " ought lo imitate the natural language of the human feelings and passions, rather than the 
warblings of Canary birds, which our singers, now-a-days, affect so vastly to mimic with their quaver- 
ings and boasted cadences." This is true only so far as the " rather" is concerned. If any music 
must imitate any thing, it were, perhaps, belter that the imitation should be limited as Gravina has 



REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. 333 

required. But imitation, in its most lespectable aspect, is a foe to the best interests of the lyre. In- 
deed it is an enemy to the best interests of every thing of which we have any acquaintance. 

That character of indejinitiveness wliich is a part of the essence of true music, must be held in view 
by the song-writer ; and, by the critic, should be considered in his estimate of the song. It is, in the 
author, a consciousness, and sometimes an instinctive appreciation, of this character, and of the ne- 
cessity of its maintenance, which imparts to all songs, rightly conceived, that free, affluent, and hearty 
manner, little scrupulous about niceties of phrase, which cannot be better expressed than by the 
French word ahandonnernent, and which is so strikingly exemplified in both the serious and joyous 
ballads and carols of our honest old English progenitors. Wherever verse has been found most 
strictly married to music, this feature prevails. It is, thus, the essence of all antique song. It is the 
soul of Homer, whose Iliad, according to Hedelin at least, is made up "ex tragediis, et variis canti- 
cis de trivio mendicatorum et circulatorum — a la manicre des chansons du Pontneuf." It is the 
spirit of Anacreon. It is even the genius of iEschylus. Coming down to our own times, it is the 
staple of all Moore's happiest efforts — it is the very life of De Beranger. Above all things it is that 
idea which we so vaguely terra nationality in the writing of songs. Wanting this quality no song 
writer was ever truly popular, and, for the reasons we have given, no song writer need ever expect 
to be so. 

But the popularity which General Morris has attained is undoubtedly well deserved, for it is based 
upon the spirit and character which we have discussed. Either a noble instinct, or a high degree of 
acumen, has thrown him, in his songs, upon the very manner and upon the very execution which 
he should have deliberately adopted. We do not intend to insult him, here, by any attempt at regular 
defence from the elaborate nonsense which some of his good friends (those devilish fine fellows) have 
perpetrated in regard to his Melodies. He is quite adequate to that task liimself, whenever circum- 
stances shall render it necessary. We do not mean to defend him — but our spleen is terribly ex- 
cited, and we wish to quarrel with his brethren of the press. These gentlemen — some of them — are very 
large as fault-finders, but very little as critics. And even in what they appear to consider the strong- 
est points of this fault-finding, they are radically wrong. They have made, among other things, a 
prodigious noise about the lines in which Meeta's heart and the morning are said to " break together." 

Her heart and morning broke together 
In the storm. 

Now we know of no reasons whatever, given by the accusers of General Morris fur their dislike 
of the figures here introduced. They have all contented themselves, we believe, with a pure dissent, 
a mere veto, a simple unsupported turning up of the nose. We will therefore aid them by stating 
explicitly the only ground upon which the lines can be condemned. The figures are supposed to 
form what is technically termed a conceit, and to partake of the nature of a pun. The verb " broke," 
in its application to the noun "heart," has, they say, (or rather, would say if they dared) a literal 
signification, while, in its application to " morning" this signification is merely metaphorical. Such 
discrepancies are, we grant, justly denounced by Johnson, by Blair, and by all other critics. This 
we say, is the only possible ground of accusation. But have we to inforfn any person of sound mind 
that, in poetical usage, the breaking of the heart is as strictly metaphorical an expression, as the 
breaking of the morning 1 That the heart does sometimes actually break (as we read in old medical 
books) is a point of knowledge which appertains only to the physician, and with which the poet has 
nothing to do. But we are ashamed of insisting upon a matter with which every school-boy ought 
to be well acquainted. The breaking of the heart, and the breaking of the morning, are, in the lines 
of General Morris, not only both strictly metaphorical phrases, but precisely analogous ones, even if 
not considered metaphorically. This is seen by the substitution of a synonym, in either case, for the 
original word " broke" — a test which could not be borne by words whose similarity lay only in sound. 
It will be perceived, at once, that we can say the heart broke — or burst, and that the morning broke — 
or burst. "The morning burst" is, in fact, a phrase to be found, passim, in the British antique 
poetry. But the truth is that the passage stands in need of no defence of this nature. We might 
admit the conceit very safely. Let us admit it. It is defensible on the score of being in vivid keep- 
ing with that glorious spirit of abandonnement upon which we have commented. To all reasonable 
persons it will be sufficient to say that the hearty, and fervid, and free-spoken songs of Cowley and 
of Donne, and more especially of Cunningham, of Harrington and Carew, abound in precisely similar 
things, and that they are to be met with plentifully in the polished pages of De Beranger, who in- 
troduces them with thought, and retains them after mature deliberation. 



United States' Military Magazine, and Record of all the Volunteers, together with the Army and 
Navy. Huddy and Duval, Philadelphia. 

We observe a great improvement in this Magazine. The last number is very creditable to all con- 
cerned in its publication. The literary matter is appropriate to the work. The embelUshments, too, 



334 burton's gentleman's magazine. 

are well done. The first is a fine lithograph of an oflicer and private of the Troy Citizens' Corps, 
accompanied by an account of that body. The second is also a good plate, representing an officer 
of the Montgomery Light Guard of New York. We have moreover a Grand March entitled the 
National Greys, and composed expressly for the Magazine. Among the literary sketches we observe 
one of the " Battle of Brandywine," and the editor says — " It is not known to whom belongs its 
authorship."' It belongs, however, to John Neal, of Portland, than whom a more graphic or vigorous 
writer is not now living. . 

We believe that the Military Magazine is well supported, and it certainly deserves support. 



Walks and Wanderings in the World of Literature. By the author of " Random Recollections" 
" The Great Metropolis,^' " Sketches of London," etc., etc. Two Volumes. Carey and Hai-t, 
Philadelphia. 

This, as Mr. Giant observes in his preface, is the first attempt of the author at literature, proper- 
ly so called. His previous works were mere compilations — or perhaps worse. We think him wrong, 
however, in leaving the beaten track which he has travelled so successfully — that is to say, if 
success is to be estimated by the sale of a book. His mind, if indeed he has any, is essentially at 
home in statistics, and twaddling gossip, with maudlin commentaries fashioned in imitation of pro- 
fundity. But the idea of his launching his very little vessel into the ocean of original composition, 
has in it, to our apprehensions at least, something supremely fantastic. Mr. Grant has only a faint 
notion of the English language, and, altogether, is one of the flattest writers of his time. The highest 
praise we can award to his " Walks and Wanderings" is that they are not quite as bad as we ex- 
pected them to be. One or two of the pieces may be read, certainly; and there are even one or two 
of them which have an equivocal kind of interest. That " conscience which makes cowards of us 
all" will not permit us to say another word in their favor, or indeed about them in any respect. 



The Good Housekeeper. By Mrs. Sarah J. Hale. W^eeks, Jm-dan and Co., Boston. 

This is a very neat, and certainly a very useful little woik, and will command a ready sale. It is 
unusually full, not only in respect to mere culinary matters, but in regard to a world of household 
afiairs. We have recipes, and useful hints, and economical precepts et id genus omne, of wisdom — 
a genus in which young housekeepers, especially, are apt to be sadly deficient. 

in stooping, a moment, from severer pursuits to one of this humble yet highly important character, 
Mrs. Hale is only following good example — the example of Dr. Kitchener, of our own Miss Leslie,
