THE PERFORMANCE 



Of Shalispeare'' s Comedy of Love's Lahor's Lost before Qmai Elizabeth. 



The subject of the accompanying plate is a fancy sketch by a celebrated English artist, named 
Buss, representing the performance of Shakspeare's comedy of Love's Labor's Lost, before queen 
Elizabeth and her Court. We believe, from the London papers, that the painter intended to repre- 
sent Shakspeare upon the stage before his august patron, in the performance of Don Adriano de Ar- 
mado, a fantastical Spaniard, a character in the above comedy. But we have no authority that the 
dramatist ever performed in the play in question, although we do not possess the power of contra- 
dicting the assertion. The nation and nature of the character, and the quaint allusion contained in 
its name, were undoubtedly designed as a grateful compliment to her virgin majesty. Shakspeare 
was indubitably a courtier, and spared no means of gratifying the weaknesses of Elizabeth and the 
prejudices of the day. The vilifying twisting of the character of Richard IIL, the mortal enemy of 
the giandfather of the queen, is a convincing evidence in support of our assertion. 

The play of Love's Labor's Lost (so named in the folio of 1623,) is generally supposed to be the 
earliest of Shakspeare's productions. Malone assigns 1591 as the date of the original drama, but 
changed it afterwards, with sufficient reason, to 1594. Chalmers supposes 1592 as the year wherein 
this comedy was written, but gives no satisfactory cause for his preference. The original edition of 
this play is doubtless lost, for the oldest copy extant, dated 1598, is said, in the title page, to be 
" newly corrected and augmented." In 1597, it was represented at Wliitehall palace, before queen 
Elizabeth, by her express desire — we are then to suppose that we possess the copy of the piece as it 
■was " newly corrected and augmented" for the purpose of exhibition before her majesty. 

We have said that there is no autho.ity extant for the assu nption that Shakspeare personated 
Armado, even at the command of her majesty the quean. At the same time, if he played in

piece, he was likely to select tlie character of the thrasonical Spaniard, inasmuch as the broad hu- 
mors of the other masquers rendered them unavailable to an actor of our poet's calibre, and the parts 
of the dashing and witty courtiers were above his pitch.
